**Introduction**
- First time presenting at Troopers
- Works at CMO, researching Apple products
- Focuses on the Apple Watch due to its ubiquity and array of sensors

**Why the Apple Watch is Interesting**
- **Ubiquitous**: Worn 24/7, packed with sensors for geolocation, health monitoring, and activity tracking
- **Intimate Health Data**: Heart rate, blood oxygen, sleep temperature, etc., raising security and privacy concerns
- **Seamless Integration with iPhone**: Wireless data transfer via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, syncing health data, contacts, calendar, etc.

**Two Perspectives on Apple Watch Security**
- **Data Security**: Ensuring sensitive health data is secure and accessible only to authorized users/devices
- **Breaking the Walled Garden**: Exploring beyond Apple's intended functionality, querying raw data, and customizing the device

**Technical Details of Apple Watch and iPhone Communication**
- **Health Data Synchronization**: Uses NanoSync protocol to sync health data between watch and phone via local SQLite databases
- **Alloy Messaging Bus**: Handles communication between watch and phone services, utilizing TCP connections and topic strings for message routing
- **VPN Tunnel**: Apple uses IPSec to secure communication, adding encryption and authentication on top of Wi-Fi/Bluetooth
- **Shoes Protocol**: Powers internet sharing, allowing watch to access phone's cellular connection via a TCP server

**Security Analysis**
- **Trust Boundaries**: Terminus daemon handles unencrypted data, while identity services daemon acts as a hub for watch communication, interacting with multiple services/binaries
- **IKEv2 Handshake Vulnerability**: Apple's custom extensions accept unencrypted messages with private Notify types, allowing IP address updates and potential redirection to attacker-controlled devices
- **A over C Encryption**: Apple's custom encryption for sensitive data, using iMessage crypto and AES CBC, susceptible to bit flip attacks and plaintext manipulation

**Security Takeaways**
- **Standards and Crypto**: Established standards and solid cryptography enhance security, but custom extensions and complex interactions can introduce vulnerabilities
- **Crypto Won't Always Save You**: Apple's custom crypto has flaws, emphasizing the importance of using established standards and avoiding custom solutions
- **Reduce Complexity**: Simplifying protocols and removing deprecated code reduces the attack surface and potential for vulnerabilities

**Interoperability and Breaking the Walled Garden**
- **Antitrust Complaints**: Apple cited for limiting interoperability, selectively compromising security/privacy, and restricting third-party smartwatch functionality
- **WatchWitch**: Android app that communicates with Apple Watch, syncing health data, enabling internet sharing, and providing text messaging
- **Security and Interoperability**: WatchWitch prioritizes security while demonstrating the possibility of secure interoperability, giving users more control over their devices

**Demonstration of WatchWitch Features**
- Health data synchronization, internet sharing, fine-grained firewall, text messaging, and health data visualization
- Initial pairing requires a jailbroken iPhone, but communication can be maintained solely between the watch and Android device

**Takeaways for Interoperability**
- Secure interoperability is achievable, providing users with more control and customization options
- Emphasizes the importance of device ownership and the ability to create software that suits users' needs, not just the manufacturer's interests

**Upcoming Releases and Tools**
- Paper, app release, Wireshark dissectors, documentation, Bluetooth connectivity improvements, and ByteWitch (a tool for decoding serialized data)

**Q&A**
- Further exploration of AOC encryption and IKEv2 vulnerabilities is suggested
- iPhone jailbreak was used for Bluetooth message interception, but the Apple Watch remains unmodified
- Fuzzing the IKEv2 custom notification messages is a potential area for further research
