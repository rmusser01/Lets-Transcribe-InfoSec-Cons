**Introduction**
- Context: ongoing developments in AI security
- Disclaimer: ongoing involvement in a complex, time-sensitive project
- Focus: practical considerations for AI security

**AI Security Landscape**
- Current discourse:
  - Extreme ends of the spectrum: Twitter posts vs. academic papers
  - Lack of practical guidance for practitioners
- Goal: provide actionable insights for practitioners

**Understanding AI Security**
- Distinguishing AI security from traditional application security
- OWASP Top 10 for LLMs:
  - Majority of issues relate to model protection and plugin design
  - Only a few unique challenges, e.g., model denial of service, insecure pre-training data
- Key takeaway: focus on new challenges while applying existing security best practices

**Generative AI and Security**
- Generative AI, e.g., chatbots and assistants, is a rapidly growing field
- OpenAI's ecosystem: GPTs and Assistants
- Configuration via natural language: a significant security challenge
- Non-deterministic behavior: a fundamental aspect of AI, but a security concern
- Traditional security approaches, like whitelisting, are challenging to apply

**Exploring AI Targets**
- Instructions and limitations: critical to understand and define
- Actions and capabilities: potential vectors for abuse
- Trust boundaries: a key concept, often overlooked or misapplied

**Examples and Demonstrations**
- Function extraction: understanding the capabilities and logic of AI systems
- Prompt injection: a powerful tool for extracting functions and information
- Red line: the point at which AI security becomes a critical issue
- Information disclosure: a common issue, challenging to mitigate

**Paradigm Shift in Vulnerability Handling**
- Traditional approaches are inadequate for AI systems
- Attacks and testing are unreliable and time-consuming
- Whitelisting is ideal but challenging to implement
- Holistic view: combine application, infrastructure, and AI-specific security measures

**Final Thoughts**
- Trust boundaries are crucial: understand and define them clearly
- Treat AI input and output as untrusted
- AI will weaken constraints if it deems other priorities more important
- Stay informed, inspired, and motivated to address AI security challenges
