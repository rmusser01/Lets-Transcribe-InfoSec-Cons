## Introduction
- **Troopers24**: IT security conference in Heidelberg, Germany
- **Topic**: A new feature of Windows called **Smart App Control**
- **Speakers**: Tillmann Oswald and Dr. Baptiste David

## Smart App Control
- Introduced with Windows 11, version 22572
- **Purpose**: Block what Microsoft considers "unsafe applications"
- Focuses on defining and allowing only **safe applications** to run
- **Not an antivirus solution**: Moves away from the trust model based on application trustworthiness
- **Based on** **WDAC** **(Windows Defender Application Control)**: A feature that helps mitigate security threats by restricting applications
- **Three stages**: Evaluation, enforcement, and off
- **Evaluation mode**: Observes system activity, application usage, and provides feedback
- **Enforcement mode**: Blocks untrusted applications; no exceptions allowed
- **Off mode**: Disables Smart App Control, but it cannot be reactivated without reinstalling Windows
- **Requires internet connection**: Blocks applications when unable to connect to the cloud for analysis
- **Exceptions**: Applications signed with certificates from trusted authorities, including Microsoft applications
- **No third-party integration**: Only Windows Defender can interface with Smart App Control

## Smart App Control Functionality
- Explorer.exe executes an application, which goes through a long path to the kernel to create a new process
- The kernel notifies **ci.dll** (Code Integrity.dll) to check if the application can be allowed to run
- ci.dll checks **Windows policies** (XML files) that define which applications can run based on signatures and metadata
- **WDAC policy matching**: The kernel checks a system cache to see if the application has already been analyzed and allowed
- If not in the cache, the **cipApplySipPolicyExit** function is called with various parameters:
  - **Validation context**: Details about the application (path, signature, etc.)
  - **Policy objects**: Number of WDAC policies in the system
  - **Validation procedure**: Specific treatment or callback for each policy
- **SAC** (Smart App Control) is a specific procedure and policy that directs the system to use SAC
- SAC checks the file extension and makes a transition to user mode for analysis
- **KripCat Service**: A service launched at Windows boot time, responsible for checking certificate chains and managing catalog files
- KripCat Service interfaces with **Windows Defender** via an **RPC** (Remote Procedure Call) connection
- Windows Defender has a complex architecture with multiple components and uses asynchronous processing and thread pools
- Windows Defender performs a memory scan of the file and generates a **Spynet report** for communication with Microsoft

## Communication with Microsoft
- The Spynet report includes machine information, Windows Defender version, configuration, and file metadata
- The report is sent to **wdcp.microsoft.com** with user agent and OS information
- Microsoft's response includes feedback about the analyzed file and potential information about Smart App Control mode
- The response is personalized for Smart App Control analysis and is used to make decisions about blocking or allowing applications
- Windows Defender notifies CI.dll about the response, which then updates policies and notifies the user via RPC or **WNF** (Windows Notification Framework) notifications

## Windows Defender Logging
- Windows Defender has two types of logs: regular log text files and **ETW** (Event Tracing for Windows) provider
- ETW provider is a valuable source of information but is protected by a security flag
- The security flag can be removed using a debugger (Winbag) to access detailed logging information
- ETW provider shows step-by-step detection of a DLL injection attack, including open process, memory allocation, and thread creation

## Conclusion and Questions
- Smart App Control's complexity and reliance on WDAC raise questions about its necessity
- Microsoft may have intended to automate WDAC configuration using cloud reputation
- Smart App Control is not an antivirus but has similar functionality and relies on Windows Defender
- The position of Windows Defender in the system and its disclosure of information to Microsoft are concerns
- There is no documented way for third-party applications to interface with Smart App Control
- **SAC cannot be reactivated once turned off**: Reinstalling Windows is required
- **Switching between enforcement and evaluation modes**: Not possible; once in enforcement, cannot go back to evaluation
