**Introduction and Recap**
- The speaker, Jorge de Almeida Pinto, works as an incident response consultant for Semperis.
- The presentation focuses on the process of performing a forced recovery on an Active Directory (AD) and reconnecting it to Azure AD or Enter ID.
- A forced recovery involves going back in time to a previous backup, which may not contain objects created after the backup and may include objects deleted after the backup.
- The main goal is to prevent deletions of objects in the intra-ID during the recovery process.

**Impact of Forced Recovery**
- A forced recovery can result in a mismatch between the data in Active Directory and intra-ID, with intra-ID knowing more.
- It is important to perform a gap analysis to identify missing objects and recreate them.
- Immutable IDs are crucial for gluing the on-prem representation and intra-ID representation together.
- The goal is to prevent deletions and recreate missing objects, rather than fully restoring them.

**Backup Choice**
- When choosing a backup, consider the security state and the delta of changes.
- It is generally easier to fix the security of your ID than to deal with larger deltas of changes.
- The smaller the delta, the less headaches you will have in rejoining machines and dealing with password mismatches.

**Detailed Steps**
- Disable synchronization and simulate a forced recovery by deleting objects.
- Get synchronized objects and create a database to store the data.
- Create a domain translation list to determine the domain and domain controller for object creation.
- Check which objects exist and which are missing in AD.
- Recreate missing objects and fix object relationships.
- Enable Cloud Sync and Connect Sync, performing checks to ensure no deletions occur.
- Compare the state before and after synchronization.

**Things to be Aware Of**
- Forced recovery makes AD authoritative, but intra-ID knows more due to the restore.
- Deletion of objects is a concern, as the recycle bin in Azure only applies to certain object types.
- It is important to start the recovery process as soon as possible, especially in large environments.
- Recreating objects requires immutable IDs, which can be obtained through the DeerSync API.
- Be cautious when removing group memberships, as it may affect objects that are not synced.
- Consider UPN and directory extensions, and know your data model and synchronization rules.

**Demo Setup**
- The demo environment includes a single domain forest, no exchange, basic free tenant, CloudSync and ConnectSync, and predictable data.
- The speaker will delete the first 12 objects of each object type for each sync engine.
- PHS is used, and immutable IDs are set to the default MSDS consistency group.
- ConnectSync synchronization rules have been updated to fix issues with the default rules.

**Demo Walkthrough**
- The speaker authenticates and disables Cloud Sync and Connect Sync.
- Objects are deleted to simulate a forced recovery.
- Information is retrieved from the Deer Sync API to determine the configuration of Azure AD Connect Sync.
- Synchronized objects are obtained and stored in a database.
- A domain translation table is created.
- Objects are checked against AD to identify missing objects.
- Missing objects are recreated, and object relationships are fixed.
- Cloud Sync and Connect Sync are enabled, and checks are performed to prevent deletions.
- The state is compared before and after synchronization.

**Challenges and Future Work**
- The speaker encountered challenges with Cloud Sync, where objects were deleted even after performing the recovery process.
- More testing and investigation are needed to fully understand the behavior of Cloud Sync in this scenario.
- The speaker plans to create a blog post explaining the setup and providing the demo code for others to try and improve upon.

**Q&A**
- The speaker answers questions from the audience, providing additional insights and clarifications.
- The discussion covers topics such as attribute changes, the impact of having Exchange, and the challenges of dealing with authoritative data.
- The speaker emphasizes the importance of testing and customization in these scenarios.
