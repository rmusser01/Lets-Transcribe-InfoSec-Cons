- Topic: Windows **Registry** and its potential for **remote exploitation**

**Windows Registry Basics**
- History: Introduced in **Windows 3.1** (1992) for **COM-based components**
- Anatomy: Hierarchical database with multiple **root keys** (e.g., HKLM, HKU, HKCU)
- HKLM: Contains **computer-specific data** and **settings** (e.g., local policies, group policies)
- HKU: Includes **user-specific settings** and **hives** for individual users and system services
- HKCR: Provides a **consolidated view** of HKLM and HKCU software classes, with HKCU taking **precedence**
- COM (Component Object Model): Enables **inter-process communication**, including **DCOM** for communication **across the network**

**Remote Interaction with the Registry**
- MSRRP (Microsoft Remote Registry Protocol): Enabled by default on **servers**, disabled on **clients**
- Accessible via **name pipe** (IPC$) without requiring local admin privileges
- WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation): Alternative method, requires local admin privileges

**Abusing the Remote Registry**
- Reading HKLM: Requires local admin privileges, but some paths are accessible to domain users (e.g., build version, product ID, event log providers)
- HKU and HKCR: Accessible to domain users, providing information about logged-in users and system usage
- RPC Information Leaks: Techniques to determine the existence of remote keys and files without admin privileges
- ADCS (Active Directory Certificate Services): Certificate templates cached in the registry, allowing for offline analysis of escalation paths

**Lateral Movement and Code Execution**
- HKLM Modification: Requires admin privileges, but can be achieved through COM hijacks and specific keys (e.g., **software Microsoft app model lookaside machine**)
- Triggering COM Objects: Identifying services that can be started via RPC calls, even on domain controllers
- HKCU Modification: Modifying COM objects under a specific user, potentially bypassing MFA requirements in Citrix environments
- Handle Notification: Modifying registry keys monitored by applications, leading to process crashes and loading of desired COM objects

**Conclusion**
- The Windows Registry provides a wealth of information and potential attack vectors for remote exploitation.
- Techniques discussed include remote reconnaissance, lateral movement, and code execution through COM hijacks and RPC interactions.
