**Introduction**
- Reinhard Kugler's talk at TROOPERS24 IT security conference
- Focus on automotive container security using **eBPF**

**Automotive Security Concerns**
- Personal experience with infotainment system malfunction
- Concerns about car being hacked or having a virus
- Reference to the "cheap hack" incident from almost 10 years ago
    - Remote attack on a car, controlling driving functions and behavior
- Interest in modern mitigation techniques, specifically containers

**Containerization and Virtualization**
- Using containers to centralize software functions and improve security
- Containers provide isolation through namespaces and control groups
- Discussion of virtualization layers, with emphasis on operating system virtualization
- **eBPF** (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) allows extending kernel functionality
- eBPF programs can be attached to events like system calls or network packets
- eBPF is widely used, including by systemD and containers

**Use Cases for eBPF in Automotive Security**
- Isolating applications within containers, e.g., seat heating application
- CAN bus security: using eBPF to block or filter CAN messages
- Software updates: using eBPF to trace and control SPI bus transactions
- Preventing injection of CAN messages and unauthorized software updates

**eBPF Rootkits**
- Potential use of eBPF in rootkits, with existing resources and examples
- Demonstration of a simple eBPF rootkit for CAN bus manipulation

**Conclusion and Outlook**
- Importance of keeping up with evolving technologies like containers and eBPF
- eBPF and containers have reached a mature level, especially in the cloud space
- Need for similar automation tools in IoT and automotive domains
- Acknowledgments to contributors and collaborators
- Encouragement to explore container security further
