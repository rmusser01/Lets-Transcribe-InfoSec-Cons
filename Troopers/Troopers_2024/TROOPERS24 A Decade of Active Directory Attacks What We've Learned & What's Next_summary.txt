- **Introduction**: Sean Metcalf, a Microsoft Certified Master in Active Directory, founded Trimark, a company specializing in Active Directory and Enter ID security assessments. He highlights his previous talks at various conferences, including Troopers in 2018 and 2019, and his passion for the Troopers community.

- **Agenda**: Metcalf covers the Active Directory attack timeline, breaking it down into three eras: "Baby Steps" (2000-2009), "Wonder Years" (2010-2014), and "Golden Years" (2015-2019). He also discusses structuring effective Active Directory defenses, hybrid cloud integration attacks and defenses, and ways to protect the Enter ID environment.

- **Baby Steps (2000-2009)**: This era sets the foundation for Active Directory attacks. Notable milestones include Paul Ashton's introduction of the concept of "pass the hash" in 1997, CDC's release of the SMB relay toolkit in 2001, and the creation of tools like MBN-NEST spoof (2007) and the Pass the Hash toolkit (2008), which later became the Windows Credential Editor (WCE).

- **Wonder Years (2010-2014)**: The Wonder Years witness the development of powerful tools and techniques for attacking Active Directory. Notable milestones include the release of Mimikatz by Benjamin Delpy, inspired by WCE, and the discovery of vulnerabilities in Group Policy Preferences by Emilien Gural in 2012. The same year, Responder, a tool for capturing NTLM hashes, is introduced. In 2013, Invoke-Mimikatz brings PowerShell into the equation, allowing attackers to bypass security controls. 2014 marks a turning point with the infamous "Golden Ticket" talk by Delpy and Skip Duckwell, followed by the discovery of "Silver Tickets" by Duckwell and the release of Kerberos by Tim Medin. Will Schroeder releases PowerView, providing extensive reconnaissance capabilities.

- **Golden Years (2015-2019)**: This era sees an explosion of tools and techniques, building on the foundations laid in the previous years. Notable milestones include the release of DSInternals by Michael Grafnetter, providing powerful PowerShell tools for offline editing of Active Directory databases. Kekeo, a pure Kerberos toolset by Delpy, is also released. BloodHound, by Will Schroeder, Rohan Vazarkar, and Andy Robbins, revolutionizes reconnaissance with graph theory. DeathStar by byt3bl33d3r automates Active Directory attacks. DCShadow, discovered by Dirk-jan Mollema, allows attackers to manipulate Active Directory replication. Other notable tools and techniques include GhostPack, Rubeus, PrinterBug, and Wagging the Dog by Elad Shamir, which highlights the power of resource-based constrained delegation.

- **Third Age (2020-Present)**: The most recent era continues to build on previous advancements, with tools like Atalanch, Certified Pre-Owned, Kerberoast, and PetitPotem exploiting vulnerabilities in Active Directory and relaying attacks.

- **Effective Active Directory Defenses**: Metcalf emphasizes the importance of breaking reconnaissance by restricting permissions and disabling outdated protocols. He also highlights the need to secure sensitive accounts, protect service account security, and ensure physical and virtual security for domain controllers.

- **Hybrid Cloud Attacks and Defenses**: With the shift to the cloud, new attack vectors emerge. Seamless Single Sign-On (SSO), Azure AD Connect, and ADFS servers become attractive targets for attackers. Protecting these systems is crucial, especially considering the potential for cleartext password capture and MFA bypass.

- **Securing Enter ID Administration**: Metcalf highlights the importance of identifying and protecting privileged roles and permissions in cloud environments, such as global administrator and hybrid identity administrator. He also emphasizes the need for strong authentication and conditional access policies for cloud admins.

- **Conclusion**: Active Directory security has evolved significantly over the years, and defenders now have better tools and techniques at their disposal. However, attackers continue to find new vulnerabilities and exploit hybrid cloud integrations. To stay resilient, organizations must keep up with defensive techniques, secure hybrid cloud components, and prioritize Enter ID administration security.
