**Overview:**
- Talk by **Julian Suleder** and **Peter Hecko** at **TROOPERS24** IT security conference.

**Healthcare Provider Context:**
- Helios, **Europe's largest healthcare provider**, with:
  - 89 clinics and 230 medical care centers.
  - 5.5 million patients treated annually.
  - 62,000 clients and 10,000 servers.

**IT Environment Challenges:**
- **Active Directory**: 140,000 users, 130,000 groups, and 140,000 objects.
- **150 Domain Controllers** and approximately 35,000 **IoMT** devices.
- **SOC** with 18 members handling around 40 incidents daily.
- Compliance with numerous **regulations** and standards specific to the healthcare industry in Germany.

**Physical Access Challenges:**
- Publicly accessible buildings operating 24/7.
- Difficulty in restricting access to network ports and medical devices.
- Example: reprogramming 400 electronic doors due to software issues, requiring a week's work for five people.

**Medical Device Integration Challenges:**
- Interconnectivity between various manufacturers' systems and infrastructures.
- Central systems requiring integration with **Active Directory**, leading to a high number of roles and permissions.
- Challenges with backup processes, remote management, and operating system dependencies.
- Lack of standardization across different hospitals and vendors.

**Suggested Approaches:**
- **ITSM** implementation and centralization of core infrastructure, SOC, and support processes.
- Standardization and harmonization of security monitoring and support across locations.
- Efficient utilization of human resources through strategic planning and regular assessments.
- Development of internal standards and strong adherence to them, with vendors adapting to these standards.

**Community Engagement:**
- Emphasis on the need for community collaboration to establish open standards.
- Reference to the automotive industry's progress in this regard, with healthcare lagging.
- Potential role of regulators in supporting and guiding the process.

**Conclusion:**
- Acknowledgment of the complexity and challenges in securing healthcare IT environments.
- Encouragement for community engagement and standardization to address these issues effectively.
