## Introduction
- **Christopher**: Security analyst in the Security Operations Centre at Audi with a background in software development and security in the automotive industry. Currently working on a PhD thesis.
- **Karsten**: Security engineer at Audi with 15+ years of experience in the automotive domain, specializing in IoT/embedded security and hardware security.
- Both speakers teach automotive security within the company to transfer knowledge and experience to the new generation of security engineers.

## Automotive Industry Overview
- **Karsten**: Audi's production plant in Ingolstadt showcases the combination of German engineering and modern technology, feeding raw materials and producing cars with the help of robots and workers.
- The Volkswagen group includes various brands like Audi and Volkswagen, sharing software, hardware, and components, but a compromised supplier can affect multiple brands.
- Annually, the group releases around 9 million cars, each with its own set of vulnerabilities, creating a significant challenge for security monitoring.

## Security Achievements and Challenges
- **Karsten**: Established framework and architecture for building modern cars, adapting security technologies like key management systems.
- Achieved external certification for cyber security management, fulfilling ISO 21.434 and UN ECE RR 155 regulations, with established processes for homologation.
- Training plans implemented for stakeholders in the development process for security functionalities.
- **Challenges**: Dealing with varying laws and regulations in different countries, leading to modifications in hardware and software for specific markets.
- Managing a wide range of tools available on the grey market, some of which are used for illegal activities like mileage adjustment and key programming for stolen cars.
- Keeping up with the cat-and-mouse game between OEMs and grey market actors, who actively work to overcome protection mechanisms.

## Security Monitoring and Incident Response
- **Karsten**: Security monitoring encompasses vehicles, plants, IT services, customers, and social media, with a focus on impact analysis.
- **Christopher**: Intrusion detection system alerts may not provide clear indications of malicious activity, requiring analysts to review complex documentation and specifications.
- **Frustration Equation**: Summarized as the sum of active incidents, complexity, inverse of automation, and the number of areas involved, helping to discuss and optimize incident handling processes.
- **Documentation**: Various formats (wikis, Microsoft products, email, Autosa, Vector) and multiple suppliers/sub-suppliers make it challenging to access relevant information.
- **Automation**: Vital for managing incidents effectively, but vendor lock-in can hinder customization and adaptability.

## Automotive Security Complexity
- **Karsten**: Modern cars are complex networks with numerous ECUs, protocols (Ethernet, CAN, FlexRay, etc.), IP addresses, and signal types.
- External communication includes key fobs, diagnostics, car-to-car, car-to-infrastructure, and car-to-smart home interactions, creating potential attack vectors.
- **Christopher**: Vehicle security is critical due to the potential consequences of a breach, and the complexity of the supply chain makes it challenging to ensure security throughout.

## Security Challenges and Opportunities
- **Karsten**: Compromised suppliers, malicious activity (e.g., USB misuse, backend system misuse), implementation issues, and hardware problems are common challenges.
- **Christopher**: While processes, documentation, and VSOCs are in place, the complex supply chain and variety of protocols make security monitoring difficult.
- **Data Model**: Created to represent the relationship between components, enabling graph queries, visualization, and metadata addition.
- **AI**: Can be leveraged to support analysts by processing alerts, scanning documentation, and providing relevant data, but it shouldn't replace human analysts.

## Q&A
- Data in the model includes communication-related information, but not third-party library usage. Extending the model with software version information is a future goal.
- Challenges with suppliers include denial of security incidents, lack of transparency with sub-suppliers, and difficulty in obtaining software version information.
- Most common attacks are related to immobilizer functionality, enabling functions without payment, and adjusting mileage or battery state of charge.
- Long life cycle of IT devices in terms of security patch management is a complex issue, similar to challenges faced by the aviation industry.
