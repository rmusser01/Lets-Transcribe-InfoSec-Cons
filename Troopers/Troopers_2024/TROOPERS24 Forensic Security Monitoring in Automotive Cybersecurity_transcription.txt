 Okay, so thank you for the introduction, thank you for letting us having this talk today.  So before we start we give a short introduction, so I introduce myself.  My name is Christopher, I'm a security analyst in the Security Operations Centre at Audi  and my background is mostly in software development and security in the automotive industry and  at the moment I'm also working on my PhD thesis, so yeah, that's about me.  Okay, and let me introduce myself, I'm a security engineer at Audi with more than 15 years experience  in the automotive domain.  Basically I work in the IoT or embedded security and that means network security for cars that  it's CAN, Ethernet and also hardware security that means more or less trying to close all  the different debug interfaces on all the different issues we have inside the car and  also to define new technologies which is available on modern microcontrollers, modern microprocessors  like HSMs, trust zones and so on and so on.  Together with Christopher we teach automotive security in our company and the idea behind  this is to, the knowledge and the experience we have collected over the years to transfer  to the new generation of security engineers.  And some kind of fun fact, if I'm not trying to secure our cars I really like to do something  with my hands and this picture shows me building a canoe and the funny thing about this canoe  is that I can go away from all the security stuff and the really funny thing is that the  only thing I built which can be used for transportation which is immune against cyber  hacking.  Okay, so before we dive into deeper a short disclaimer, you all know how this works, we  here privately so we represent our opinion not the opinion of our employee and if you  have questions to products and anything I'm sorry we can't answer them but feel free to  ask questions later, I hope there are some.  So to question first, is anybody here working in the automotive industry besides the two  of us?  Okay, one person, sorry, are you working for Continental?  No?  Good, because we have them in the slides later.  So Karsten will introduce the environment we're working in and...  One of the problems we have for the people which are not have the knowledge about automotive  industry, the problem which needs to be understand is how automotive industry works and this  picture shows the Audi plant in Ingolstadt and round about 75% of this area are more  or less production facilities and to understand automotive industry, what does it mean?  It means that we have this production plant and we are feeding from one side material,  steel, aluminium, whatever and some issues into the factory and then some robots with  all the OT stuff and together with the workers performing some kind of magic and afterwards  nice cars leaving the factories.  And to be honest, even for us with quite a lot of experience and a long time at Audi,  even for us it's to some extent it's a magic that the cars coming out of the production  line.  And if somebody of you is visiting Ingolstadt, take the time, take a tour, there are some  tours available at the factory line, it's really impressive.  And for me this is some kind of combination of German engineering and modern technology  and this combination, that's what defines automotive industry, automotive technology.  Okay, so to give you a more in-depth look at what we're dealing with, so some of you  might have heard of Audi and of other brands, Volkswagen, but it's not just the one company  because we all belong to Volkswagen, it's a bunch of companies and so we call that slide  sharing is a double-edged sword because yeah, you have some advantages when you share stuff  but you also have disadvantages and so what we're sharing is from the IoT perspective  several platforms, so the software, hardware, components and when it comes to IT and OT  we also do that and yeah, but that also means if one of the suppliers for example is compromised  it also means it's a fair chance that that supplier also works for all the other brands  and everyone's affected.  And to also give you a small in-depth look, so I collected this number, it's not to brag,  it's just to give you an imagination of the IoT devices, so our company releases around  9 million devices every year.  You mean cars?  Cars, yeah, so for us IoT at that point is a car and so every year that means if some  vehicle is vulnerable to anything, we have after two years 18 million and so on, so on,  so it's quite a number.  And we also did some achieve, we achieved some stuff in the past and Carsten will explain  that to you.  Yeah, I think it's important to understand what we have achieved regarding security to  now and first of all we have an established framework and an established architecture  for building modern cars and maybe you have heard about this EQ 1.2 architecture, probably  somebody of you have read something in the newspapers about this, but this framework  means that we have adapted security technologies for the usage inside the car and adapted  means that these technologies are streamlined for the automotive usage.  For instance we have a special kind of key management system in order to put keys in  our IoT devices inside the cars with a lot of different issues inside the cars.  Then of course we have also some kind of, we have reached some kind of external certification  regarding the cyber security management system and to some extent to have this cyber security  management system sounds like a lot of paperwork and to be honest it's really a lot of paperwork,  but without this paperwork we do not reach the homologation and the homologation is needed  in order to sell cars to the customer.  So at the end of the day we need to fulfil the ISO 21.434, we need to fulfil the regulations  from the UN ECE RR 155 and all this stuff is to some extent established, it's working,  everything is in place and we have all the different processes which are needed in order  to fulfil these requirements from the authorities in place and to some extent we have already  reached the homologation for some cars and it's quite important for us.  And we also have established, how to say, a training plan for all the different stakeholders  in the development process for security functionalities inside the car and to some extent also for the IT part.  Okay, so that was kind of the boring stuff, let's get into...  But it's important.  Yeah, it's important unfortunately.  So what have we confronted lately?  So if you're not working in the industry it's hard to imagine what we're dealing with and  if it comes to laws and other stuff.  So most of you know the GDPR, so data protection, but what we're dealing with is if you want  to sell cars in different countries, different countries have different laws and the US and  China and South Korea, that's the examples we picked here, they were the first to really  engage with these new laws and it sometimes means we're not allowed to introduce certain  hardware, for example in China you're not allowed to put certain encryption hardware  there because I think they're afraid people can disassemble the car and build some messaging  service for themselves and we have software components that we're not allowed to.  So that means we have to create different ECUs for the same car, different ECUs for  different countries.  If you look at attackers and criminals, I mean we are hearing that a lot in the Troopers  Conference, everyone's dealing with them, but it means we have huge challenges for our  organisation and for our processes.  But the most important thing is we're talking about security monitoring today and that also  means we have to deal with new requirements towards security monitoring, but that's not  the only thing we're dealing with.  The other thing we have quite a huge problem, there are quite a lot of different tools available  on the, I call it the grey market, there are some fancy tools which can be used for some  kind of legal stuff, because some of these tools solve real problems which to some extent  difficult to handle with the official VW toolset.  But there's a small line between legal activities and illegal activities and for instance this  one, this device, the Stigiprog, is promoted as a system for speedometer repair, but at  the end of the day it means to adjust the mileage.  The other ones in the left is used for teaching new key fobs for a car.  Even this is to some extent a valid use case if somebody loses a key, but in most cases  this toolset is used for handling stolen cars.  The other one in the bottom is used for modifying the diagnostic communication between some  testers and even some official testers and the car in order to enable some functions  which normally are not enabled.  And the problem we have, there are quite a lot of these persons on the grey market and  they have quite a lot of their own research and development infrastructure, they are to  some extent quite motivated to develop new tools to overcome our protection mechanism  and at the end of the day it's some kind of cat and mouse running between the OEM and  these guys and we are trying hard to ensure the security of our cars and also, that's  the important part, the security and the safety of our customers.  Okay so we collected some recent events that happened, so that's why I asked about Continental  because it's on one of our slides, but that's stuff you're all dealing with at some regard  and so the question is, who of you is also working in a security operations centre or  is related to being an analyst?  Okay there's a couple, okay so you can relate to this.  So if stuff like this happens and most of the time unfortunately it's in the press before  we know about, well we get asked about it and so if you see in the press like FBI joins  investigation at Continental and we have some managers at our company that like, oh Continental  has something to do with us, they all get nervous and so what they usually do is, someone  shows up and it's like, oh what's the impact on the stolen or leaked crypto, do we use  infrastructure of this supplier and how bad is it that the ECU was compromised for example  and how would we prioritise the mitigation and to be fair it's like, you have to tell  me now situation and to be fair we can't tell at that moment and that's okay.  And so if we look at all the data source that we have and probably you all know the cycle,  so we want to detect, analyse, mitigate and learn from it.  Today we are focusing on the analyse aspect and more on the impact analyse and so we not  only have the vehicle, we already mentioned that, we have the plant, we have IT services  that are related to that and we have to do security monitoring on all of this.  And we have also the customers.  And we have customers and we have social media and if you had this experience, some of the  hints we get are happening on social media and so that's something we also have to monitor  and I don't mean threat intelligence, I just mean customers that are complaining or they  are afraid their car was hacked for example.  And so we are diving into the vehicle security operation centre environment and the scope  on impact.  Christopher, you have access to the vehicle operation centres, you have access to all  this kind of information we have at our company.  It couldn't be that hard to get the information and to get answers to our manager.  Yeah, well unfortunately it is and so to show you what today could look like of an analyst,  we start with a small example.  So we just assume we have some intrusion detection system, we have an alert on that system and  we have an analyst and so he thinks well there's something malicious, no problem, I can look  at this and if I just look hard enough at the documentation that's available and so  no one here is working in the automotive industry except two people but so that joke doesn't  work that well because the file formats we mentioned here, they are just awful.  You can't read them actually, you need a lot of, it's XML most of it.  So it's really hard and the problem is if someone asks you so there's a signal that's  compromised, what's the impact of the signal and we just look at a technical specification  that says well for example it's a TCP packet, yeah, the specification says it goes from  device 1 to device 2, the length and other metadata but you don't know if it's bad,  if it's some sort of malicious and so in the end and you can relate to that, if you  don't know, you just send an email to everyone, it's like does anybody know what the signal  is for and what's the impact and unfortunately that happens more than we wanted to but to  give you a perspective, like I said in this company, in the group there are several hundred  thousand employees so we have several engineering departments and suppliers so it's not like  you could call one person and they know it so that's a problem, fragmentation.  So we come back to that later and so the next question is if there's just a way to express  what an analyst is dealing with and it's funny, I had a lightning talk a couple of months  back at the university and I wanted to do a joke and because in academia we all love  equations, so I created an equation that was sort of a joke and the punchline worked but  afterwards some people approached me and said well it was a joke but actually it's a really  good equation and I showed it to Karsten and he said well it's funny but it's actually  true and so we worked on that and so Karsten will introduce to you the analyst's frustration  equation that we use for the rest of the presentation to get things going.  Yeah and as Christopher said I was really impressed by the equation but then I okay  there's something wrong, no we need to redefine this equation and the idea that what we come out  is quite a simplified equation which can be used to discuss the different problems we have  and also can be used for finding the points where we can optimise the incident handling process.  At the end of the day we would like to calculate the level of frustration and the equation we  come up is okay we have a sum of all the current active incidents, it's just the sum and then we  have this fancy formula and I will try to explain the different terms in this formula. Okay we have  this C, this means complexity. Complexity, the term complexity is used to describe to some extent  how complex is the system we are dealing with. Because we have built as I mentioned in the  beginning we have quite a huge framework for security and also this part which security  is used for which purpose is an important term in the equation. What helps is in order to minimise  the frustration is to have a good documentation and then we have the fraction, we have this A,  automation. That means if there is no automation at all, zero, then you are lost completely. So  that means we need a good level of automation in order to keep the frustration level of the  incident handlers at least to a normal level and then we have the term it's a little bit  difficult to express and I'm searching for a better approach but the idea is to have a number  which expresses how many areas are involved in the problem. If it's a pure IT problem to some  extent it's easy. If it's a pure embedded problem in the car in one issue it's also to some extent  easy to handle but if the problem is introduced in the production into one issue and this issue  is connected to the back end and exchanging data with the back end we have three different parties  involved in the problem and then sending an email to the complete company to the complete brand  means a lot of people and finding the right information it's even more complicated. And I  have an idea for an extension for this formula if we have time at the end I can show you it  is discussing this automation term. Okay but before we proceed just a question so who's working in  IT? Okay that's about half of the room. So who's working in IoT? Okay like two people, three. And  OT? Okay so the OT guys, people have you ever had like an incident or a subject where it wasn't  clear if it's an IT or an OT issue? Okay so and so what we try to express here and that's why I  picked the versus because before you handle the problem at all it's a fight like it's your problem  no it's your problem no it's not my problem it's clearly an IoT problem no it's an OT problem and  so that's a lot of effort goes into that before you even start to handle the problem and that's  why we came up with that and but we have some more details later. And so I start with documentation  so documentation is boring we all know that but it's important and so the problem we have in our  industry and maybe in other industries you have the same problem we don't have that one magic  format for documentation so we have wikis we have the Microsoft products we have email and  if you're not in the automotive industry so Autosa and Vector. So Vector is a company that is kind of  the leader in the automotive industry and so they have all this proprietary stuff and so you can't  approach that and I see a lot of pictures so we the slides will be provided to you you don't have  to take pictures if you don't want to. Yeah and so on the other hand we heard it in an earlier talk  with no it was the keynote where we heard about the badge that didn't work and the excuses and  the supply chain and so we also have this issue so we have a supplier we have contractors we have  subcontractors sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub contractors and it's hard to to find documentation  but now comes the worst part we have something in our company that's core industry that's called  multi-sourcing which is to be fair it's valid to have that so that means don't rely on just one  supplier but it also means you have different software different hardware and different  documentation and again another supply chain that it's hard to follow and so that's sometimes  very frustrating. The next thing we have is automation we skip that because we have that  in the end and Karsten will now describe to you the complexity and security we have. Yeah I mean  we need to go a little bit deeper into this complexity and security topic and first of all  we need to understand what automotive security really means and in order to to get a feeling  about automotive security let's take a picture from a modern car it's just the latest electric  car the Q6 but it's not a promotion event so let's go deeper it's a view inside the car and  this picture shows the so-called domain controllers. Domain controllers are more or less some  kind of high-performance embedded devices which which which handles different domains and domains  for instance could be the infotainment part, could be the the climatization and comfort function  inside the car, could be the communication to the outside world, could be the fancy stuff like  autonomous driving and also we have an ECU for handling all the different data communication  inside the car. So this is some kind of picture let's have a more abstract view on the architecture  and modern cars. We have Ethernet backbone it's a black line over there which connects the different  domain controllers and in this case we have four different AGPs for four different domains and  below these domain controllers in most cases we have quite a lot of so-called sensor and actor  creator ECUs and then we have some some common connectivity module and this connectivity module  handles the communication from the car to the outside world and back from the outside world  to the car and it means some some CE devices, the back ends and even the car-to-car communication.  Modern cars are able to communicate to each other and send some information like okay there's a  problem on the street, there's a pothole over there and then the other cars following the first one  can adapt the driving behavior. And if you go deeper into the ECUs itself we see a lot of complex  software architecture containing different virtualization, different OSs and all the other  stuff and a lot of applications are built around a quite complex web of as I already said suppliers,  sub-suppliers, different software packages and so on and so on. And automotive security means also  to keep to understand the idea of the main slogan of Troopers, make the world  a safer place and automotive security is handling road vehicles and then I have a statement from  Ross Anderson I needed to read, security engineering is about building systems to remain  dependable in the face of malice, error or mischange and in order to understand you call it IoT device,  our IoT device is a car and a car it's up to two tons driving up to 250 kilometers per hour  and you have persons inside the car and if there is a problem then you can kill people.  So and this it's our motivation to in order to make the world a safer place to build safe  and secure cars and this in the modern world it's not that easy as in the previous world.  Okay and so before we go to the next slide one thing that like none of the manufacturers  usually do is to provide you with numbers and we wanted to give you an impression of what we're  dealing with and to provide with numbers and so we can't give you the actual numbers but we decided  to do some ranges but I think it's still impressive to hear about them and so on the left-hand side  we have what we call IoT but it's a vehicle on the right side you see you have IT and I think  IT is easier to grasp but so let's focus on the vehicle for the moment and so within the vehicle  we have several ECUs and so and we say so we have over 250 ECUs  and now the next thing is quite impressive we have over okay it's easy it's not easy to read so  two times ten so we have a lot of streams TCP and UDP and if you look at the protocols we have we  have an overview later on so we have a lot of IP addresses unicast and multicast and we have a lot  of signal types a signal is a form of communication by your transport information and in a vehicle  you have different types so Ethernet is known I guess by all of you we have something like a  canvas we have flex ray we have most and other stuff and so we have more than 30 000 of these  signal types and on the right hand side or it's your left I think yeah on your left side  on our left side your right side we have IT services and so we have several hundred IT services  we have smartphone apps so if you're a customer of the Volkswagen group you know about some of the  apps we have a lot of services we have a lot of we call it entities in that case so we have service  in cloud and that's several thousand and we have more than thousand suppliers and yeah and there's  definitely like a number of suppliers we're not aware of because we're not in controlling or  in that sense so we have to rely on data provided to us  so we can summarize that a vehicle is actually a quite huge network and that has to be monitored  so as you already said inside the car we are using different protocols for communication  that's can can if d flex ray most and some others we have a slide coming showing all the different  protocols inside the car but it's important to understand that we have quite a lot of external  communication it starts with the with the key fob there's also there's some kind of communication  for diagnostic purposes and it's not only connecting a device the device itself the  diagnostic device itself communicates to some back-end systems then we as I already mentioned  a car a modern car is communicating to to other cars as I said for providing the  state of the road and so on and we have quite a lot of communication to the internet  it's just via the mobile network 5g 4g and then we have the the connection via the mobile devices  from the customer via bluetooth and wlan and then the devices itself are connected to the internet  and we have some kind of communication to the infrastructure like traffic lights for instance  and another aspect regarding communication is modern cars are able to communicate to the smart  home and the practical use case could be okay the car the electrical car is used as an energy storage  for the house during the during the day and at the night it gives back some some some energy for  for keeping the light on in the house but the next day if the car is if the car should be used  okay there must be at least some kind of of energy available in the car so what I would like to say  is there are quite a lot of different communication channels from the outside world into the car  and all of them could be used for some attacks especially if the car is connected to the internet  and that means everybody from his home could try to connect to the car and start some kind of  malicious activity and in order to to understand this this complexity we need to understand that  we need crypto algorithms we have different software with all the sub suppliers we have  also the different kind of communication which needs to be somehow processed and somehow handled  inside the different issues and and also handled on the different communication partners connected  to the to the car and let's have a short look on the different protocols we are the different  protocols which are used inside the car we have ethernet based communication we have the the  legacy communication via can can fd and also flexway and uh and most and on top on these  different basic communication protocols we have a lot of different other protocols some of them  more or less standard like ip tls how to tp and so on and so on but we have also some quite a lot of  proprietary automotive protocols which are used for some specific automotive use cases  and the same is valid for the wireless communication which i have shown two slides  before the communication could be based on bluetooth bluetooth low energy is also  available in modern cars for for some for some reasons we have ethernet as a wlan in the sense  and then we have also the the communication via mobile network like 5g 4g and again on top of these  different basic protocols we have a lot of standard protocols and some kind of automotive  specific protocols and the same is valid to some extent for the it world and the backend world  yeah so um the graphics we provide it's just a collection we made uh so it's not 100 complete  i'm sure but just to give you an overview and so i think for it you can relate more  we just try to come up with all the different varieties that are available so we use  virtualization we use cloud technology we use content delivery networks and just give an impression  but so what challenges are we facing on a day-to-day basis like we said we can't provide  you with numbers but so we try to come up with a graph of a percentage um i start with it so at  the moment in it we have a lot of compromised suppliers and if you're reading the news uh  you probably heard from some of them continental was one that's well known uh we have a lot of  vulnerabilities um and the second biggest part we have is malicious activity and this malicious  activity means it can be employees that do stuff like using private usb devices or connect their  device to um to other devices they shouldn't do but that also means misuse of backend systems  from criminals and stuff and so that's what we're dealing at the moment and iot and for the iot  side it's really sorry it's clearly visible that most of the problems we have based on implementation  for some crypto the crypto itself in most cases it's it's fine but implementation could raise  some problems we have some kind of concept problems but most of the problems we see in modern cars are  software implementation problems and my personal opinion that this high number that this high  percentage of of problems is based on the complexity of the supply chain because to be  honest nobody knows what's going on in some devices because there are quite a lot of different software  parts somehow collected on the on the supply chain from different suppliers  with with different experience and in order to get all the different functionalities a modern car must  provide to some extent this approach is understandable but it will raise in the future  quite a lot of problems we have a small part of hardware problems this is obvious obvious because  a car is running and it's also a specific problem for for automotive a normal car is used at least  10 15 20 years and if there is a problem inside some some kind of chips then sometimes these  problems will be detected and will be used by the criminals hopefully we can solve the problem  the hardware problems with some soft software in some cases it's possible some cases okay  there is a problem with the hardware so yep and christopher  we have processes we have documentation we have the vsoc we have uh that we are fulfilling the  iso and to be honest it could be not that hard to handle all these different events we have discussed  so well i'm glad you asked unfortunately no but let's take a closer look and we have to  speed up a little bit to stay in time uh so i created this example and on purpose i picked all  like the most complex scenario that that's possible and we start on the left hand side  so that's the vehicle and just just imagine it's one function in the vehicle that relies  on a back-end system so we go we go down uh so we use hyper hypervisors within the device  which means we have different operating systems on an ecu if you go down the stack we have  communication and for example we use one bus system the canvas to transport the information  we use secoc well that's not well you don't know about this if you're not in the industry but  it's a framework to encrypt communication and then we leave the car via a different ecu that  has access to an lte modem and so at that point we can access the it infrastructure  and the next thing is we have ddos protection so if some of you use for example cloud flare  that's just one example i picked we have this random uh host name and then probably you use  like some sort of load balancing and then you decide to go into the cloud for example  and if you use kubernetes and docker for example uh to implement the one function so  that's everything is required to provide one function keep that in mind and so you saw this  earlier on one slide we just picked the four domains uh cryptography software libraries  suppliers and communication and bad news is if you followed us in the previous slides  that it doesn't mean that each of these is provided by one supplier in the worst case  everything is provided by a different supplier and we end up in this mess and so it's just one  function i mentioned before in the numbers so we have more than 250 services on the back end  and ecu what would you guess an ecu has at least 100 functions so that's very complex and if you  look at a vehicle security operation center we have to monitor this end to end so that's quite  a challenge and so how do we approach this challenge well usually if you have to do something  manually you do it once you do it twice you get annoyed if you have to do it a third time and but  a fourth time you probably write a script to automate it and so we thought about the equation  again so what can we actually do to to lower our frustration and so what we can do is we can  increase automation we can increase documentation and we can try to get rid of the fighting between  the iot and it department um complexity sometimes you can't avoid and security we have to do a lot  of stuff that we are bound to by law so we can't do about that a lot anyway and so that's what we  can do and one thing we tried is to create a model that represents  is the relationship between all of these components and so that far far galaxy away that  you see right now on the screen it just represents the vehicle communication so all these dots it's  half a million notes represent just the vehicle and the relationships between each components  and so what can do with that information is if you have a relationship graph you can do  graph queries and one thing you could do is you can visualize them easier and one example could be  this approach so i can query this model and say can you please please tell me if there's a signal  who's using the signal who's sending the signal and who's kind of related to that signal and can  you please plot it in a graph that i can read you can get something like this and if you're interested  in it's at the bottom that's created with y files check it out it's quite awesome and if you use  python and jupyter notebooks you can use it for free otherwise you have to purchase a license  and so what are the challenges and opportunities with such a model so the challenges of course is  how to create such a model how to keep it updated what data sources can you use so for that model i  i used a lot of time i wasted a lot of time in uh yeah scanning the or processing the proprietary  formats that we have but what are the opportunities so you can add like we said metadata to that  model and for example you can say that's uh that's a safety function that's a safety signal  so if that's compromised it's a it's bad because it's related to self-driving for example  and you can just query that and that means you can do automation um what you can also do is you  could check tcp dumps for example against it uh you can query the overall model and it just takes  a couple of seconds and that saves just a lot of time and you can use it to train ai to some extent  wait a minute wait a minute yeah yeah we had a lot of a lot of discussion regarding this tooling  and this model and i'm quite impressed about the work of christopher but the elephant in the room  is is ai and the question i have i have to christopher is what do you think about ai  does it make any sense to to to use ai in our environment okay good question um so i think a  lot of you are involved with ai at some point so if you just use co-pilot or chat gpt or you have  to to work with it so we just thought well you can't just throw the equation into ai and so  to solve all the problems and and so we think it's a useful addition but the user expectation  i don't know if you're among these users but usually the user expectation is i have some  shitty input i throw it at ai and tada i get the best thing back because ai is a black magic box  this stuff in a worst case scenario and probably you heard of it shit in shit out if you put shit  in you probably get shit out and so i think my personal opinion is ai is useful if you use it  for the best purpose and not just like the solution for everything is ai so how why don't  we just settle for like like input decent data and be happy if you get like that's close to a  unicorn but it's better than nothing better than nothing so and that's kind of a good approach  and so how we think we can leverage its potential is uh i can help us if we have alerts and they  approach and the analyst already processed similar alerts we can train an eye it helps  and one brilliant idea we saw a different place was to throw documentation in so we have a lot  of documents and if you just want to know well listen uh what's the parameter uh of that device  for example and it's written in a word document um and i don't know where this document is and  it takes me a lot of time to find it probably if we use like ai to scan these documents  like a bot uh we can ask and hopefully get the answer short question does the ai also  collect information from emails that's that's a good question um well and automation yeah  like we said automation could be good and so uh we have this uh overview and it's an extension  to the one you saw before and we think on the right hand side where the analysts works happen  it's happening um we can use ai to support the analyst but um i heard some consultants  trying to uh to advocate that ai can replace an analyst and we heard it today and at the keynote  i think uh the human factor is still important and you can't just replace it and and i like  we heard has no doubt and humans have doubt and that's important and so if we improve this uh  the life of an analyst could look like this so we get an alert and it's already calculating some  stuff based on a data model or some impact scores and the analyst is provided with data that the  person can actually work with and not wasting days and weeks collecting the information  and knows how who to approach to get it fixed and fix the problem  and um yeah so that that's i have to say thanks to two of my colleagues from the product security  department uh your cats and kyle fogmar without their help this presentation would not be possible  and then that means we have finished to some extent uh thank you for your attention enjoy  enjoy the lunch afterwards we are open to question if you have any anything then please  raise your question and i promised some extension to to the formula um because we have some time  left as i have seen um the problem with automation is if you have a good automation you can you can  speed up the the work of the analyst but the problem we have is the so-called vendor login  if if you stick on a specific vendor and there and this kind of of automation tooling doesn't  support a new problem but you cannot modify this tooling because you have some kind of different  contracts or there is no no possibility to to script this engine and so on please keep in mind  the vendor login could kill your automation and you are back to a huge problem so that's all  thanks a lot thank you  all right thank you very much any questions  there's one  which kind of data do you have in your model is just about the signals or  also for example which third-party libraries are used to to construct a signal or to consume a signal  that's a very good question so um it's not a complete model because it took a lot of time  to get the small model running but what i used in that was uh all the communication so like  the cpus the cpu cores involved in communication the software but not the software libraries and  versions because uh i needed i need a different data source for that so the data sources i had  which was representing like the communication but still uh i think it's uh it's a time saver  because i was able to for example i wanted to know like what device is communicating with  different device or with ethernet and it took me like 10 seconds to get that information and before  it just took like weeks and if you even i found someone that was having that information  uh so yeah i i'm really willing to extend that model with software versions and to to add  something to this question we are trying to build some kind of database which contains  all the different suppliers and which software is used for which issue it's still not yet available  but if this if this database is available maybe you can use this database to extend your model  and we have to to be fair so there are certain laws that force us to keep a track of the software  versions um yeah but like you said in the earlier slides we have a lot of platforms and a lot of  software and suppliers so it's not always that easy to um get that information and some of the  suppliers and it's fair to save the intellectual property they just provide us with uh already  pre-compiled uh software and we just we can just compile it into our software we don't know what  libraries they used because i'm quite surprised still uh s bombs are still not a thing and i just  don't get it because we have automation we have cacds so why can't we just release a list of the  used um software versions but yeah yeah i suppose it's this web of different suppliers and sub  suppliers and sub suppliers and uh somewhere in this in this chain there's a break and then you  got lost about the library whatever so it's it's a it's a constant constant fight with our suppliers  okay please provide us the information we need in order to fulfill all the different laws we need to  we need to fulfill at the end of the day  um you said you had problems so the battle between it's an iot problem it's an it problem  do you have other problem with uh battle with it's a problem the suppliers the problem with  one supplier with the other supplier with a sub supplier so you have other problems with that yeah  um yeah well what's quite interesting uh some of the suppliers that that have sub suppliers  sometimes don't know what their sub suppliers are doing so it's like the same constellation  we are having but with their own sub suppliers and so they are fighting like it's your fault  no it's your fault no it's your fault not even before they you know get the information to us  and what what i experienced which is very unfortunate if we have a compromised supplier  i know if you have made the same experience um they are by law they are forced to inform us as a  uh customer that they have been hacked and they have to provide this information also to some  government um government authorities yeah thank you uh but the first approach is always denial  and i think it's it's it's fair because the the law department tells them to do that i guess  and so but that's a problem because it's already in the news and it's so yeah you've been in the  news there's nothing there's nothing okay but are you affected no and and so yeah but i can see you  already on on the darknet uh i can already buy your data so are you affected no we're not and  that's kind of a very frustration frustrating conversation and yeah but i think it's yeah  it's how how the law department works denial denial denial and then but i have to to keep up  uh there are there are some suppliers that are very very good at this they informed us in time  they are cooperative so it's not like everyone does it but unfortunately more of the suppliers  are try to denial until the the last minute that's a very unfortunate yeah to be honest i'm  quite long in this business and i have started as you have seen on the first slides 15 years ago  around about and the interaction between the tier one as audio in my case and the tier ones  has changed over the years and even the how to say the quality of the of the exchange of  information between the tier one and this tier one and the om has changed over the year and it  has changed to a lower level and i think this is also a problem and but to some extent i understand  the problem for the if i go in the shoes of the of the tier one because they have they have to  provide us with high quality software with a lot of different functions you mentioned 100 functions  and it's a huge amount of of work which needs to be done and it's quite difficult and on the other  hand they have only a limited set of experts on their own so i think that's the problem to build  software for cars again in order to build safe cars it's a difficult task and not everybody can  do this it's just the easy problem and we have small suppliers and probably you all made this  experience not everyone has the money to afford like a security department and so if there's a  supplier it's fair to assume that it's a very cheap supplier and they're not earning a lot of  money which means they don't have a good security department even if they have a security department  some of them don't even have a like a sisu or anything and so i can't blame them but on the  other hand well then just don't sub supply your supply chain it's i mean you get a lot of money  and uh so do your do your job um yeah long story short at the end of the day you can trust your  own software it's easy yeah and another question it's another question oh yeah  um what attacks do you think are most common or the tech types or distinct attacks in cars  you mean for cars yes  to be honest the problem with car hacks  um is that in most cases you have to look for hacks which return some money  and i think that's that's the because the hackers or the dark side they have also some some some  idea okay we need to earn some money and most hacks are regarding immobilizer functionality  uh enabling uh functions without paying for them for the functions and also adjust for instance  the mileage so in order to uh to to to to get the price high of an old car and i think the  the new challenge is to modify the state of change of the battery in order to to if you  would like to sell a car and then the state of charge is whatever 99 percent it's fine  but in reality the state of charge is whatever 75 percent then increasing this state of charge  is quite it's quite not successful it's quite useful in order to to to earn a higher money  again follow the money and then you find out which attacks are more  probably which which will more probably occur in the field so after markets attacks right for  instance thank you all right any more questions okay the last one  thanks for your talk and insights um i'm from the ot side so my question is how do you handle  the long life cycle of your it devices in in in terms of security patch management  a really difficult question and to be honest uh difficult to answer and  difficult to answer you have two minutes  i have i have a good i have a good answer i think which doesn't put us into a position  where we lose our jobs and give you a an answer that you can work with so i think at the moment  we're at the place the uh the what's it called aeromotive like um boeing and airbus and all  this companies because they already have devices that are long lost long lasting that's the right  word and they already solved some of these problems for example uh how can we sustain like  a build chain for our software if it's based on windows xp and we'd have like windows i don't know  13 or 14 and xp is just not supported anymore and we all have arm chips and xp doesn't run on arm so  that's some of these problems and they solve it quite nicely i think and that's a point where we  aren't right now at the automotive industry and i think we can just learn a lot of what they did  but it's i think it takes a another couple of years well until we figure out that it's something  we have to do yeah i think the problem is is it possible to take over the approach from the  from the avionic industry to the automotive industry and they will try to give a political  answer we are working on this topic and and maybe we can go deeper during lunchtime because it's a  really complicated problem and i also could list a quite huge  list of problems regarding the long lifetime of an of the issues for a car  and maybe we can we can discuss because it's to some extent the ot world and the iot world in  a sense of a in the sense of a car is to some extent similar the main difference is that the  ot world for instance for a factory it's more or less built once and for for a car is built  nine million nine million nine million per year it's a difference but the basic principles are  more or less the same all right thank you very much and as i said they are here on the venue  so feel free to approach them if you want to or if you have any more questions
