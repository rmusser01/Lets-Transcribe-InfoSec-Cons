**Introduction**
- The speakers are from a Taiwanese cybersecurity company, SIGGRAPH, and they aim to tackle complex cybersecurity problems using machine learning techniques.
- The talk focuses on **AD** (Active Directory) **attack path analysis**, highlighting the current issues and proposing a new algorithm for a comprehensive solution.

**Current Issues with AD Attack Path Analysis**
- **Scale of the Problem**: AD environments can be vast, with numerous ACLs (Access Control Lists) and relationships, making it challenging to calculate all possible attack paths.
- **Prioritization Challenge**: Attack paths need to be prioritized, but traditional algorithms like Dijkstra's and A* fall short of providing a complete picture.
- **Visualization and Analysis Tools**: While tools like **At The Lounge**, **Forest Jewelry**, and **Blahung** aid visualization, and **Pincastle**, **Bluhung**, and **Ponghong** help with prioritization, they still have limitations.
- **Defender vs. Hacker Perspective**: Defenders think in lists, while hackers think in graphs. The current tools provide a list-based approach, giving hackers an advantage.

**Proposed Solution: A New Algorithm**
- **Overview**: The proposed algorithm aims to address the issues of scale and prioritization by finding a remediation plan to block all possible attack paths.
- **Graph Representation of AD Network**: The AD network is represented as a graph with nodes (AD objects) and edges (permissions between nodes).
- **Permission Group Analysis**: This step identifies the **control causal graph**, which represents the causal and control relations between nodes.
- **Control and Access Edge Types**: Control edges (e.g., Generic All) and access edges (e.g., Member Of) are transitive, and control is a more powerful permission than access.
- **Identifying Attack Graph**: The attack graph is a subgraph of the original graph containing vulnerabilities. It is identified by analyzing privilege escalation and control relations between clusters of different tiers.
- **Remediation Plan**: The system interactively recommends edge removals to block attack paths, incorporating expert feedback and constraints.
- **Min-Cut Algorithm**: Used to find the minimal set of edge removals to block paths from source to target, considering constraints and unconstrained edges.
- **Constraint Min-Cut Problem**: A variation of Min-Cut to find the minimal set of edge removals blocking only codable source-to-target paths, ignoring uncodable paths.
- **Isomorphic Transformation**: Used to separate paths with codable and uncodable edges, transforming consecutive uncodable edges into a direct link for easier analysis.
- **Prioritized Recommendation**: Scoring is designed to be source-oriented, considering the necessity of an edge for different sources and the risk score of exposing attack paths.

**Case Studies**
- **Case Study 1: Lengthy Attack**: A financial organization with a chaotic AD environment had over 60,000 AD objects and 140,000 edges. The algorithm identified clusters and lengthy attack paths (length 2, 3, or 4) that human analysis missed.
- **Case Study 2: Hierarchical Permission Inheritance**: A transportation company with a complex AD structure had paths overlooked by human analysis due to permission inheritance and GPO (Group Policy Object) settings. The algorithm identified these paths by considering node properties and conditions.
- **Case Study 3: Prioritizing Attack Path Mitigation**: The same company as Case Study 2 had a loop in their AD structure. The algorithm provided recommendations for edge removals based on initial risk, user count, and other factors, which aligned with human analysis but offered a more comprehensive and efficient solution.

**Conclusion and Takeaways**
- **Different Perspectives**: The perspective of the data science team (focused on graphs) and the security research team (focused on misconfigurations and remediation) should be aligned to create effective solutions.
- **Broad View of AD Environment**: It is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the AD environment, as even large enterprises with extensive IT teams can make mistakes.
- **Review AD Regularly**: The speakers shared statistics from their customers, highlighting the significant discrepancy between believed and actual Tier 0 AD accounts and the number of clusters and accounts missed by security experts.
- **Joint Research**: The speakers encouraged attendees to collaborate on similar research, emphasizing the complexity and fun of working on AD-related challenges.
