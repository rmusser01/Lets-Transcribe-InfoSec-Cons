- **Introduction**:
  - Talk by **Balthasar Martin** and **Niklas van Dornick** at **TROOPERS24 IT security conference**
  - Focuses on their **sRLabs deception strategy** and **favorite AD honeypots**
  - Aims to provide effective detection and prevention measures for when attackers gain access to a network
- **The Need for Deception**:
  - **Attackers make mistakes** but still often succeed in compromising target environments
  - **Detection and response** are challenging, especially during **lateral movement and privilege escalation**
  - **SOCs** face issues with **coverage**, **complexity**, **alert volume**, and **staffing**, making it difficult to catch attackers
  - **Honeypots** are proposed as a solution, acting as **internal traps** to detect and alert on malicious activity
- **Honeypot Considerations**:
  - **Discoverability**: Place honeypots where attackers can find them, such as on paths to high-value systems
  - **Appeal**: Make honeypots seem advantageous to attackers, e.g., by suggesting privilege escalation
  - **Authenticity**: Ensure honeypots blend in with the environment, avoiding obvious signs of vulnerability
  - **Simplicity**: Keep honeypots simple and safe, avoiding complex setups that may introduce risks
  - **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: Minimize false positives and ensure traceability to identify the source of alerts
- **Types of Honeypots**:
  - **Honey Network Services**: Normal network services (e.g., SSH, HTTP) that alert on usage or attacks
  - **Honey Tokens**:
    - **Honey Files**: Files (e.g., office documents, PDFs) placed in the network that trigger a DNS request when opened
    - **Authentication Secrets**: Credentials or tokens hidden in code or configurations that trigger an alert when used
  - **Active Directory (AD) Honeypots**: AD objects or accounts that suggest worthwhile attack paths and trigger alerts when exploited
- **AD Honeypot Examples**:
  - **Fake Credentials**: Hide fake credentials for AD accounts in scripts or descriptions, making them appealing through group memberships or naming schemes
  - **Kerberoasting Honeypot**: Set up a user account with an SPN, an outdated password, and RC4 encryption to attract attackers
  - **RDP Privileges Honeypot**: Create a group named to suggest RDP privileges, with all users as members, and local admin rights
- **ADCS Honeypot**:
  - **Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS)** is a **juicy target** for attackers due to its central role and potential for misconfigurations
  - **CertiCeption**: A tool to set up an ADCS honeypot by creating a new CA with a vulnerable ESC1 template and a policy module to deny exploitation
  - **Alerting**: Medium alerts for interactions with the CA, and critical alerts for attempted ESC1 exploitation
  - **Future Improvements**: Support for additional honey templates, placement of honey templates on existing CAs, and enhanced hardening
- **Conclusion**:
  - Honeypots provide **meaningful detections** when attackers bypass initial defenses
  - **Custom-tailored** honeypots that fit the environment and are well-deployed are essential
  - CertiCeption is an effective ADCS honeypot solution, but hardening and error message customization can be explored further
