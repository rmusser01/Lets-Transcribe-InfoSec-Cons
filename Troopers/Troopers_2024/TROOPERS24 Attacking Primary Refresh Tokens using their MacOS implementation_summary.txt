**Introduction**
- Talk by Olaf Hartong and Dirk-jan Mollema at TROOPERS24 IT security conference
- Focus on Primary Refresh Tokens (PRTs) and their implementation on macOS

**Overview of PRTs**
- PRTs facilitate single sign-on for a user's session
- Windows implementation involves Local Security Authority Subsystem (LSS) and Web Account Manager (WAM) broker
- Multiple PRT versions exist, with macOS using API version 3

**PRT Cryptography**
- Windows uses device certificate and transport key for encryption
- macOS uses JSON Web Key specification and generates transport key on-the-fly
- Session key is important for using PRTs and is protected by a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) on Windows

**PRT Acquisition Process**
- macOS PRT acquisition involves OAuth authorization code flow
- Initially, a device-less PRT is obtained, which can be upgraded to a device-bound PRT
- Edge browser and Intune enrollment are two ways to obtain macOS PRTs

**PRT Storage and Usage**
- PRTs are stored in the macOS keychain, protected by user passwords and access controls
- PRT v3 includes a session key, while PRT v4 does not and relies on device certificate for security
- PRTs have a validity period of 90 days

**Attacks and Mitigations**
- Phishing attacks can target PRTs, especially device-less PRTs obtained through OAuth authorization code flow
- Conditional access policies, device registration restrictions, and token lifetime limitations can help mitigate risks
- Microsoft is working on patching vulnerable flows and exploring ways to disallow token reuse

**Conclusion**
- PRT implementations vary across platforms, and Microsoft is addressing security concerns
- Further research and exploration of mitigation strategies are recommended
