- **Introduction**
    - Talk by **Stefan Fleckenstein** of **Mayborn Wolf**, a German software consultancy and development company
    - Focus on **open-source vulnerability management** in **software development** and **cloud environments**
- **Case Studies**
    - **Log4Shell**: Java library vulnerability with wide-ranging exploitation, impacting numerous organizations
    - **Moveit**: Tool with an SQL injection vulnerability, leading to ransomware attacks on major companies
    - **Colombian and Peruvian Airports**: 3 TB of sensitive data exposed in a publicly accessible S3 bucket
    - **Microsoft Employee**: Privileged credentials published in a Git repository, granting access to internal container registry
- **Security Testing Methods**
    - **Code Reviews**: Manual inspection of source code for security vulnerabilities
    - **Functional Tests**: Unit, integration, and system tests to validate functionality, including authentication and input validation
    - **Automation Tests**: Comprehensive testing of the system, often performed for critical systems or major changes
    - **Vulnerability Management**: Tools integrated into CICD pipelines to identify vulnerabilities in code, libraries, and configurations
- **Secure Software Development**
    - **Avoid Vulnerabilities**: Emphasize security by design, protection needs analysis, threat modeling, and risk assessment
    - **Automated Patch Management**: Keep libraries and images updated, use tools like Renovate Bot or Dependabot
    - **Keep it Simple**: Minimize library usage, use small base images, and ensure necessary security measures
    - **Security Champions**: Assign individuals to drive security practices, training, and awareness within teams
- **Vulnerability Scanning**
    - **Dependencies**: SCA tools like Dependency Check, Dependency Tracker, Scribe, and Trivy
    - **Application Code**: SAST tools for specific programming languages (e.g., Bandit for Python, ASLint for JavaScript)
    - **Cloud Configuration**: Tools like SMGrab, Chekhov, Kix, and Trivy for infrastructure-as-code
    - **Secrets**: Gitleaks for detecting secrets in source code repositories
- **Curated List of Vulnerability Scanners**
    - Standardized integration of scanners with **GitLab CI templates** and **GitHub Actions** for uniform usage
    - **Configuration File** specifies scan type, target, report name, and upload to vulnerability management tool
- **Vulnerability Management Tools**
    - **Dependency Track**: OWASP flagship project, specialized for SCA and license checks
    - **Defect Dojo**: OWASP flagship project, complex UI, supports various scanners and on-prem tools
    - **SecObserve**: Open-source tool with focus on software development and cloud, supports multiple scanners, issue tracking, notifications, and integrations
- **SecObserve Demonstration**
    - **Dashboard**: Overview of observations, severities, and status, with graphs and timelines
    - **Products**: List of observations from different scanners, with severity, status, description, and vulnerability information
    - **Assessment and Remediation**: Eliminate false positives, accept risks, and fix vulnerabilities, with automatic resolution upon successful scans
- **Effectiveness of Open-Source Scanners**
    - Master thesis comparison showed low false positives and accurate severity assessments, especially for critical and high vulnerabilities
    - Commercial products offer advantages in developer support, user interface, and potential AI-driven vulnerability detection and resolution
- **Conclusion**
    - Following the presented steps can lead to more secure projects and a safer software ecosystem
    - Open-source vulnerability management tools and scanners are effective and accessible options for organizations
