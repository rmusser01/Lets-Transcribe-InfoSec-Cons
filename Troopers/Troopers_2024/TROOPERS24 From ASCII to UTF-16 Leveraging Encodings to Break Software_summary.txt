- **Introduction**:
    - Character encodings are often seen as boring and annoying.
    - However, they can have security implications, as demonstrated by a live example.
    - Stefan Schiller is a vulnerability researcher who discovers zero-day vulnerabilities.

- **What is Encoding?**:
    - Encoding is the process of mapping different types of data (images, sound, text) to computer-readable formats (ones and zeros).
    - This includes mapping characters to bytes using encoding schemes like ASCII.

- **The Evolution of Character Encodings**:
    - Early character encodings were manufacturer-specific and incompatible.
    - ASCII emerged as a standard but lacked support for non-English languages.
    - ISO 8859 extended ASCII to cover more languages, but compatibility issues remained.
    - Unicode was introduced as a universal character set, mapping characters to code points.
    - UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 are common encodings for Unicode, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

- **Security Issues with Character Encodings**:
    - Overlong UTF-8 sequences: using unnecessary leading zeros to represent characters, which can be exploited for path traversal attacks.
    - Invalid byte sequences: handling invalid sequences differently can lead to vulnerabilities, as seen in Joomla's XSS vulnerability.
    - String length calculation: some programming languages define string length based on code units, not characters, which can affect security.
    - Encoding differentials: mismatches between encoding and decoding can be exploited, especially with ISO 2022 JP encoding and auto-detection in browsers.

- **Breaking HTML Context with ISO 2022 JP**:
    - By inserting escape sequences, an attacker can switch between ASCII and JISX0208 character sets.
    - This can be used to break HTML context, allowing injection of JavaScript code.

- **Negating Backslash Escaping with ISO 2022 JP**:
    - JSX-02-01, a variation of ISO 2022 JP, maps backslash and double-quote characters differently.
    - By switching to this character set, an attacker can negate backslash escaping and inject JavaScript code.

- **Conclusion**:
    - Character encodings are prevalent and can impact security.
    - UTF-8 is the most common encoding, but legacy encodings are still supported.
    - Exploring encoding-related vulnerabilities can lead to interesting discoveries.
    - Stefan encourages further exploration and provides resources for learning more.
