**Introduction:**
- **Thomas Sermpinis (a.k.a Cr0wTom)** and **Pavel Khunt** present their tool, V2GEvil, and their journey in creating it.

**Overview of the Automotive Industry's Cybersecurity State:**
- The automotive industry's need for connectivity and technological advancements has led to the emergence of new attack vectors.
- The focus is on the **emerging industry of electric and hybrid vehicles**, which has introduced **standardized charging ports, protocols, and data**, expanding the attack surface.

**Vehicle Architecture and Charging Methods:**
- Modern vehicles consist of interconnected **Electronic Control Units (ECUs)**, responsible for various functionalities, now including an **externally accessible charging port**.
- There are several **charging methods**, including conductive, wireless, battery swaps, and bidirectional charging.

**Charging Standards and Communication:**
- The **Combined Charging Standard (CCS)** aims for a unified system, but different regions have varying standards.
- Charging involves both **AC and DC chargers**, with DC chargers used for faster charging and AC for overnight charging.
- **Data exchange** occurs during charging, including payment details, voltage requirements, and more, utilizing various communication protocols.

**High-Level Communication (HLC):**
- HLC is triggered by **low-level communication**, which involves physical signaling and voltage measurements.
- HLC is necessary for **DC charging** to exchange specific information and enhance user experience, e.g., plug-and-charge functionality.
- HLC is defined in **ISO 15118**, which includes protocols for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) communication and data link layer specifications.

**V2G Communication Flow:**
- HLC involves establishing an **IP-based connection** and exchanging various messages, including SDP requests/responses and V2G EXI messages.
- V2G messages consist of a **header and payload**, with the payload type indicating the message content.

**V2G Message Structure:**
- V2G messages include **SDP requests/responses** and **EXI-encoded V2G messages**.
- The **SDP request** indicates requested security and transport protocol, while the **response** provides IP address, port, and security/transport protocol details.
- Following this exchange, V2G messages are exchanged, focusing on **EXI-encoded V2G messages** for application layer protocol handshake and application layer messages.

**Testing Environment and Tool Implementation:**
- The **DLAN Green PHY EvalBoard** with a Green PHY module was used for testing, allowing data transfer over Ethernet bridged to power line communication.
- The **Qualcomm A7000 chip** and **Green PHY firmware** provided the data link layer, while the **Joint Operating System for EV chargers (Joseph)** was referenced for higher OSI layers.
- The **V2GEvil tool** is designed to be modular, with the **V2GTP module** implementing V2G transfer protocol parsing and decoding.

**Tool Demonstration:**
- The **sniffer module** captures and decodes V2G communication between reference implementations of EVCC and SECC.
- The **enumerator module** captures information offered by EVCC, including supported application protocols, TLS version, cipher suites, etc.
- The **fuzzer module** tests the robustness of EVCC implementation by sending invalid values for parameters, causing message processing failures.
- The tool is not perfect, and enhancements are planned, including full control over the charging communication, fuzzing of PDU structure, and discovery of manufacturer-specific messages.

**Conclusion and Q&A:**
- Communication in EVs has room for improvement, and the lack of open-source tools prompted the development of V2GEvil.
- Questions addressed TLS certificate management, tool capabilities, Qualcomm chipset behavior, and potential vulnerabilities in charging stations.
