## Introduction
- Presented by Andy Robbins and Jonas BÃ¼low Knudsen
- Talk covers ADCS attack path identification, analysis, and execution using BloodHound
- Also covers visualizing and auditing the ADCS LDAP hierarchy, and practical remediation strategies

## ADCS Attack Path Identification, Analysis, and Execution
### Escalation 1
- Allows a principle in Active Directory to impersonate any other principle
- Alice can ask the Enterprise CA to issue a certificate valid for authentication, with the user principal name (UPN) of another user (e.g., Bob, a domain admin) in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field
- The CA will check security descriptors to determine if Alice has the necessary permissions
- If allowed, the CA will issue the certificate to Alice, which she can then use to get a TGT as Bob, effectively impersonating him
- This privilege escalation primitive is common but can be labor-intensive and error-prone to identify manually
- BloodHound can be used to find paths to this escalation privilege

### Escalation 3
- Abuse of enrollment agent permissions
- Alice can request an enrollment agent certificate, which allows her to enroll on behalf of other principals
- She can then request a certificate as Bob and impersonate him
- BloodHound can identify and abuse this attack path as well

### Escalation 5
- LDAP object manipulation
- Exploits the interconnection between ADCS and Active Directory, and the default LDAP hierarchy
- Extremely complex with many variations, making it hard to find and identify
- Can enable escalation from domain admin to enterprise admin due to behavior with the configuration naming context and replication in the forest
- Can emerge from a combination of existing privileges and missing configurations
- BloodHound can help identify and visualize the relationships between objects involved in Escalation 5

### Escalation 13
- Abuse of OID group links
- Alice has enrollment rights on a custom certificate template with an issuance policy field set to an Enterprise Admin's policy
- When she authenticates using this certificate, she gets a Kerberos ticket with membership in the Enterprise Admins group, despite not being a member
- BloodHound can identify this escalation path and provide details on the relevant objects and permissions

## Visualizing and Auditing the ADCS LDAP Hierarchy
- BloodHound provides visualizations and queries to simplify the auditing process and help create better reports
- Pre-built queries can identify principles with ADCS escalation privileges, enrollment rights on published ESC1 certificate templates, CA administrators and managers, etc.
- The PKI hierarchy view can be used to audit permissions on relevant objects and identify potential issues
- The API documentation provides information on automating these queries and processes

## Practical Remediation Strategies
- Focus on identifying and fixing issues before they can be exploited
- GT queries can be used to find non-tier 0 principles with ADCS escalation edges and generic all permissions on ADCS objects
- Escalation 1 can be mitigated by limiting enrollment rights on certificate templates to tier 0 principles or removing EQs that allow for domain authentication
- Enrollment agent restrictions can be used to grant specific permissions to help desk or IT support staff while preventing escalation to tier 0 accounts
- Care should be taken when following vendor guides to avoid unintended consequences and security risks
