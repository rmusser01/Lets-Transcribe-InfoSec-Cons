**Vulnerability Discovery**

- Conventional approaches focus on specific targets or platforms.
- **Scaling security research**: Leveraging unconventional data sources.
- **Examples**: Forgotten cloud assets and leaked secrets.
- **Incentives and solutions**: Discussing ecosystem issues.

**Cloud Computing and Security**

- **Cloud computing**: Shared infrastructure like servers and websites.
- **Access management**: Using access keys in AWS and tokens in Google Cloud.
- **Risks**: Tokens can be used by unauthorized users if leaked.

**Cloud Resources and DNS Records**

- **Cloud resource types**: Primitive (dedicated IPs) vs. shared (serverless applications).
- **Dangling DNS records**: Risks when DNS records point to unused resources.
- **Attacker opportunities**: Phishing, malware distribution, and cross-site scripting.

**Past Approaches and Limitations**

- **Dangling resources**: Enumerating cloud IP pools using DNS data.
- **Leaked secrets**: Focused on specific targets, limited scope.
- **Security mindset**: Traditional approaches focus on specific targets rather than scale.

**Security at Scale**

- **New approach**: Start with vulnerabilities, not targets.
- **Diverse data sources**: Essential for finding vulnerabilities broadly.
- **Virus scanning platforms**: Potential for finding leaked secrets.

**Implementation and Techniques**

- **Using serverless computing**: Cost-effective for scanning large volumes.
- **Bypassing modern deterrents**: Overcoming cloud provider mitigations.
- **Enumerating IP addresses**: Techniques for Google Cloud and AWS.

**Impact and Findings**

- **IP enumeration**: Over 2 million unique IPs discovered.
- **Domain capture**: 60,000 FQDNs and 54,000 unique domains found.
- **Secret discovery**: Over 15,000 validated secrets across various platforms.

**Challenges and Remediation**

- **Provider responsibility**: Importance of addressing insecure defaults.
- **Secret revocation**: Need for automatic mechanisms to revoke exposed keys.
- **Industry-wide solutions**: Necessary for DNS and cloud resource management.

**Conclusion**

- **Security at scale mindset**: Crucial for protecting organizations beyond limited scopes.
- **Future research**: Emphasizing unconventional data sources for broader vulnerability discovery.
- **Provider collaboration**: Essential for addressing and mitigating these vulnerabilities effectively.
