**Introduction to Apple's USB-C Controller Hacking**
- Apple switched iPhone 15 & iPhone 15 Pro to **USB-C** with a proprietary controller, **ACE3**
- ACE3 is a microcontroller handling **USB stack** and internal busses
- Access to **JTAG**, **UART**, and **SPMI** was achieved through ACE3
- Previous ACE2 controllers in MacBooks were vulnerable to **SWD** exploits

**Challenges with ACE3 Security Enhancements**
- **Firmware updates** are personalized, and debug interfaces are disabled
- External flash validation complicates firmware analysis
- **Reverse-engineering**, **RF side-channel analysis**, and **fault-injection** used for code-execution

**Reverse-Engineering Techniques**
- **Vendor Defined Messages (VDM)** can change pin configurations on USB-C connectors
- **Asahi Linux team** developed tools to send VDM commands
- **Central Scrutinizer**: a serial adapter for sending commands and getting UART shell access

**Experimentation with iPhone 15**
- Difficulty in achieving **serial** access due to USB-C complications
- Successfully obtained **serial console** on iPhone 15 using Central Scrutinizer

**Exploring ACE3 Capabilities**
- ACE3 can run as a full **USB device**
- Potential for **jailbreak persistence** if compromised
- **SWD access** allows for firmware updates, but debug ports are initially disabled

**Fault Injection and Side-Channel Analysis**
- **Electromagnetic Fault Injection (EMFI)** used for glitching ACE3
- **EM side-channel** analysis employed to determine glitch timing
- Used **hackRF** for EM recording and **chip select line** as a trigger

**Successful Exploitation and Implications**
- Achieved code execution on ACE3
- Dumped full firmware for further analysis
- Highlighted the potential for **security research** on overlooked Apple components

**Tools and Resources**
- **Tamarin Kernel**: An OpenOCD driver for debugging ACE2 and peripherals
- **ACE Tool**: Communicates with ACE via **4CC commands**
- **USB-C Firmware Flasher**: Handles firmware updates, but vulnerable to persistence attacks

**Conclusion and Future Work**
- **Persistence** and dedication required for successful reverse-engineering
- Encouragement for further research on ACE3 and other proprietary chips
- Availability of cheaper tools like **Pico MP** for conducting similar attacks
