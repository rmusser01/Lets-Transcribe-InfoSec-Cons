**Research Overview**
- **Downgrade Attacks**: Act of reverting software to an older, vulnerable version.
- **BlackLotus**: Downgraded boot manager to bypass **Secure Boot**.
- **Windows Updates Flaw**: Allows control over updates and crafting downgrades, bypassing verification.

**Downgrade Attack Methodology**
- **Goals**: Fully undetectable, invisible to updates, persistent, and irreversible.
- **Windows Updates Exploitation**: Abuse of **Trusted Installer** and **Administrator** roles not being a security boundary.
- **Action List Manipulation**: Control over update actions for downgrades.

**Key Vulnerabilities**
- **VBS Bypass**: Disabling VBS by replacing **Secure Kernel** or **Hypervisor** files.
- **Credential Guard and PPL**: Bypassed using downgrades and UEFI lock circumvention.
- **Hyper-V Downgrade**: Targeted **Hypervisor** for privilege escalation.

**Demonstration Outcomes**
- **Kernel Downgrade**: Achieved **Kernel Code Execution**.
- **Credential Guard Bypass**: Extracted credentials despite **PPL** and **UEFI locks**.
- **Hypervisor Downgrade**: Proved vulnerability across the virtualization stack.

**Security Implications**
- **Vulnerability Exposure**: Old and patched vulnerabilities become exploitable.
- **Security Boundary Concerns**: Questions on the effectiveness of current protections.
- **Industry Awareness**: Need for heightened awareness and mitigation strategies.

**Future Considerations**
- **Linux and Other OS**: Potential vulnerabilities in virtualization security.
- **Design Evaluation**: Importance of examining design flaws that allow downgrades.
- **Further Research**: Encouraged exploration into other vulnerable components.
