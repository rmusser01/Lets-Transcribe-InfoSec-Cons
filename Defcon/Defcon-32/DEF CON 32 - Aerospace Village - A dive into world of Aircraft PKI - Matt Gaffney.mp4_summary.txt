**Introduction to Aircraft PKI**

- **Matt Gaffney**: Principal engineer at United Airlines and village lead at Aerospace Village.
- **Presentation Focus**: Shallow dive into aircraft PKI with caveats and simplifications.

**Importance of Aircraft PKI**

- **Field Loadable Software (FLS)**: Critical in modern aircraft for updating firmware and features.
- **Verification of Authenticity**: Required by regulation for all FLS from external sources.
- **Supplier Agnostic Approach**: Discussing industry challenges without covering all specifics.

**Use Cases and Methods**

- **Use Cases**: Includes updating firmware, maintaining systems, and control surfaces.
- **Methods A, B, and C**: Various methods for signing and verifying FLS.
  - **Method A**: Involves smart cards and OCSP responses.
  - **Method B**: Utilizes HSMs and simpler structures.
  - **Method C**: Not common in commercial aircraft, designed for long-term FLS validity.

**ATA Spec 42**

- **Focus**: Emphasis on identity verification and dual controls.
- **PKI Subscribers**: Must authenticate using smart card-based hardware certificates.
- **Audit and Controls**: Includes strong authentication mechanisms and audit of activities.

**Post-Quantum Challenges**

- **Future Threats**: Quantum computing may break current encryption methods.
- **Aircraft Lifespan**: Typically 30 years, making changes complex and costly.
- **Preparation**: Inventory of PKI use cases and identifying suitable algorithms.

**Conclusion**

- **Call to Action**: Encouragement to discuss post-quantum PKI and share insights.
