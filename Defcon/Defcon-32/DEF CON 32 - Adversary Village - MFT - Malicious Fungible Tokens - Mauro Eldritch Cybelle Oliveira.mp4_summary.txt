**Introduction**
- Welcome to the talk on **Malicious Fungible Tokens (MFTs)**
- Presenters: **Mauro** and **Yvelle**

**Presenters' Background**
- Yvelle: From **Sao Paulo, Brazil**, works in **Cyber Threat Intelligence**, interested in **malware research**
- Mauro: **Uruguayan-Argentinian hacker**, leader of **Bits of Quetzal team**, focused on **Web3 threats**

**Talk Overview**
- Focus on using **NFTs as immortal command and control servers**
- Not promoting NFTs or crypto investments
- Continuation of the previous talk **"Everything is a C2"**

**NFT Basics**
- **NFTs**: Information stored on a **blockchain**
- Can store images **on-chain** or **off-chain** on decentralized platforms

**C2 Servers**
- **Command and Control (C2) servers**: Used for sending and receiving malware information
- Issues with traditional servers: can be **banned** or **blacklisted**

**Blockchain and Decentralization**
- **Blockchain**: Permanent and unchangeable
- **NFT storage**: Can be on blockchain or decentralized platforms like **IPFS**

**Interplanetary File System (IPFS)**
- Decentralized platform, similar to a **torrent**
- Files are distributed among nodes and managed by **Filecoin**

**Experiment Setup**
- **Leopoldo** the dog, four NFTs with different attack vectors: **Initial Access Marker**, **Ransom Retriever**, **Threat Actor**, **Golden Locker**
- **Malicious NFTs**: Coded in **Ruby** using **Sinatra**

**Exploitation Techniques**
- **Threat Actor**: Uses **Base64** and **Route 13** encoding for commands
- **Golden Locker**: Encodes commands in **Base64**

**Technical Execution**
- **OpenSea API**: Used for traffic during attacks
- **Steganography**: Messages hidden within images using **LSB method**

**Challenges and Observations**
- Difficulty in taking down content due to decentralization
- Possible **abuses** through untraceable content
- **Forensic challenges**: Traffic appears to come from **OpenSea**

**Security Implications**
- **Immortal C2 servers**: Cheap to create, resilient against takedowns
- **Potential for scams**: Highlighted dangers of decentralization

**Conclusion**
- Recap of the importance of understanding and mitigating threats from **NFT-based C2 servers**
- Invitation to visit **La Villa Hacker**, a new village for Spanish and Portuguese talks

**Q&A and Closing Remarks**
- Tool for creating NFTs released
- Encouragement to explore and modify the tool
