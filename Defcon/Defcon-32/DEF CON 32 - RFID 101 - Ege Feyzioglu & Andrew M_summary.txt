**RFID Basics**
- **RFID** is used in everyday scenarios like accessing buildings, transit systems, and payment methods.
- The technology involves a **transformer** effect where the card and reader communicate via a magnetic field.
- The readerâ€™s coil creates a magnetic field that induces a current in the card, powering a chip to respond with its ID.

**Security Vulnerabilities**
- **No encryption**: RFID systems can be easily intercepted as they rely on magnetic fields.
- **Cloning**: It's possible to clone badges and fobs due to their simplistic communication protocol.
- **Brute force**: Short keyspaces allow for easy brute-forcing of IDs.

**Encryption Solutions**
- **Pre-shared keys**: Ensure secure communication by requiring both the reader and card to have a pre-agreed key.
- **Challenge and response**: A method where the card and reader prove they know the key without revealing it.
- High-frequency systems (13.56 MHz) often use **encryption** to secure communication.

**Demonstration with Flipper Zero**
- The **Flipper Zero** is a tool used to demonstrate RFID cloning, showing how easily information can be copied from one badge to another.
- The device can also brute force RFID systems by running through a short dictionary of possible codes.

**Best Practices for Security**
- Treat RFID cards and fobs like keys; if lost, they should be deactivated immediately.
- Upgrade systems to ensure **proper encryption** of transmitted secrets.
- Implement **tamper detection** on readers to prevent unauthorized access.

**Preventive Measures and Tools**
- Use **RFID-blocking** holders to prevent unauthorized reading.
- Opt for systems that require a handshake before data exchange.

**Conclusion**
- RFID technology, although convenient, is not inherently secure and should be managed with the same care as traditional security methods.
- Engage in continuous security measures and stay informed about evolving RFID technologies and potential vulnerabilities.
