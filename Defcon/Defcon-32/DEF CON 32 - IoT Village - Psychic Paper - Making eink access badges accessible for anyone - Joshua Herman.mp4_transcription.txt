 Hi. Sorry for the set-up issues.
5.00s - 10.00s |  This is my talk about psychic paper.
10.00s - 15.00s |  It's how to use e-ink displays and also e-paper
15.00s - 20.00s |  displays to fake the front
20.00s - 25.00s |  of identification badges and also discussion about
25.00s - 31.57s |  the two or three e-ink systems
31.57s - 36.57s |  that are pre-made from suppliers and how they have lax security
36.57s - 41.57s |  and unusual sign-up. My handler is ZitterBBGong.
41.57s - 49.74s |  I'm a frequent of the DEF CON Discord. A lot more about who I am.
49.74s - 54.74s |  I have 11 years of experience in the software industry.
54.74s - 59.74s |  This is a hobby project and this is not related to my employer.
59.74s - 64.74s |  I've actually had to add that to my presentations because people
64.74s - 69.74s |  think that they're too advanced to actually not be related to my hobby.
69.74s - 74.74s |  So what is this talk about? This talk is about the application
74.74s - 81.21s |  of two to three color e-ink displays
81.21s - 86.21s |  and also a design prototype of a five color e-ink display
86.21s - 91.21s |  that would be much more
91.21s - 96.21s |  effective in red teaming and or physical red teaming
96.21s - 101.21s |  and social engineering. Anecdotally, I talked
101.21s - 106.21s |  to the person at DEF CON and they were able to replicate someone's
106.21s - 111.21s |  image by taking a, by looking for a high resolution picture,
111.21s - 116.21s |  copy and pasting it into an image editor and then printing it out.
116.21s - 121.21s |  This system, while having a lower resolution,
121.21s - 126.21s |  could be done in real time and also
126.21s - 131.21s |  it could be replaced real time too and combined
131.21s - 136.21s |  with RFID knowledge that has been done in many DEF CON talks,
136.21s - 141.21s |  you could basically clone an entire employee ID badge
141.21s - 146.21s |  or physical access badge that uses RFID
146.21s - 151.21s |  and or other technologies like
151.21s - 156.21s |  MIFID and so forth. So first we're going to go
156.21s - 161.21s |  through three color e-ink displays. These can be found
161.21s - 166.21s |  on Amazon and Alibaba. They are very easily sourced. They are much
166.21s - 171.21s |  durable than the research prototype I have. They are reprogrammable
171.21s - 176.21s |  and they have a weird way that you have to program them.
176.21s - 181.21s |  So this is the nice pictures from Amazon that they put
181.21s - 186.21s |  and on the upper right side,
186.21s - 191.21s |  that's the real thing. A good idea
191.21s - 196.21s |  to understand the difference between e-ink, e-paper and
196.21s - 201.21s |  traditional display technologies or not really traditional but
201.21s - 206.21s |  light emissive versus non-light emissive. So non-light
206.21s - 211.21s |  emissive technologies require power and they require
211.21s - 216.21s |  the emission of light.
216.21s - 221.21s |  OLED, LCD and so forth.
221.21s - 226.21s |  By that nature, the obvious emission of light requires
226.21s - 231.21s |  thermodynamically, you need a power source.
231.21s - 236.21s |  On e-ink and or e-paper, e-ink is trademarked.
236.21s - 242.49s |  It's an electromechanical device. What does that mean?
242.49s - 247.49s |  Electromechanical devices are devices that literally
247.49s - 252.49s |  just move by an electric charge and
252.49s - 257.49s |  then stop. Because they stop, they can
257.49s - 262.49s |  not acquire a power source
262.49s - 267.49s |  after programming. I talked
267.49s - 272.49s |  with someone in a previous talk I gave at
272.49s - 277.49s |  another conference and they told me that they had a
277.49s - 282.49s |  12-year-old e-ink or e-paper device with
282.49s - 287.49s |  the image for that long and there was no image degradation.
287.49s - 295.24s |  But why I call this three color is that technically
295.24s - 300.24s |  there are three colors. There is white, red and black.
300.24s - 305.24s |  Now the other difference between e-paper and other
305.24s - 310.24s |  light emissive such as LED and OLED is that because this is
310.24s - 315.24s |  electromechanical, you technically have three colors and it's not RGB.
315.24s - 320.24s |  It's white-ish, black and red.
320.24s - 325.24s |  You can see this and also if you had a Kindle, it's pretty obvious that
325.24s - 330.24s |  white is not white-ish also. Even in the picture, you can see what two white is
330.24s - 340.07s |  and white. So that's a big thing to consider.
340.07s - 345.07s |  A demo was on Amazon about just a two color.
345.07s - 365.91s |  As you can see the housing too. That will be
365.91s - 377.73s |  important in the five color prototype. So you could basically
377.73s - 382.73s |  remake this especially if they use only a QR code to authenticate people
382.73s - 387.73s |  by just getting the data off the QR code and then using the e-ink
387.73s - 396.63s |  or e-paper programmer and then scanning it.
396.63s - 401.63s |  Some types of the suppliers are
401.63s - 406.63s |  the software is made by Hippo Inc.
406.63s - 411.63s |  The APK must be downloaded from
411.63s - 416.63s |  Hong Kong IP addresses or you have to be there.
416.63s - 421.63s |  There's the active version that is also $100.
421.63s - 426.63s |  The non-active version is around $40. The active version
426.63s - 431.63s |  has a button and a USB-C possibly to reprogram.
431.63s - 436.63s |  But it's pretty obvious that they have to have some kind of battery to do that.
436.63s - 441.63s |  Both need phones to connect to.
441.63s - 446.63s |  This one uses an iOS device but I'm only going to show the Android one.
446.63s - 451.63s |  So this is more an expanded on how to reprogram those three color.
451.63s - 456.63s |  You need a Hong Kong IP address. Use a VPN too.
456.63s - 461.63s |  You must silo the APK. You still must be using
461.63s - 466.63s |  a Hong Kong IP address to download the APK. Also they have a link.
466.63s - 471.63s |  You must create the login still using the VPN.
471.63s - 476.63s |  It has this weird setup. You set up an email. You set up a password.
476.63s - 481.63s |  And then you have a pseudo two-factor that's emailed to you.
481.63s - 491.14s |  Then you can upload the badge. The cards have
491.14s - 496.14s |  125 kHz NFC on it.
496.14s - 501.14s |  The important part is aluminum tape or
501.14s - 506.14s |  to remove it if you want to use any other RFID technology.
506.14s - 511.14s |  So you don't want to confuse the RFID or
511.14s - 516.14s |  NFC sensor.
516.14s - 521.14s |  The passive one also uses NFC to reprogram.
521.14s - 526.14s |  I suggest putting on the back or just put it in your pocket.
526.14s - 532.94s |  Now I'm going to go into more of the prototype design I made.
532.94s - 537.94s |  So this is the more interesting part. It was not in the talk description.
537.94s - 542.94s |  But I mean why not?
542.94s - 547.94s |  So as you can see on the right there is
547.94s - 552.94s |  the ePaper ESP32 circuit board.
552.94s - 557.94s |  It then connects to the ePaper device.
557.94s - 564.22s |  You can see that the fidelity is much better. The white is still off-white.
564.22s - 569.22s |  But it's much more high resolution.
569.22s - 574.22s |  Also the purple part is the bezel.
574.22s - 579.22s |  This is the display connector. The middle part is a shim
579.22s - 584.22s |  that they do where it takes one connector and adds it to another.
584.22s - 589.22s |  The middle part is part of the programmer.
589.22s - 594.22s |  There is also a Raspberry Pi
594.22s - 599.22s |  hat.
599.22s - 604.22s |  If I were to redo it I would have done it that way.
604.22s - 610.72s |  This programmer is either
610.72s - 615.72s |  has unreliable behavior or when I've unplugged and
615.72s - 620.72s |  plugged the orange part it breaks my programming. So I have to do more research on that.
620.72s - 625.72s |  But you could also do it as a one and done engagement anyways.
625.72s - 630.72s |  Since the person who I talked about doing the physical engagement
630.72s - 635.72s |  when he printed it out, he said he used it for the full engagement and nobody noticed for a month.
635.72s - 640.72s |  So this is a more high fidelity nobody looks at.
640.72s - 645.72s |  But you can also do active programming by going in from one
645.72s - 650.72s |  security, taking a picture about somebody else's picture with higher
650.72s - 658.57s |  level clearance, reprogramming and so forth.
658.57s - 663.57s |  This is the most important part and most technical part of it.
663.57s - 668.57s |  I had to find a wallet that would cover the bezel.
668.57s - 673.57s |  Do you see this bezel?
673.57s - 693.29s |  I did find a wallet. This is on Amazon.
693.29s - 698.29s |  This is an ad for the wallet.
698.29s - 703.29s |  I don't know if you can see this well but it covers the bezel.
703.29s - 708.29s |  Number two is your friend is also called
708.29s - 713.29s |  double sided tape. Why does that matter?
713.29s - 718.29s |  You want this to generally be in place so that the bezel
718.29s - 723.29s |  doesn't fall out.
723.29s - 728.29s |  Because people might notice the purple part and also you don't want it falled out.
728.29s - 733.29s |  I would also recommend to use that so it doesn't fall out either.
733.29s - 740.94s |  Although it's pretty tight if you don't cut anything.
740.94s - 745.94s |  But yeah, double sided tape is really important.
745.94s - 750.94s |  This is in inches and
750.94s - 755.94s |  the display prototype or the display I'm using
755.94s - 764.88s |  is in metric, so millimeters.
764.88s - 769.88s |  The affected display that you have to program is 640x400.
769.88s - 774.88s |  There are five colors in display which increases the fidelity.
774.88s - 779.88s |  The RFID and NFC component can be separate.
779.88s - 784.88s |  There are two ways that you can integrate it. One, cut the back of the display.
784.88s - 789.88s |  I mean back of the wallet.
789.88s - 794.88s |  Paste the RFID device or anything inside.
794.88s - 799.88s |  Remove the RFID shielding because this one is shielding. I couldn't find one without shielding.
799.88s - 804.88s |  And put it inside. Another way would be to take a picture of the back of the wallet.
804.88s - 809.88s |  Make a sticker on Sticker Mule.
809.88s - 814.88s |  And then use double sided tape on the RFID device and then put the sticker on top of that.
814.88s - 823.88s |  So this is sort of a basic summary of the steps to do.
823.88s - 833.33s |  You could also make your own lanyard.
833.33s - 838.33s |  I usually think to make a
838.33s - 843.33s |  less prototype or more like a release version
843.33s - 849.67s |  would be for me to replicate this white design
849.67s - 854.67s |  and 3D print it and then add
854.67s - 861.21s |  Bluetooth programming or something else.
861.21s - 868.42s |  The NFC holder on the back.
868.42s - 873.42s |  So the brand for the wallet I'm using is Cavaleo.
873.42s - 878.42s |  It's a police style badge.
878.42s - 883.42s |  I don't recommend using the other part because that's
883.42s - 888.42s |  very illegal.
888.42s - 893.42s |  You can see the resolution of this e-paper device.
893.42s - 898.42s |  It's wave share and then the HID card.
898.42s - 903.42s |  You can either get these cards from
903.42s - 908.42s |  online. You could get it by buying a Proxmark.
908.42s - 913.42s |  You could get one by forgetting to return your hotel badges.
913.42s - 918.42s |  It depends. There are two general frequencies.
918.42s - 923.42s |  125 kilohertz and 415 megahertz.
923.42s - 928.42s |  But it really depends on the situation on what you're doing.
928.42s - 933.42s |  And programming is annoying.
933.42s - 938.42s |  ESP32 driver board. You can use a phone for the three color.
938.42s - 943.42s |  The five color also has the ability
943.42s - 948.42s |  to do programming online.
948.42s - 953.42s |  It's sort of weird. The ESP32 has two ways to do online programming.
953.42s - 958.42s |  One is a Bluetooth one that I couldn't get working.
958.42s - 963.42s |  Two is the Wi-Fi one. The Wi-Fi one is extremely finicky.
963.42s - 968.42s |  If you look in console and if you do it, it crashes.
968.42s - 973.42s |  It says post does not work. You have to do it in a specific order.
973.42s - 978.42s |  If you do it in the wrong order, you could have real problems.
978.42s - 983.42s |  I would overwrite the driver board. This is why I don't want to use this driver board anymore.
983.42s - 988.42s |  There are many upsides for the
988.42s - 995.62s |  Wi-Fi usage. There was a DEF CON talk
995.62s - 1000.62s |  where they did a real time badge cloning of RFID
1000.62s - 1005.62s |  and they used Raspberry Pis, which means that you could combine
1005.62s - 1010.62s |  this into that talk and
1010.62s - 1015.62s |  then you wouldn't even need this driver board.
1015.62s - 1020.62s |  WaveShare also has a wiki. It's okay,
1020.62s - 1025.62s |  but there are no alternative suppliers to this.
1025.62s - 1030.62s |  This is the best solution I've seen.
1030.62s - 1035.62s |  4.01 inches is really hard to find.
1035.62s - 1040.62s |  The purpose of these E-Ink, or why they even exist,
1040.62s - 1045.62s |  if you go to a Kohl's
1045.62s - 1052.48s |  or a Best Buy,
1052.48s - 1057.48s |  they have a lot of prices on the walls and they use it to automatically
1057.48s - 1063.98s |  change it and possibly rip you off more.
1063.98s - 1068.98s |  This is more about the driver board. It physically attaches,
1068.98s - 1073.98s |  and it supports Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Once you do programming,
1073.98s - 1078.98s |  it's not needed. It could be a one and done
1078.98s - 1083.98s |  engagement, really, considering how it is.
1083.98s - 1088.98s |  It's slightly inexpensive. It's below $40.
1088.98s - 1099.42s |  How I recommend it is
1099.42s - 1104.42s |  you should be able to write it to the e-paper using
1104.42s - 1109.42s |  the Wi-Fi, but the Wi-Fi setup has to be programmed
1109.42s - 1114.42s |  specifically as a static IP. I thought of doing a demo
1114.42s - 1119.42s |  like that, but it would require too much overhead and also Wi-Fi is spotty
1119.42s - 1124.42s |  and I'd have to bring some kind of Wi-Fi divider.
1124.42s - 1129.42s |  Possibly if you're going to do this yourself to add a metal plate, they're not expensive to do.
1129.42s - 1134.42s |  Just to make the wallet more rigid
1134.42s - 1139.42s |  because you can crack this quite easily by dropping it.
1139.42s - 1144.42s |  So the aluminum would at least make it more rigid.
1144.42s - 1150.99s |  Believe the padding in the wallet gives you enough.
1150.99s - 1155.99s |  The programmer is like a poxmark. You plug in the serial port. There's a lot of tutorials to do it.
1155.99s - 1160.99s |  You should read the badge from one and then write.
1160.99s - 1165.99s |  You could put it behind the prototype badge. That's a more advanced thing than emulating,
1165.99s - 1170.99s |  but the top three would be. By putting in
1170.99s - 1175.99s |  behind the prototyping badges, you put in the programmed RFID behind it
1175.99s - 1180.99s |  depending on how good you want to make it.
1180.99s - 1204.39s |  Any questions?
1204.39s - 1209.39s |  I believe it's white, red,
1209.39s - 1219.86s |  black, yellow, orange.
1219.86s - 1226.43s |  It's the spinner.
1226.43s - 1243.34s |  The bill of materials if you were to redo this would be
1243.34s - 1249.74s |  the e-paper display is around $30 or $40.
1249.74s - 1254.74s |  The wallet is another $30.
1254.74s - 1259.74s |  The programmer is another $20.
1259.74s - 1269.77s |  So around $200.
1269.77s - 1274.77s |  It depends on how you're doing the RFID reprogramming.
1274.77s - 1279.77s |  You can use a poxmark.
1279.77s - 1286.37s |  On the other hand, if you're doing a physical one, you can just take somebody's
1286.37s - 1299.59s |  and use the double-sided tape and the other sticker I alluded to.
1299.59s - 1318.10s |  I can't hear what you say. Software side of what?
1318.10s - 1324.38s |  It's an Arduino Scratch that is given to you by Waveshare.
1324.38s - 1336.51s |  Do not use Arduino IDE.
1336.51s - 1341.51s |  Use the previous.
1341.51s - 1346.51s |  The Arduino IDE I've had problems. Using a Mac has problems.
1346.51s - 1351.51s |  Using a Windows machine was the only way I could get it to work.
1351.51s - 1358.21s |  When I program it, even though it will verify
1358.21s - 1374.34s |  and it shows up in tools, and here's where I was alluding to,
1374.34s - 1379.34s |  you can see how janky this is.
1379.34s - 1384.34s |  You have to program the SSD password, static IP, gateway, subnet, DNS
1384.34s - 1389.34s |  to connect to Wi-Fi.
1389.34s - 1394.34s |  What's funny is they also program the whole HTML website here.
1394.34s - 1401.52s |  That's how they get the ESP-2 to work.
1401.52s - 1406.52s |  It's not a server, it's a client.
1406.52s - 1413.31s |  Server.h is this website serving.
1413.31s - 1418.31s |  Server.h means to connect to a server.
1418.31s - 1425.10s |  I don't know why there's script A, B, C, and D.
1425.10s - 1448.09s |  There's a Bluetooth one too. I couldn't get that one to work.
1448.09s - 1453.09s |  You can see, it's probably hard to see,
1453.09s - 1458.09s |  it says you have to also use the board ESP-2 dev module.
1458.09s - 1463.09s |  That means you have to be connected to the Internet
1463.09s - 1468.09s |  to get the module parameters or setup
1468.09s - 1473.09s |  because Arduino does not come with that default.
1473.09s - 1478.09s |  What I meant by the Arduino version, this is 1.8.29.
1478.09s - 1483.09s |  Arduino forks themselves
1483.09s - 1488.09s |  where they have an Arduino IDE
1488.09s - 1493.09s |  and an Arduino regular system
1493.09s - 1498.09s |  or programming system, not IDE.
1498.09s - 1503.09s |  When I tried programming with the traditional IDE,
1503.09s - 1534.23s |  I had lots of problems to the point where I just reverted.
1534.23s - 1539.23s |  This is the three-color dispatch being programmed.
1539.23s - 1556.71s |  This is where there was an issue when I was programming it.
1556.71s - 1561.71s |  This is me tapping it properly.
1561.71s - 1566.71s |  You can see the interface.
1566.71s - 1574.66s |  This is my face when you have only three colors.
1574.66s - 1579.66s |  This is the logo I made that is in the tool.
1579.66s - 1584.66s |  I'm working on trying to make a tool that's integrated
1584.66s - 1591.03s |  to the point where it will try to do the USB programming directly
1591.03s - 1596.03s |  hosted by the Raspberry Pi hat
1596.03s - 1601.03s |  to try to integrate a lot of the difficulties I had
1601.03s - 1608.85s |  with the traditional programmers.
1608.85s - 1613.85s |  .
