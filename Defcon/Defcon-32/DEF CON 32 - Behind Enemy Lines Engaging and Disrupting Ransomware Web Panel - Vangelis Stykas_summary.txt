**Presentation Overview**
- **Title**: Behind Enemy Lines: Engaging and Disrupting Ransomware Web Panels
- **Speaker**: Vangelis Stykas
- **Event**: DEF CON 32
- **Focus**: Strategies to infiltrate and disrupt ransomware web panels and gather intelligence

**Key Concepts**
- **Ransomware**: Type of malicious software that threatens to publish or block access to data until a ransom is paid
- **Command and Control (C2) Centers**: Used by ransomware groups to manage operations
- **Cyber Offense**: Proactive strategies to disrupt ransomware operations

**Ransomware Operations**
- **Common Targets**: Hospitals, critical infrastructure, and various sectors
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Includes tech teams, negotiators, customer support, and money launderers
- **Ransomware Models**:
  - **Lone Wolves**: Individual operators
  - **Initial Access Brokers**: Specialize in gaining initial access to systems
  - **Ransomware as a Service (RaaS)**: Subscription-based model offering ransomware tools

**Methodologies for Disruption**
- **Infiltration Techniques**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in web panels and APIs
- **Data Gathering**: Unauthorized access to gather intelligence and disrupt operations
- **Tools Used**:
  - **Dirsearch**, **FFUF**, **Burpsuite**: For penetration testing
  - **Tor**: Anonymity in research
  - **Anyrun**: Malware analysis
  - **DigitalOcean**: Hosting for testing

**Ethical Considerations**
- **Vigilantism**: Balancing proactive offense with ethical boundaries
- **Collaboration with CTI Companies**: Need for better information sharing

**Case Studies**

- **Group 2: Black Hat/Alpha V**:
  - **Approach**: Continuous scanning led to extraction of commands
  - **Outcome**: Prevented ransomware attacks on four companies
- **Group 3: Everest**:
  - **Approach**: Exploited outdated WordPress vulnerabilities
  - **Outcome**: Gained administrative access
- **Group 4: Black Angels**:
  - **Approach**: Identified configuration errors
  - **Outcome**: Exposed sensitive information

**Conclusion**
- **Success in Disruption**: Despite challenges, significant disruptions were achieved
- **Call for Action**: Encouragement for CTI companies to collaborate more openly
- **Personal Motivation**: Desire to challenge ransomware groups and improve cybersecurity practices
