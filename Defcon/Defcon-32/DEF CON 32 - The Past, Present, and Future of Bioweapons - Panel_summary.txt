**Introduction to Bioweapons**

- Biological warfare is not a recent invention; it dates back to ancient times.
- Importance of understanding historical examples to gain insights into the current and future landscape of **bioweapons**.
- Our future optimism is linked to fostering **transparency** and **creativity** within the global community.
- Technological advancements and rapid innovation play a crucial role in defense against emerging threats.
- Human ingenuity is key to overcoming technological shortcomings and failures of imagination.

**Historical Context of Bioweapons**

- Example from 1348: Siege of Kaffa where plague-infested corpses were used as bioweapons.
- The attack led to the spread of the **Black Plague** in Europe, causing millions of deaths.
- Early bioweapons involved using biological agents like plague victims or infested bodies.
- **Definition of a bioweapon**: A virus, bacteria, or toxic compound used as a weapon.

**Development of Bioweapons Over Time**

- **Germ theory of disease** by Louis Pasteur changed the understanding of biological warfare.
- World War I saw bioweapons used to affect agriculture and livestock.
- Geneva Convention outlawed the use of biological weapons but allowed research and stockpiling.
- World War II and Cold War saw further developments and stockpiling of bioweapons.
- Bioweapons Convention in the 1970s aimed to prevent stockpiling and research but lacked enforcement.

**Present-Day Challenges and Considerations**
