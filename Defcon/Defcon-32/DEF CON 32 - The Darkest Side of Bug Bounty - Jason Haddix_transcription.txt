 Thank you, thank you so much.
8.51s - 10.51s |  My name is Jason.
10.51s - 12.51s |  I'm going to try to keep my energy up for this talk.
12.51s - 14.51s |  I usually do when I speak,
14.51s - 16.51s |  but I have a little bit of a
16.51s - 18.51s |  situation going on right now at home.
18.51s - 20.51s |  My wife's in the ER.
20.51s - 22.51s |  My kids are watching, my other kids,
22.51s - 24.51s |  and I've done four talks this week already.
24.51s - 26.51s |  So I'm going to try to keep it up, but if I'm a little bit
26.51s - 28.51s |  less than super, super
28.51s - 30.51s |  Jason Haddix, I'm sorry.
30.51s - 32.51s |  But I'm going to do my best.
32.51s - 34.51s |  This talk I've wanted to do for a long time.
34.51s - 36.51s |  It's called The Dark Side of Bug Bounty.
36.51s - 38.51s |  And it is a collection
38.51s - 40.51s |  of notes around
40.51s - 42.51s |  the kind of worst possible
42.51s - 44.51s |  scenarios that can happen in bug bounty programs.
44.51s - 46.51s |  So we did a little survey
46.51s - 48.51s |  originally about what you guys do, but
48.51s - 50.51s |  there are
50.51s - 52.51s |  four primary types of people, or three primary
52.51s - 54.51s |  types of people in the
54.51s - 56.51s |  equation of bug bounty. So there are
56.51s - 58.51s |  bug bounty hunters, people who find
58.51s - 60.51s |  vulnerabilities. How many bug bounty hunters do we have
60.51s - 62.51s |  in here? Okay,
62.51s - 64.51s |  good amount. There are
64.51s - 66.51s |  program owners, so they work
66.51s - 68.51s |  at the company that runs the bug bounty program.
68.51s - 70.51s |  Who are those people in the audience?
70.51s - 72.51s |  You could be triage, you could be program management,
72.51s - 74.51s |  you could be vulnerability management, stuff like
74.51s - 76.51s |  that. And then you have people that work on
76.51s - 78.51s |  the platform that do the triage, or any platform
78.51s - 80.51s |  people in here, like Bug Crowd, SYNAC,
80.51s - 82.51s |  HackerOne, Integrity, things like that.
82.51s - 84.51s |  Do we have any of those people in here?
84.51s - 86.51s |  You wouldn't want to raise your hand for this one.
86.51s - 88.51s |  I'm just kidding.
88.51s - 90.51s |  Okay, so why am I uniquely
90.51s - 92.51s |  situated to give this talk?
92.51s - 94.51s |  Because I've been
94.51s - 96.51s |  on all sides of the equation. So
96.51s - 98.51s |  I am ranked number
98.51s - 100.51s |  57th overall on Bug
100.51s - 102.51s |  Crowd as a hacker. I have been
102.51s - 104.51s |  hacking on Bug Crowd for a long, long time.
104.51s - 106.51s |  Recently I've started to build up
106.51s - 108.51s |  my rep on Integrity as well. I've
108.51s - 110.51s |  done HackerOne live events, I've done
110.51s - 112.51s |  Bug Crowd live events. I'm pretty much
112.51s - 114.51s |  well versed in the hacker area
114.51s - 116.51s |  of bug bounties.
116.51s - 118.51s |  I have also been on
118.51s - 120.51s |  the platform side. I worked at
120.51s - 122.51s |  Bug Crowd for six years.
122.51s - 124.51s |  Four of them as
124.51s - 126.51s |  the head of operations,
126.51s - 128.51s |  meaning I managed the triage team globally.
128.51s - 130.51s |  So that means I got to see
130.51s - 132.51s |  every bug bounty program that they ran.
132.51s - 134.51s |  Through my tenure I saw
134.51s - 136.51s |  tens of thousands of bugs filter
136.51s - 138.51s |  through the queue at Bug Crowd and managed
138.51s - 140.51s |  my teams to triage them.
140.51s - 142.51s |  I've
142.51s - 144.51s |  also known triagers that have gone
144.51s - 146.51s |  to other platforms and stay in touch with them.
146.51s - 148.51s |  Some of this stuff is not my direct experience,
148.51s - 150.51s |  it's notes from other people on other platforms.
150.51s - 152.51s |  I don't mention any platforms in this.
152.51s - 154.51s |  I think that all the platforms have
154.51s - 156.51s |  a lot of the same problems that I'm going
156.51s - 158.51s |  to talk about in these slides.
158.51s - 160.51s |  And then I've also been a program owner.
160.51s - 162.51s |  I've run a multinational company
162.51s - 164.51s |  as a CISO and so I had to purchase
164.51s - 166.51s |  Bug Bounty as a part of
166.51s - 168.51s |  a security program, as part of a vulnerability management
168.51s - 170.51s |  program and assessment program.
170.51s - 172.51s |  So we had to build a scope
172.51s - 174.51s |  and deal with running
174.51s - 176.51s |  a program just like everybody else does.
176.51s - 178.51s |  So I've got to see this
178.51s - 180.51s |  ecosystem grow from its
180.51s - 182.51s |  infancy to its adulthood
182.51s - 184.51s |  and got to see every skeleton in the
184.51s - 186.51s |  closet basically. So we're going to talk about some of the
186.51s - 188.51s |  notes I have. They're a little bit scattered but
188.51s - 190.51s |  hopefully they're fun to talk about.
190.51s - 192.51s |  The first thing we're going to talk about
192.51s - 194.51s |  is some of the really crappy things
194.51s - 196.51s |  that are going on right now in the
196.51s - 198.51s |  bug bounty industry in general.
198.51s - 200.51s |  And this is kind of
200.51s - 202.51s |  goes back to a thing that me and my friend
202.51s - 204.51s |  talk about is that
204.51s - 206.51s |  a lot of people have pivoted from
206.51s - 208.51s |  celebrating the creativity
208.51s - 210.51s |  of the bug bounty hunters who are
210.51s - 212.51s |  submitting really cool vulnerabilities
212.51s - 214.51s |  and scaling your security program in a way
214.51s - 216.51s |  that you really couldn't do before.
216.51s - 218.51s |  You had to really consult with pen testers and stuff like that
218.51s - 220.51s |  before. Now they're starting to
220.51s - 222.51s |  exploit them a little bit. And so we're going to talk about
222.51s - 224.51s |  two things that I think are kind of shitty
224.51s - 226.51s |  in that way. You guys don't mind if I drop
226.51s - 228.51s |  a curse word every once in a while, right?
228.51s - 230.51s |  Alright.
230.51s - 232.51s |  The first thing I'm going to talk about is AI.
232.51s - 234.51s |  So right now at all of the platforms
234.51s - 236.51s |  what they're doing is
236.51s - 238.51s |  they're taking bug bounty hunters
238.51s - 240.51s |  attack traffic and they're training
240.51s - 242.51s |  AI models on this attack traffic.
242.51s - 244.51s |  And what they're doing is they're building services out of it.
244.51s - 246.51s |  They're building threat intel feeds for
246.51s - 248.51s |  program owners to understand
248.51s - 250.51s |  what type of attacks exist
250.51s - 252.51s |  in hardware hacking, web hacking, all kinds
252.51s - 254.51s |  of different hackings. And
254.51s - 256.51s |  then they're also building vulnerability scanners
256.51s - 258.51s |  out of training off of these models
258.51s - 260.51s |  on this attack traffic.
260.51s - 262.51s |  And what's happening is that they're basically stealing
262.51s - 264.51s |  attack data and research data from
264.51s - 266.51s |  researchers and they give no payments to
266.51s - 268.51s |  the bug hunters for this.
268.51s - 270.51s |  We get nothing for it basically.
270.51s - 272.51s |  So for instance
272.51s - 274.51s |  I find a zero day tomorrow
274.51s - 276.51s |  on SAP
276.51s - 278.51s |  or something like that. And I submit it to a bug bounty
278.51s - 280.51s |  platform. They will automatically train on it
280.51s - 282.51s |  with the attack string I used. And then
282.51s - 284.51s |  they'll either turn it into a threat feed or a scanner
284.51s - 286.51s |  give the benefit to all of their
286.51s - 288.51s |  customers but never give me any
288.51s - 290.51s |  kickback on that vulnerability. So I only get
290.51s - 292.51s |  paid once and maybe they found hundreds of
292.51s - 294.51s |  thousands of instances of that vulnerability.
294.51s - 296.51s |  So this is a really shitty part of the
296.51s - 298.51s |  industry and I'm hoping that this changes.
298.51s - 300.51s |  I'm hoping that we can move towards a model
300.51s - 302.51s |  where
302.51s - 304.51s |  if that happened and I didn't have
304.51s - 306.51s |  access to a program where
306.51s - 308.51s |  I couldn't submit that SAP vulnerability
308.51s - 310.51s |  that they would automatically be able to tell
310.51s - 312.51s |  me and say hey we did locate
312.51s - 314.51s |  this on 35 other customers
314.51s - 316.51s |  here's a 20% kickback
316.51s - 318.51s |  because it was your vulnerability research.
318.51s - 320.51s |  So this is how I'm hoping this changes
320.51s - 322.51s |  but right now there's no indication that that's going to happen
322.51s - 324.51s |  and they will continue stealing
324.51s - 329.07s |  from bug hunters.
329.07s - 331.07s |  Another one is cloud
331.07s - 333.07s |  WAFs. So
333.07s - 335.07s |  in the industry obviously you have
335.07s - 337.07s |  companies that are cloud based
337.07s - 339.07s |  web application firewalls or cloud based
339.07s - 341.07s |  protection suites. These
341.07s - 343.07s |  products are ubiquitous to
343.07s - 345.07s |  every application these days and
345.07s - 347.07s |  all of your internet connected infrastructure.
347.07s - 349.07s |  These are things like Akamai and CloudFlare
349.07s - 351.07s |  and
351.07s - 353.07s |  some of the other firewall vendors have these type of things.
353.07s - 355.07s |  So
355.07s - 357.07s |  a couple weeks ago
357.07s - 359.07s |  a friend of mine was streaming
359.07s - 361.07s |  and he's streaming on Twitch
361.07s - 363.07s |  and he's streaming hacking stuff
363.07s - 365.07s |  and we're talking
365.07s - 367.07s |  in Twitch chat because we all like to support
367.07s - 369.07s |  each other and he's like a content creator slash
369.07s - 371.07s |  streamer and we get to talking
371.07s - 373.07s |  and we're talking about a
373.07s - 375.07s |  new AI tool that we're going to build
375.07s - 377.07s |  and live in chat a representative
377.07s - 379.07s |  from one of these
379.07s - 381.07s |  companies basically says
381.07s - 383.07s |  oh that's really cool I'm going to build a defense against
383.07s - 385.07s |  that and take it. So then
385.07s - 387.07s |  we end up talking to a whole bunch of
387.07s - 389.07s |  researchers around
389.07s - 391.07s |  kind of around the scene
391.07s - 393.07s |  and we compare some notes
393.07s - 395.07s |  and some conversations we've had
395.07s - 397.07s |  and it turns out that there's
397.07s - 399.07s |  a lot of kind of nefarious
399.07s - 401.07s |  stuff going on. So
401.07s - 403.07s |  if you're a bug bounty hunter and you submit
403.07s - 405.07s |  attack traffic sometimes
405.07s - 407.07s |  the platforms ask you to put a web header in there
407.07s - 409.07s |  so they can recognize it's you.
409.07s - 411.07s |  Now anybody between your home
411.07s - 413.07s |  machine and the client you're attacking
413.07s - 415.07s |  and the bug bounty hunting
415.07s - 417.07s |  company when you submit the report
417.07s - 419.07s |  can identify you by that header. It's a unique
419.07s - 421.07s |  header. It's usually
421.07s - 423.07s |  like hacker one something or whatever
423.07s - 425.07s |  you know. Now we didn't
425.07s - 427.07s |  know until very recently is that
427.07s - 429.07s |  Akamai, CloudFlare
429.07s - 431.07s |  is like this. Do any of you work for Akamai or CloudFlare?
433.07s - 435.07s |  They're monitoring
435.07s - 437.07s |  about a list of
437.07s - 439.07s |  250 of the best bug bounty hunters
439.07s - 441.07s |  in the world. They're monitoring
441.07s - 443.07s |  our traffic, our attack patterns, what we're
443.07s - 445.07s |  doing and they're trying to build just in time
445.07s - 447.07s |  protections for the type of attacks we're doing
447.07s - 449.07s |  and sell it as part of their rule set
449.07s - 451.07s |  without giving us any credit.
451.07s - 453.07s |  They're also
453.07s - 455.07s |  sending representatives to watch our streams
455.07s - 457.07s |  monitor our
457.07s - 459.07s |  GitHub commits, go to our talks
459.07s - 461.07s |  that's why I asked if anybody was in here
461.07s - 463.07s |  and monitor our chats
463.07s - 465.07s |  on the
465.07s - 467.07s |  open bug bounty discords and slacks.
467.07s - 469.07s |  Then they
469.07s - 471.07s |  take this data and they share it with each other
471.07s - 473.07s |  so they have agreements
473.07s - 475.07s |  with each other to share attack data so that they can
475.07s - 477.07s |  do analytics on it. And in some of the
477.07s - 479.07s |  worst cases we've had, bug bounty
479.07s - 481.07s |  hunters have released tools
481.07s - 483.07s |  that were really, really good tools in the offensive
483.07s - 485.07s |  security space and these
485.07s - 487.07s |  vendors have gone out and strong armed
487.07s - 489.07s |  young impressionable researchers and
489.07s - 491.07s |  forced them to take these tools offline
491.07s - 493.07s |  or at least pressured them to do so.
493.07s - 495.07s |  So this is the kind of stuff we deal
495.07s - 497.07s |  with. Now the solutions here
497.07s - 499.07s |  are just better
499.07s - 501.07s |  communication and a technical
501.07s - 503.07s |  solution to bug bounty hunting.
503.07s - 505.07s |  I'm a big believer that
505.07s - 507.07s |  that's top 250
507.07s - 509.07s |  people that they feel like they need to monitor
509.07s - 511.07s |  for that kind of stuff.
511.07s - 513.07s |  First of all, they just get in our way. They're
513.07s - 515.07s |  free by obscurity. It doesn't take
515.07s - 517.07s |  me long to bypass one of those cloud
517.07s - 519.07s |  based wafts. It's just kind of an annoyance.
519.07s - 521.07s |  But I don't feel good about
521.07s - 523.07s |  the data sharing between companies.
523.07s - 525.07s |  And so if they want to just
525.07s - 527.07s |  put some research time rather
527.07s - 529.07s |  into doing all this against us and just
529.07s - 531.07s |  make a global header that allows
531.07s - 533.07s |  a background checked bug bounty
533.07s - 535.07s |  researcher who is well known in the community
535.07s - 537.07s |  to bypass all this stuff
537.07s - 539.07s |  and they don't have to monitor and I'll just work with them.
539.07s - 541.07s |  I'd much rather have a community that worked like that
541.07s - 543.07s |  than one that works like this.
543.07s - 547.86s |  Okay. Let's talk about
547.86s - 549.86s |  triage in bug bounty.
549.86s - 554.86s |  Okay. So if you've ever run a bug bounty
554.86s - 556.86s |  how budget works
556.86s - 558.86s |  in a bug bounty is and how you purchase
558.86s - 560.86s |  a bug bounty is usually you go into
560.86s - 562.86s |  the bug bounty platform and you're like, hey, I want
562.86s - 564.86s |  to negotiate. I want to buy bug bounty.
564.86s - 566.86s |  And what you're buying when you buy bug bounty
566.86s - 568.86s |  is you're buying the platform
568.86s - 570.86s |  to ingest the bugs usually.
570.86s - 572.86s |  And then you're buying maybe triage
572.86s - 574.86s |  associated to that. You're getting triage
574.86s - 576.86s |  from the platform.
576.86s - 578.86s |  And then you're also paying
578.86s - 580.86s |  your reward pool
580.86s - 582.86s |  in the initial payment.
582.86s - 584.86s |  And so it's usually structured as a one year deal
584.86s - 586.86s |  or a three year deal.
586.86s - 588.86s |  You get a price break if you go
588.86s - 590.86s |  for a three year deal with the platforms.
590.86s - 592.86s |  Now the reason that
592.86s - 594.86s |  you pay for all of these things
594.86s - 596.86s |  in one lump sum is
596.86s - 598.86s |  usually because you're trying to skirt your
598.86s - 600.86s |  finance group at your company.
600.86s - 602.86s |  So it's a
602.86s - 604.86s |  financial
604.86s - 606.86s |  trap to
606.86s - 608.86s |  pay bug bounty hunters out
608.86s - 610.86s |  from your company. It requires a whole
610.86s - 612.86s |  bunch of tax paperwork for each bug
612.86s - 614.86s |  that you pay out individually. This is why
614.86s - 616.86s |  people use the platforms a lot.
616.86s - 618.86s |  So what you
618.86s - 620.86s |  do is you pay for the platform, you pay for the triage
620.86s - 622.86s |  and then you pay for your first
622.86s - 624.86s |  year of bug bounty rewards all as
624.86s - 626.86s |  one lump sum to the platform.
626.86s - 628.86s |  And then they hold an escrow
628.86s - 630.86s |  the money for the payouts to the hackers.
630.86s - 632.86s |  And so that's called the reward pool.
632.86s - 634.86s |  And
634.86s - 636.86s |  that way it's just one lump
636.86s - 638.86s |  sum that your finance team sees and
638.86s - 640.86s |  you don't have to do the taxes. BugCrowd has
640.86s - 642.86s |  to do the taxes or HackerOne has to do
642.86s - 644.86s |  the taxes for each bug
644.86s - 646.86s |  payout which is a tremendous
646.86s - 648.86s |  benefit to your financial teams.
648.86s - 650.86s |  And so that's kind of how budgeting
650.86s - 652.86s |  works and how payment works for a program.
652.86s - 656.27s |  Now
656.27s - 658.27s |  a very common situation
658.27s - 660.27s |  in the worst part of bug bounty
660.27s - 662.27s |  is that you start a bug
662.27s - 664.27s |  bounty and you haven't had enough security testing
664.27s - 666.27s |  yet or you just didn't
666.27s - 668.27s |  know that you had a whole bunch of assets out there
668.27s - 670.27s |  or you just mis
670.27s - 672.27s |  kind of judged
672.27s - 674.27s |  how bad you were going to get crushed
674.27s - 676.27s |  by the bug bounty hunters.
676.27s - 678.27s |  And this happens so often.
678.27s - 680.27s |  So you open a public program
680.27s - 682.27s |  and you get hundreds
682.27s - 684.27s |  of submissions
684.27s - 686.27s |  like hundreds, like 800 to
686.27s - 688.27s |  maybe even 1,200. I've seen programs
688.27s - 690.27s |  I've saw a program once get
690.27s - 692.27s |  8,000 submissions in a week
692.27s - 694.27s |  from the bug bounty hunter community.
694.27s - 696.27s |  Now obviously your triagers at the
696.27s - 698.27s |  platform are there to lessen that
698.27s - 700.27s |  load but it's still a lot of load
700.27s - 702.27s |  on your team and
702.27s - 704.27s |  you've made a contract and
704.27s - 706.27s |  you've opened a program and all these bugs come
706.27s - 708.27s |  rushing in at once immediately
708.27s - 710.27s |  your scope or
710.27s - 712.27s |  immediately your budget, it gets exhausted
712.27s - 714.27s |  like it's gone within a day
714.27s - 716.27s |  like a lot of people grossly underestimate
716.27s - 718.27s |  how much it's going to take to run
718.27s - 720.27s |  a public bug bounty. A lot of people
720.27s - 722.27s |  go in thinking I'm going to spend
722.27s - 724.27s |  the first year maybe 80k
724.27s - 726.27s |  on bug bounty payouts.
726.27s - 728.27s |  The reality is if you have a large scale program
728.27s - 730.27s |  you're going to spend somewhere between
730.27s - 732.27s |  300 to 500k.
732.27s - 734.27s |  If you keep it open and you don't
734.27s - 736.27s |  pause it and you don't do some of the shitty things I'm about
736.27s - 738.27s |  to tell you that some people do.
738.27s - 740.27s |  So what happens
740.27s - 742.27s |  in this situation with the worst customers
742.27s - 744.27s |  is they get
744.27s - 746.27s |  really scared about the bug bounty and
746.27s - 748.27s |  their budget getting exhausted
748.27s - 750.27s |  and they get really conservative with payouts.
750.27s - 752.27s |  And so what they do
752.27s - 754.27s |  is they take the contextual
754.27s - 756.27s |  ratings of CVSS
756.27s - 758.27s |  which most of the platforms use
758.27s - 760.27s |  to rate the impact of a bug
760.27s - 762.27s |  and they start downgrading little edge cases
762.27s - 764.27s |  out of them. I'll highlight the specific ones
764.27s - 766.27s |  that they downgrade.
766.27s - 768.27s |  But the customers will downgrade these to make the bug
768.27s - 770.27s |  fall to a lower payout level so that
770.27s - 772.27s |  they can have more remaining budget
772.27s - 774.27s |  on the other side.
774.27s - 776.27s |  The other way that they try to protect against
776.27s - 778.27s |  budget exhaustion when they get crushed by a
778.27s - 780.27s |  bug bounty program
780.27s - 782.27s |  is they try to group bugs together.
782.27s - 784.27s |  So instead of individually paying out every
784.27s - 786.27s |  XSS that they find, they'll be
786.27s - 788.27s |  like, oh, we're just going to
788.27s - 790.27s |  pay out the first few and we're going to say
790.27s - 792.27s |  that holistically XSS is a problem
792.27s - 794.27s |  and we're not going to pay out XSS anymore.
794.27s - 796.27s |  And they're going to say, oh yeah,
796.27s - 798.27s |  it's because of a framework
798.27s - 800.27s |  level problem. And once we fix the framework
800.27s - 802.27s |  level problem, all XSS will be fixed,
802.27s - 804.27s |  which is a bunch of bullshit.
804.27s - 806.27s |  But they do this very often.
806.27s - 808.27s |  Sometimes even at the
808.27s - 810.27s |  suggestion of the platforms, which is kind
810.27s - 816.66s |  of nefarious.
816.66s - 818.66s |  So in triage, clients get
818.66s - 820.66s |  in the loop with the triage after
820.66s - 822.66s |  the platform does.
822.66s - 824.66s |  So the platform triage usually helps
824.66s - 826.66s |  rewrite the bug,
826.66s - 828.66s |  decide if the bug
828.66s - 830.66s |  is valid, and then
830.66s - 835.54s |  passes it on to the customer.
835.54s - 837.54s |  When customers get in the
837.54s - 839.54s |  loop,
839.54s - 841.54s |  stuff can get real crazy.
841.54s - 843.54s |  So if a customer is not
843.54s - 845.54s |  technical enough,
845.54s - 847.54s |  just on accident, they can
847.54s - 849.54s |  mess up the scoring of the impact of a vulnerability.
849.54s - 851.54s |  And most often,
851.54s - 853.54s |  either the nefarious downgrade of a vulnerability
853.54s - 855.54s |  or the accidental downgrade
855.54s - 857.54s |  of a vulnerability, sorry about the typo,
857.54s - 859.54s |  is in four sections in CBSS4.
859.54s - 861.54s |  It's the access requirements,
861.54s - 863.54s |  attack requirements, user interaction
863.54s - 865.54s |  requirements, and privilege requirements
865.54s - 867.54s |  in CBSS4.
867.54s - 869.54s |  These are all dials that you turn on CBSS4.
869.54s - 871.54s |  And whether you
871.54s - 873.54s |  say that you need
873.54s - 875.54s |  to have network access or you need to have
875.54s - 877.54s |  authenticated access or something like that,
877.54s - 879.54s |  the bug severity goes up and down.
879.54s - 881.54s |  Now a lot of customers
881.54s - 883.54s |  make the first mistake just because
883.54s - 885.54s |  they don't understand CBSS. They say,
885.54s - 887.54s |  oh, the privilege requirements
887.54s - 889.54s |  are that you have
889.54s - 891.54s |  to be authenticated.
891.54s - 893.54s |  And they
893.54s - 895.54s |  consider that not
895.54s - 897.54s |  self-signup. They consider that employee
897.54s - 899.54s |  level access. And so they think,
899.54s - 901.54s |  oh, well,
901.54s - 903.54s |  they had to self-register
903.54s - 905.54s |  for the site to get access
905.54s - 907.54s |  to this function and then hack this site.
907.54s - 909.54s |  But when that's free registration, really
909.54s - 911.54s |  that's open access. Anybody can register
911.54s - 913.54s |  for a website, get an account,
913.54s - 915.54s |  find a bug. And so they'll
915.54s - 917.54s |  do this on accident. They'll underscore
917.54s - 919.54s |  this. So there's several ways that they can do this by accident.
919.54s - 921.54s |  There's also
921.54s - 923.54s |  this world, and I've seen it
923.54s - 925.54s |  many times, where
925.54s - 927.54s |  the second level of triage at the
927.54s - 929.54s |  client is done by a security
929.54s - 931.54s |  engineer at the client site.
931.54s - 933.54s |  And, you know,
933.54s - 935.54s |  they're probably a really good security engineer,
935.54s - 937.54s |  but they're jaded because they have 800
937.54s - 939.54s |  submissions in the queue.
939.54s - 941.54s |  And so they start rating
941.54s - 943.54s |  bugs with a custom rubric that
943.54s - 945.54s |  they make themselves.
945.54s - 947.54s |  And it is
947.54s - 949.54s |  not very
949.54s - 951.54s |  data-driven. And so
951.54s - 953.54s |  what they'll do is they'll start
953.54s - 955.54s |  triaging based on
955.54s - 957.54s |  how long it takes to
957.54s - 959.54s |  exploit the bug, which shouldn't
959.54s - 961.54s |  matter, how
961.54s - 963.54s |  technical the bug is.
963.54s - 965.54s |  Sometimes you find really stupid stuff
965.54s - 967.54s |  like a website that
967.54s - 969.54s |  has a default password
969.54s - 971.54s |  and that lets a hacker into your systems.
971.54s - 973.54s |  But the impact
973.54s - 975.54s |  of that is what you should be, which should be
975.54s - 977.54s |  generating value for that, right?
977.54s - 979.54s |  And so if that DevSecOps panel
979.54s - 981.54s |  that had a default password on it
981.54s - 983.54s |  got them access to all your customer
983.54s - 985.54s |  data or all of your DevSecOps data
985.54s - 987.54s |  or all your logs or something, that
987.54s - 989.54s |  should be the end-all be-all way
989.54s - 991.54s |  that you triage a bug like that.
991.54s - 993.54s |  And then
993.54s - 995.54s |  sometimes they lower triage
995.54s - 997.54s |  or they lower impact
997.54s - 999.54s |  by saying that there was mitigating
999.54s - 1001.54s |  controls behind
1001.54s - 1003.54s |  the controls that
1003.54s - 1005.54s |  were passed, which there's no way for a
1005.54s - 1007.54s |  bug hunter to verify that.
1007.54s - 1009.54s |  And so a lot of times you get in a
1009.54s - 1011.54s |  lot of arbitration and
1011.54s - 1013.54s |  kind of bad
1013.54s - 1015.54s |  situations between people are like,
1015.54s - 1017.54s |  oh, we would have noticed that in our logs, or
1017.54s - 1019.54s |  we had a mitigating
1019.54s - 1021.54s |  manual check of this process.
1021.54s - 1023.54s |  And so the bug hunter doesn't know that.
1023.54s - 1025.54s |  They accessed your system,
1025.54s - 1027.54s |  accessed your logs, they had it, or
1027.54s - 1029.54s |  they exploited this vulnerability.
1029.54s - 1031.54s |  Pretty sure that it counts
1031.54s - 1033.54s |  for a bug bounty.
1033.54s - 1035.54s |  The other one that they can do, that really
1035.54s - 1037.54s |  shitty clients can do, is they can say there was an
1037.54s - 1039.54s |  existing issue in their backlog,
1039.54s - 1041.54s |  which I have seen outright
1041.54s - 1043.54s |  customers lie about.
1043.54s - 1045.54s |  They say, oh yeah, we knew about this issue.
1045.54s - 1047.54s |  It came from our pen testers two years
1047.54s - 1049.54s |  ago. We just haven't had time to fix it.
1049.54s - 1051.54s |  Well, if it was two fucking years ago,
1051.54s - 1053.54s |  that's bad.
1053.54s - 1055.54s |  And anyway, show me proof.
1055.54s - 1057.54s |  This is a very common one.
1057.54s - 1059.54s |  And again, I'm not saying
1059.54s - 1061.54s |  this is you guys. I'm saying this is the worst of all
1061.54s - 1063.54s |  customers I've ever seen. But there
1063.54s - 1068.38s |  are some shitty customers out there.
1068.38s - 1070.38s |  Okay, so another thing shitty
1070.38s - 1072.38s |  customers do is they make
1072.38s - 1074.38s |  payout ranges. And so
1074.38s - 1076.38s |  they'll say, hey, a critical bug is
1076.38s - 1078.38s |  worth like 20k
1078.38s - 1080.38s |  to us, or 50k, or
1080.38s - 1082.38s |  100k if they're going ham.
1082.38s - 1084.38s |  And
1084.38s - 1089.97s |  sorry, give me one second.
1089.97s - 1091.97s |  And so they'll make
1091.97s - 1093.97s |  these ranges for payment. They'll say
1093.97s - 1095.97s |  anything between 10 and
1095.97s - 1097.97s |  40k, depending on what we decide,
1097.97s - 1099.97s |  right? Less than 15%
1099.97s - 1101.97s |  of clients who use
1101.97s - 1103.97s |  ranges, sorry about the typos. I made the slides
1103.97s - 1105.97s |  last night. Less than 15%
1105.97s - 1107.97s |  of clients who use ranges pay anything above
1107.97s - 1109.97s |  the minimum of that range ever.
1109.97s - 1111.97s |  You have some gold star customers who do
1111.97s - 1113.97s |  that, like Google and Meta, and they
1113.97s - 1115.97s |  really have a vulnerability rating board
1115.97s - 1117.97s |  internally in the company.
1117.97s - 1119.97s |  But most of the time, they just pay
1119.97s - 1121.97s |  the bare minimum. And so setting
1121.97s - 1123.97s |  as a career hacker who's going to do bug bounty,
1123.97s - 1125.97s |  you can
1125.97s - 1127.97s |  really get kind of skunked on
1127.97s - 1129.97s |  what you think is going
1129.97s - 1131.97s |  to be a great program, and then you get wrecked.
1131.97s - 1133.97s |  This is very common right now in the web
1133.97s - 1135.97s |  3 space. So there are
1135.97s - 1137.97s |  a lot of web 3 bounties that want
1137.97s - 1139.97s |  to make a splash in the press and say,
1139.97s - 1141.97s |  if you can hack our crypto
1141.97s - 1143.97s |  system, we will give you
1143.97s - 1145.97s |  a million dollars. There's several of these
1145.97s - 1147.97s |  going on right now. And then
1147.97s - 1149.97s |  I've had several bug hunters break
1149.97s - 1151.97s |  into their sites, get all their customer
1151.97s - 1153.97s |  data, have the ability to backdoor their
1153.97s - 1155.97s |  algorithms, and basically mess
1155.97s - 1157.97s |  up their whole exchange. But
1157.97s - 1159.97s |  because the bug wasn't a
1159.97s - 1161.97s |  crypto-related bug, like a smart
1161.97s - 1163.97s |  contract bug, because it was a web
1163.97s - 1165.97s |  bug, they got paid
1165.97s - 1167.97s |  20K instead of a million.
1167.97s - 1169.97s |  And so there is
1169.97s - 1171.97s |  some really shady stuff going on like
1171.97s - 1173.97s |  that right now in the industry.
1173.97s - 1175.97s |  And those million dollar
1175.97s - 1177.97s |  payouts, they're mostly for marketing.
1177.97s - 1179.97s |  They're mostly a marketing
1179.97s - 1181.97s |  ploy to make the company look like they're more
1181.97s - 1183.97s |  secure. The only people I've seen
1183.97s - 1185.97s |  that pay million dollar bugs
1185.97s - 1187.97s |  at least recently, or close
1187.97s - 1189.97s |  to a million dollars, has been
1189.97s - 1191.97s |  T-Mobile has a really forward-facing
1191.97s - 1193.97s |  bug bounty program, and they've paid out really
1193.97s - 1195.97s |  high rewards for bug hunters
1195.97s - 1197.97s |  who did very specific things.
1197.97s - 1201.89s |  All right. So some of these
1201.89s - 1203.89s |  same things happen
1203.89s - 1205.89s |  at live events. So if you've never
1205.89s - 1207.89s |  been to a live event, how many of you have been to a live event
1207.89s - 1209.89s |  before, a hacker live event?
1209.89s - 1211.89s |  Cool. So some of you, yeah.
1211.89s - 1213.89s |  So if you haven't been,
1213.89s - 1215.89s |  live events at BugCrowd, HackerOne, Integrity,
1215.89s - 1217.89s |  Let'sHack, or
1217.89s - 1219.89s |  YesWeHack,
1219.89s - 1221.89s |  they're basically giant hacker
1221.89s - 1223.89s |  parties where
1223.89s - 1225.89s |  you fly out a whole bunch of really
1225.89s - 1227.89s |  good, really high-scoring, really well-known
1227.89s - 1229.89s |  bug hunters to a location
1229.89s - 1231.89s |  and they
1231.89s - 1233.89s |  basically focus on a single
1233.89s - 1235.89s |  company, and they
1235.89s - 1237.89s |  increase the rewards substantially
1237.89s - 1239.89s |  for this period, and
1239.89s - 1241.89s |  they open up NewScope.
1241.89s - 1243.89s |  Now several live events,
1243.89s - 1245.89s |  and you can talk to a bunch of the bug bounty
1245.89s - 1247.89s |  hunters, but
1247.89s - 1249.89s |  several live events have been the most
1249.89s - 1251.89s |  disastrous thing ever, where
1251.89s - 1253.89s |  the client puts in NewScope into the
1253.89s - 1255.89s |  program for the live event
1255.89s - 1257.89s |  and says, hey,
1257.89s - 1259.89s |  we're going to pay $20k
1259.89s - 1261.89s |  per critical vulnerability,
1261.89s - 1263.89s |  and then in 40 minutes
1263.89s - 1265.89s |  you get
1265.89s - 1267.89s |  40 critical vulnerabilities and completely
1267.89s - 1269.89s |  exhaust the whole live event budget.
1269.89s - 1271.89s |  And this is before, this hacking,
1271.89s - 1273.89s |  you have two weeks before you even go on-site
1273.89s - 1275.89s |  to do some of this hacking, so the budget
1275.89s - 1277.89s |  gets exhausted, like we saw
1277.89s - 1279.89s |  in previous slides, before the live event really
1279.89s - 1281.89s |  even happens. And then you
1281.89s - 1283.89s |  fly all these hackers out there, and then the customers
1283.89s - 1285.89s |  are nickel-and-diming the hackers, downgrading
1285.89s - 1287.89s |  their reports, out-of-scoping
1287.89s - 1289.89s |  their reports, combining them with other reports,
1289.89s - 1291.89s |  really unfairly, because they
1291.89s - 1293.89s |  basically have no budget left for the
1293.89s - 1295.89s |  project.
1295.89s - 1297.89s |  And it's kind of the fault,
1297.89s - 1299.89s |  in this case, of both
1299.89s - 1301.89s |  the expectations of the clients,
1301.89s - 1303.89s |  the non-understanding of the
1303.89s - 1305.89s |  scope, and non-understanding
1305.89s - 1307.89s |  about how effective live events are at
1307.89s - 1315.97s |  finding vulnerabilities.
1315.97s - 1317.97s |  So, there was a panel
1317.97s - 1319.97s |  earlier this week at the Bug Bounty Village,
1319.97s - 1321.97s |  there's a Bug Bounty Village here if you didn't know,
1321.97s - 1323.97s |  and the panel was
1323.97s - 1325.97s |  some of my closest friends
1325.97s - 1327.97s |  on this panel, and so I don't want
1327.97s - 1329.97s |  to, like, crap on them, really.
1329.97s - 1331.97s |  But they said something that really pissed me off.
1331.97s - 1333.97s |  So, basically
1333.97s - 1335.97s |  I'm paraphrasing here, but they said, like,
1335.97s - 1337.97s |  going public or tweeting or making
1337.97s - 1339.97s |  the platform's job harder
1339.97s - 1341.97s |  in any way will make them not
1341.97s - 1343.97s |  want to work with you and not get invited to
1343.97s - 1345.97s |  programs, which I think is a bunch
1345.97s - 1347.97s |  of bullshit, because we are the product.
1347.97s - 1349.97s |  All you have, if you are a
1349.97s - 1351.97s |  platform, is a goddamn webpage.
1351.97s - 1353.97s |  You don't have any way of finding vulnerabilities.
1353.97s - 1355.97s |  The hackers are the product.
1355.97s - 1357.97s |  And so if you think that
1357.97s - 1359.97s |  sharing data between platforms
1359.97s - 1361.97s |  and stuff is right, and, like, kind of blackballing
1361.97s - 1363.97s |  researchers,
1363.97s - 1365.97s |  you have grossly
1365.97s - 1367.97s |  not oriented
1367.97s - 1369.97s |  kind of your whole company the right way.
1369.97s - 1371.97s |  Your hackers are the only thing you really have.
1371.97s - 1373.97s |  Otherwise, you're a glorified
1373.97s - 1375.97s |  ticketing system.
1375.97s - 1377.97s |  Now, this happens
1377.97s - 1379.97s |  because platform triage
1379.97s - 1381.97s |  gets burnt out. They handle
1381.97s - 1383.97s |  hundreds of thousands of bugs a week.
1383.97s - 1385.97s |  I mean, I've managed these
1385.97s - 1387.97s |  teams, but it is a
1387.97s - 1389.97s |  core
1389.97s - 1391.97s |  need for that
1391.97s - 1393.97s |  team to be the stalwart defenders
1393.97s - 1395.97s |  of the hackers. The triage team at
1395.97s - 1397.97s |  the platform needs to make sure at every
1397.97s - 1399.97s |  opportunity the hackers are treated like rock stars
1399.97s - 1401.97s |  and they are stood up for.
1401.97s - 1403.97s |  Because if any time that any of these
1403.97s - 1405.97s |  hackers decide to not work on the program, they have
1405.97s - 1407.97s |  nothing to sell. And so
1407.97s - 1409.97s |  this paraphrase here of
1409.97s - 1411.97s |  those leaders at those companies
1411.97s - 1413.97s |  really made me mad, even though I knew them.
1413.97s - 1415.97s |  And so this goes back to the idea
1415.97s - 1417.97s |  that the hackers are the product and they're
1417.97s - 1419.97s |  being kind of mistreated in a lot of ways.
1419.97s - 1421.97s |  On some programs, not all.
1421.97s - 1427.30s |  The worst scenario of all
1427.30s - 1429.30s |  time that's happened at least once
1429.30s - 1431.30s |  documented was that internal
1431.30s - 1433.30s |  triagers at a platform
1433.30s - 1435.30s |  stole research from
1435.30s - 1437.30s |  a bug hunter and then resubmitted
1437.30s - 1439.30s |  it to other bug bounty programs in their own
1439.30s - 1441.30s |  name. So this has happened
1441.30s - 1443.30s |  at least once that we know of
1443.30s - 1445.30s |  and it is absolutely
1445.30s - 1447.30s |  atrocious. And so it caused
1447.30s - 1449.30s |  a kickoff of
1449.30s - 1451.30s |  basically a whole bunch of process
1451.30s - 1453.30s |  at this place where this happened.
1453.30s - 1455.30s |  And so
1455.30s - 1457.30s |  I would like to say that I
1457.30s - 1459.30s |  thought that that was the only instance that ever
1459.30s - 1461.30s |  happened was the one that got caught and publicized.
1461.30s - 1463.30s |  But I don't think it is.
1463.30s - 1465.30s |  I think that triage
1465.30s - 1467.30s |  jobs
1467.30s - 1469.30s |  they
1469.30s - 1471.30s |  basically those people get
1471.30s - 1473.30s |  to see all the research and it should be
1473.30s - 1475.30s |  held to a very high ethical standard for
1475.30s - 1477.30s |  keeping that vulnerability data
1477.30s - 1482.82s |  private.
1482.82s - 1484.82s |  Another thing that happens
1484.82s - 1486.82s |  in the bug bounty industry that's kind of crappy
1486.82s - 1488.82s |  is celebrity. And I'm guilty of this.
1488.82s - 1490.82s |  I am an infosex celebrity. I have
1490.82s - 1492.82s |  160,000 Twitter followers.
1492.82s - 1494.82s |  I connect with everybody on LinkedIn.
1494.82s - 1496.82s |  But I earned it. I have been
1496.82s - 1498.82s |  doing work and research for 20
1498.82s - 1500.82s |  years. And a lot of the big
1500.82s - 1502.82s |  bug hunters earn it. But what it
1502.82s - 1504.82s |  does is it creates a power disparity
1504.82s - 1506.82s |  with newer bug hunters who don't have
1506.82s - 1508.82s |  that celebrity. So let me give you some
1508.82s - 1510.82s |  examples of the advantages celebrity gives you
1510.82s - 1512.82s |  in bug bounty. Big names
1512.82s - 1514.82s |  get big service. So for instance
1514.82s - 1516.82s |  if I submit a bug, I
1516.82s - 1518.82s |  know Casey Ellis. He is the CTO
1518.82s - 1520.82s |  of Bug Crowd. I worked with him for five years
1520.82s - 1522.82s |  at Bug Crowd. If I think I'm being treated unfairly
1522.82s - 1524.82s |  if I really want to go out of my way
1524.82s - 1526.82s |  I can DM him and be like,
1526.82s - 1528.82s |  yo, why are you guys being stupid?
1528.82s - 1530.82s |  This is a good bug. I'm submitting it.
1530.82s - 1532.82s |  Talk to the triage team.
1532.82s - 1534.82s |  And so a lot of big name bug
1534.82s - 1536.82s |  hunters have this power. They know
1536.82s - 1538.82s |  internal employees. Some of them
1538.82s - 1540.82s |  at the platforms get their own CS reps.
1540.82s - 1542.82s |  So they get an actual CS rep
1542.82s - 1544.82s |  assigned to them to help them
1544.82s - 1546.82s |  get their bugs pushed through faster.
1546.82s - 1548.82s |  So they'll get out of band or instant
1548.82s - 1550.82s |  support. And
1550.82s - 1552.82s |  basically what it means is that these people
1552.82s - 1554.82s |  have like an unfair power dynamic
1554.82s - 1556.82s |  to somebody who's just coming up. In which
1556.82s - 1558.82s |  I've learned some but I still think there's a system
1558.82s - 1560.82s |  in where no name people
1560.82s - 1562.82s |  who don't have any rep or any research
1562.82s - 1564.82s |  to their name but find really really good bugs
1564.82s - 1566.82s |  which is the spirit of Bug Bounty. Anybody
1566.82s - 1568.82s |  can find a bug. I mean there was
1568.82s - 1570.82s |  there was this guy one time who had never done
1570.82s - 1572.82s |  Bug Bounty. He was a developer. I was working
1572.82s - 1574.82s |  on the platform.
1574.82s - 1576.82s |  And he's now a very famous
1576.82s - 1578.82s |  Bug Bounty hunter but he started off as a developer. And he found
1578.82s - 1580.82s |  the most amazing SSO
1580.82s - 1582.82s |  misconfiguration I've ever seen.
1582.82s - 1584.82s |  Completely wrecked this program
1584.82s - 1586.82s |  by basically being able to log in
1586.82s - 1588.82s |  as anyone in their whole SSO
1588.82s - 1590.82s |  kind of staple. Anyone in the company.
1590.82s - 1592.82s |  And that's the kind of
1592.82s - 1594.82s |  bugs you want. You want people coming out of the blue
1594.82s - 1596.82s |  and just finding amazing stuff.
1596.82s - 1598.82s |  But sometimes it doesn't happen like that
1598.82s - 1600.82s |  because nobody knows who they are.
1600.82s - 1602.82s |  So there should be a better system
1602.82s - 1607.18s |  for this. Other things that
1607.18s - 1609.18s |  really suck about the process is that after
1609.18s - 1611.18s |  after you have a couple
1611.18s - 1613.18s |  rounds of conversation with the platform
1613.18s - 1615.18s |  really it's done. The door is closed.
1615.18s - 1617.18s |  Like if you have two comments on
1617.18s - 1619.18s |  a submission and you disagree with
1619.18s - 1621.18s |  the rating or anything happens
1621.18s - 1623.18s |  there's no more recourse for you. They just shut you down.
1623.18s - 1625.18s |  Like that's it. You can comment
1625.18s - 1627.18s |  50 more times
1627.18s - 1629.18s |  and they can see it in the back end. They get alerts
1629.18s - 1631.18s |  but they just won't reply to you.
1631.18s - 1633.18s |  So at some point there's really no
1633.18s - 1635.18s |  recourse for bug hunters when they think that they've
1635.18s - 1639.20s |  been treated unfairly.
1639.20s - 1641.20s |  Five minutes right?
1641.20s - 1643.20s |  So I'm going to roll through this.
1643.20s - 1645.20s |  The worst form of Bug Bounty runner
1645.20s - 1647.20s |  is somebody who does a public VDP
1647.20s - 1649.20s |  to get free bugs and then runs a private
1649.20s - 1651.20s |  paid program
1651.20s - 1653.20s |  to basically funnel people into.
1653.20s - 1655.20s |  It's basically farming free work from bug hunters.
1655.20s - 1657.20s |  So that kind of sucks for
1657.20s - 1659.20s |  the community in general.
1659.20s - 1661.20s |  Let's see here.
1661.20s - 1663.20s |  Some other shitty things
1663.20s - 1665.20s |  are the platforms treat
1665.20s - 1667.20s |  hackers as the product in more than just
1667.20s - 1669.20s |  the hacking ways. They also
1669.20s - 1671.20s |  have in several
1671.20s - 1673.20s |  instances used them
1673.20s - 1675.20s |  as marketing tools as
1675.20s - 1677.20s |  many celebrities and they very
1677.20s - 1679.20s |  rarely pay them for that work or
1679.20s - 1681.20s |  anything like that.
1681.20s - 1683.20s |  Okay some tips and tricks
1683.20s - 1685.20s |  if you are a bounty hunter. Some of you did raise your
1685.20s - 1687.20s |  hand. I think like maybe 20 of you.
1687.20s - 1689.20s |  So if you want to engage in debating
1689.20s - 1691.20s |  criticality, one of my tips is
1691.20s - 1693.20s |  pre-provide your justification
1693.20s - 1695.20s |  in CVS 4.0
1695.20s - 1697.20s |  in the original submission. So don't let
1697.20s - 1699.20s |  them make the mistake.
1699.20s - 1701.20s |  Pre-write it out. Here is why this is
1701.20s - 1703.20s |  access level this. Here is why privileges
1703.20s - 1705.20s |  required are this.
1705.20s - 1707.20s |  If you want your bug to get triaged
1707.20s - 1709.20s |  with high impact
1709.20s - 1711.20s |  also do some research on what
1711.20s - 1713.20s |  compliance they may be subject to and
1713.20s - 1715.20s |  reference that the bug might cause them to be
1715.20s - 1717.20s |  out of compliance with X, Y, and
1717.20s - 1719.20s |  Z. And then write out your impact
1719.20s - 1721.20s |  scenario in your bug really
1721.20s - 1723.20s |  really well. Scare the shit out of them if
1723.20s - 1725.20s |  you can. Use chat GPT if you have to
1725.20s - 1727.20s |  do it. But do this
1727.20s - 1729.20s |  and you will get paid more consistently.
1729.20s - 1732.86s |  If you have a bug
1732.86s - 1734.86s |  that is in a multi-use platform
1734.86s - 1736.86s |  don't submit
1736.86s - 1738.86s |  it to everything all at once.
1738.86s - 1740.86s |  Submit it to one program
1740.86s - 1742.86s |  get it paid, wait
1742.86s - 1744.86s |  for a little bit and then submit it to another program
1744.86s - 1746.86s |  and then wait for a little bit and then submit it
1746.86s - 1748.86s |  to another program to make sure that
1748.86s - 1750.86s |  they're not doing anything nefarious like sharing
1750.86s - 1752.86s |  your attack strings among their customers
1752.86s - 1754.86s |  and just kind of visit
1754.86s - 1756.86s |  and just kind of make sure that
1756.86s - 1758.86s |  you can stagger your bug.
1758.86s - 1760.86s |  A lot of times what customers will do is they'll say
1760.86s - 1762.86s |  oh we're going to
1762.86s - 1764.86s |  make one fix and it'll fix all
1764.86s - 1766.86s |  these things if you shoot
1766.86s - 1768.86s |  a vulnerability class at them.
1768.86s - 1770.86s |  So if you stagger your reports
1770.86s - 1772.86s |  and then they give you that answer
1772.86s - 1774.86s |  or if you stagger your reports
1774.86s - 1776.86s |  they'll fix the one bug and then you can wait a little while
1776.86s - 1778.86s |  and send another one and then eventually
1778.86s - 1780.86s |  if they say hey we're going to do one fix for all of this
1780.86s - 1782.86s |  then you can test after
1782.86s - 1784.86s |  that too. And then revisit all your old
1784.86s - 1786.86s |  bugs for bypasses as well.
1786.86s - 1793.66s |  Let's see here.
1793.66s - 1795.66s |  Some tips if you
1795.66s - 1797.66s |  want to kind of go out of scope every once in a while
1797.66s - 1799.66s |  or you find something that you think is out of scope
1799.66s - 1801.66s |  I have used a submission
1801.66s - 1803.66s |  just to ask the client a question
1803.66s - 1805.66s |  which puts the bug bounty platform in a little
1805.66s - 1807.66s |  bit of a weird way. I don't care it doesn't hurt
1807.66s - 1809.66s |  my submission score a lot but like here's
1809.66s - 1811.66s |  an example. So for State Farm
1811.66s - 1813.66s |  they didn't have creds on
1813.66s - 1815.66s |  GitHub in their scope
1815.66s - 1817.66s |  and so I just burned a submission
1817.66s - 1819.66s |  and I said hey I think I found like 20 creds
1819.66s - 1821.66s |  for people in
1821.66s - 1823.66s |  GitHub.
1823.66s - 1825.66s |  Do you want me to submit this?
1825.66s - 1827.66s |  And so then the triage team
1827.66s - 1829.66s |  has to forward it to the customer and they have to answer
1829.66s - 1831.66s |  it honestly. Now it has to be worded
1831.66s - 1833.66s |  carefully because otherwise that could seem
1833.66s - 1835.66s |  like extortion and I'm going to give
1835.66s - 1837.66s |  them the bugs anyway. That's what I'm going to do.
1837.66s - 1839.66s |  If they say no I'm going to be like cool
1839.66s - 1841.66s |  sucks you don't take it here's 20
1841.66s - 1843.66s |  things. So I'm never
1843.66s - 1845.66s |  on the edge of extortion but at
1845.66s - 1847.66s |  least they see it and have the opportunity to
1847.66s - 1849.66s |  say okay yeah this is cool
1849.66s - 1851.66s |  we'll pay this guy. That's a tip there.
1853.66s - 1855.66s |  When push comes
1855.66s - 1857.66s |  to shove at the end when
1857.66s - 1859.66s |  you are locked out you can't make any more
1859.66s - 1861.66s |  comments you've done all kinds of escalations on the
1861.66s - 1863.66s |  platforms the customer is not agreeing
1863.66s - 1865.66s |  with you but you still have a good bug
1865.66s - 1867.66s |  well then you can ask for disclosure
1867.66s - 1869.66s |  or you can just YOLO disclose the bug
1869.66s - 1871.66s |  via a blog post or Twitter.
1871.66s - 1873.66s |  And so
1873.66s - 1875.66s |  this happens often when companies
1875.66s - 1877.66s |  think it's out of scope or NA
1877.66s - 1879.66s |  a bug not applicable
1879.66s - 1881.66s |  a bug
1881.66s - 1883.66s |  and so if they think it's out of scope
1883.66s - 1885.66s |  or not applicable or no security impact
1885.66s - 1887.66s |  these are all the three ways they can rate it
1887.66s - 1889.66s |  then by contract
1889.66s - 1891.66s |  I actually don't have the right to blog about
1891.66s - 1893.66s |  it on the platforms. As soon as I press
1893.66s - 1895.66s |  the submit button for a vulnerability on a platform
1895.66s - 1897.66s |  it belongs to the platform that data
1897.66s - 1899.66s |  and that is the contract I have to sign
1899.66s - 1901.66s |  but I think that we should have the right
1901.66s - 1903.66s |  as bug bounty hunters to disclose if someone
1903.66s - 1905.66s |  thinks it's out of scope or they don't care about it
1905.66s - 1907.66s |  we should be able to write about it we spent time
1907.66s - 1909.66s |  researching it and trying to help them
1909.66s - 1911.66s |  and so I hope that changes over the years.
1911.66s - 1913.66s |  Closing thoughts
1913.66s - 1915.66s |  platforms are nothing
1915.66s - 1917.66s |  without their product the hackers
1917.66s - 1919.66s |  heavy education needs to happen
1919.66s - 1921.66s |  to clients on what kind of the core
1921.66s - 1923.66s |  of the bug bounty contract is
1923.66s - 1925.66s |  better communication needs to improve
1925.66s - 1927.66s |  on all platform features
1927.66s - 1929.66s |  and every function of a bug bounty in the
1929.66s - 1931.66s |  triage cycle and in the
1931.66s - 1933.66s |  creation cycle needs to be documented
1933.66s - 1935.66s |  just like source code is just like you can
1935.66s - 1937.66s |  review a revision history to keep everybody
1937.66s - 1939.66s |  honest
1939.66s - 1941.66s |  that's it
