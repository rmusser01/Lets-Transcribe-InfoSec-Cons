**The Old Good Internet**
- **Question**: What happened to the old good internet?
- Examples of past internet benefits: Google search efficiency, Facebook's original feed, Uber's affordability, Amazon's reliable products, Apple's privacy focus.

**Enshittification Stages**
- **Stage One**: Businesses initially provide value to users.
- **Stage 1A**: Locking in users through network effects and incentives.
- **Stage Two**: User experience deteriorates for business advantage.
- **Stage Three**: Value extraction for company benefit, minimal user utility.

**Lock-in Techniques**
- Network effects, financial incentives like Amazon Prime and Audible subscriptions.
- Digital rights management (DRM) to limit user options.
- Vendor-specific hardware and software limitations.

**Twiddling**
- Altering backend operations for business benefit.
- Examples include Uber's wage discrimination and platform content moderation.
- TikTok's "heating tool" for influencing content visibility.

**Market Dynamics and Consolidation**
- Lack of competition leads to user and business exploitation.
- Companies like Amazon drive up prices across markets.
- Regulatory capture and anti-competitive practices stifle innovation.

**Regulatory and Legal Barriers**
- Historical lack of competition and regulation enforcement.
- Examples of government inaction and outdated privacy laws.
- The impact of monopolistic practices on market dynamics.

**Workers' Influence and Unionization**
- Tech workers' historical power due to scarcity.
- Recent layoffs weakening individual bargaining power.
- Advocacy for tech worker unions to regain influence.

**Conclusion**
- The internet's current state results from diminished checks on corporate power.
- Calls for restoring competition, regulation, interoperability, and worker power.
- Emphasis on building a new, better internet for future challenges.
