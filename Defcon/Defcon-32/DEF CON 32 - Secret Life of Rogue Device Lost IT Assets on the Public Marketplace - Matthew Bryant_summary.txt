**Introduction to Rogue Devices**
- **Definition of Rogue Hardware**: Devices that should not appear on secondhand markets.
- Examples include **employee laptops**, **hardware prototypes**, and **classified government computers**.

**Research Overview**
- **Objective**: To understand the scope and impact of rogue devices on public markets.
- Methods include scraping over **150 million images** from online listings and **reverse engineering** apps.

**Challenges in Research**
- **Identifying Rogue Hardware**: Sellers often unaware of the true nature of devices.
- **Scraping Platforms**: Different challenges with Western platforms like **eBay** and Eastern platforms like **Shen You**.
- **Rate Limiting and API Restrictions**: Overcoming obstacles like **rate limiting** and **custom signing APIs**.

**Tools and Techniques**
- **OCR Utilization**: Use of **OCR technology** to extract information from images.
- **Hardware Setup**: Building an OCR cluster using old iPhones for effective image processing.

**Findings from Research**
- **Types of Rogue Devices Found**: Employee laptops, prototypes, factory line equipment.
- **Security Risks**: Data leakage from devices with sensitive information.

**Case Studies**
- **Apple Devices**: Discovery of Apple prototypes and internal data.
- **Time Capsule Incident**: Recovery of sensitive data from a disposed Apple **Time Capsule**.

**Market Dynamics**
- **Western vs Eastern Markets**: Differences in platforms and selling practices.
- **Community Assistance**: Use of agents familiar with Chinese markets to facilitate purchases.

**Conclusions and Implications**
- **Ethical Considerations**: Debate on morality of purchasing and investigating rogue devices.
- **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**: Highlighting risks in hardware supply and disposal processes.
- **E-Waste Concerns**: Importance of ensuring proper destruction of devices to prevent data leakage.
