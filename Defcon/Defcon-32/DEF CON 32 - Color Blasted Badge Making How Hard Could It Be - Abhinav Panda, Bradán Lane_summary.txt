**Event Overview**
- Title: "DEF CON 32 - Color Blasted Badge Making: How Hard Could It Be"
- Presenters: Abhinav Panda, Bradán Lane, and Hamster
- Description: Discussion on various methods for creating colorful badges with insights on techniques, challenges, and successes.

**Introduction**
- Reanimation from the Badgelife Discord introduces the session.
- Discussion focuses on different badge-making techniques: UV printing, screen printing, and dye sublimation.

**UV Printing (Abhinav Panda)**
- **Background**: Abhinav Panda has been involved in Badgelife for eight years, initially started with Indian conference badges.
- **Technique**: 
  - Utilizes **UV printing** for full-color badges.
  - UV printers can print on various materials like banners, acrylic, and phone cases.
  - Initial experiments led to buying a UV printer, allowing for extensive badge production.
  - **Challenges**: Alignment issues, curing time, and maintaining printhead health.
- **Process**:
  - Print directly on the bed first, align PCBs, and print again.
  - Manual alignment of PCBs to fix issues common with UV printing.
  - Adjustments necessary for reflow to prevent color changes.
  - High maintenance; requires daily printing to maintain printer health.
- **Future Plans**: Considering starting a PCB assembly or UV printing service.

**Screen Printing (Brayden Lane)**
- **Background**: Collaborated with Panda; constrained by lack of resources for UV printing.
- **Technique**:
  - **Traditional silk screening** adapted for PCBs.
  - Uses publicly available silk screens and UV exposed emulsion.
  - Challenges include scaling and achieving consistent color through multiple passes.
- **Process**:
  - Uses solder paste stenciling equipment for precise alignment.
  - Multiple colors require multiple silk screen processes.
  - Limitations with full RGB color; uses split fountain for gradients.
- **Equipment**:
  - Utilizes standard manual solder paste stenciling equipment.
  - Challenges in UV curing; adapted a reflow oven with UV lamps for curing.
  - High detail requires refined equipment, using higher mesh counts for accuracy.
- **Future Considerations**: Plans to continue using silk screening for specific projects.

**Dye Sublimation (Hamster)**
- **Background**: Interested in adding full color to PCBs; inspired by wife's crafting equipment.
- **Technique**:
  - Uses wife's dye sublimation setup for t-shirts and mugs.
  - Process involves printing onto dye sub paper and transferring onto PCBs using a heated t-shirt press.
  - **Challenges**: Difficulties in achieving rich colors, especially blacks.
- **Process**:
  - Reflow boards first, then perform dye sublimation.
  - Uses heat press for 30 seconds at 360°F.
  - Allows for quick turnaround on badge designs.
  - Cost-effective setup, under $250 for materials and equipment.
- **Experimentation**: Still working on improving color richness and consistency.

**Panel Discussion**
- **Questions and Answers**:
  - Discussed issues like color quality, finish types, and curing techniques.
  - Explored experiences with different materials and board types.
  - Addressed concerns of scalability and cost with each method.
  - Shared personal experiences with failures and how they were resolved.

**Final Thoughts**
- Panelists discussed the viability of their chosen methods.
- Interest in exploring other techniques for future projects.
- Emphasis on the artistic side of badge making and the continuous experimentation involved.
