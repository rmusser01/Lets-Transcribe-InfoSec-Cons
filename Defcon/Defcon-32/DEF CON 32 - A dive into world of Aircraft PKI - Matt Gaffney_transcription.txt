 So I'm Matt Gaffney also known as Gaffers. I'm a principal engineer at United
7.68s - 14.36s |  Airlines. I'm also a village lead at the Aerospace Village so a big shout out to
14.36s - 20.88s |  those guys put on a great show this year. I'm going to do a shallow dive into
20.88s - 24.80s |  aircraft PKI and I've got a few caveats to start with. Like I said this is a
24.80s - 30.52s |  shallow dive into the topic. I see a few operators that I recognize in the room
30.52s - 35.56s |  and at least one expert who will know this topic several times better than I
35.56s - 39.76s |  ever will and you'll understand when I say this this is something you can
39.76s - 46.00s |  easily spend three days talking about. It is so complex. So there are some
46.00s - 50.16s |  simplifications and there are some generalizations and I'm also only going
50.16s - 55.00s |  to speak to what I'm authorized to speak to. And through the village our
55.00s - 58.96s |  ethos is to bring light and not heat to the topic of cyber in aerospace. So this
58.96s - 62.28s |  will be supplier agnostic and there are some industry challenges that we're
62.28s - 69.16s |  working together to fix which I cannot cover. All right that's what we'll go
69.16s - 76.80s |  through today. The importance, some use cases, methods A, B and C, a bit of it on
76.80s - 83.04s |  ATA spec 42 and then some about post-quantum world PKI for aircraft. I've
83.04s - 85.92s |  included a slide of acronyms because I know the slides are going to be
85.92s - 91.68s |  available later through DEFCON but like I said those you who work in aerospace
91.68s - 95.56s |  will know what I'm talking about. I will try to name them out every time I
95.56s - 101.80s |  mention the first time around. If I don't just throw something at me. So why is it
101.80s - 105.16s |  important? Well in aviation with this thing called field loadable software or
105.20s - 110.60s |  FLS and in modern commercial aircraft FLS is everywhere and don't just think
110.60s - 115.24s |  about your IFE right. You know it's like you're in flight entertainment sorry
115.24s - 120.20s |  with your films or movies. We have sensors which generate logs for
120.20s - 123.44s |  maintenance and preventive maintenance, communication systems,
123.44s - 128.32s |  control surfaces and navigation databases. And then for legacy and in
128.32s - 134.32s |  most cases on next-gen aircraft if you wanted to update the firmware in a line
134.36s - 139.48s |  replaceable unit or an LRU you'd have to take it out and put a new one in.
139.48s - 145.32s |  Whereas with the enabled aircraft there are certain LRUs to which you can just
145.32s - 150.04s |  push new FLS to activate new features or just to update the functionality to fix
150.04s - 155.68s |  any bugs. And if you saw my talk on DEFCON 28 on the aircraft information
155.68s - 160.24s |  systems domain you might remember my favorite factoid and that's that
160.24s - 165.88s |  there are about 1,400 different software parts on a 787 and to control
165.88s - 174.64s |  the bathrooms. So these are the typical use cases. It's not an exhaustive list
174.64s - 179.28s |  but it covers the main use cases in commercial aviation and those which I
179.28s - 186.40s |  generally have time for today. So aircraft operators receive FLS from
186.40s - 190.84s |  multiple sources. They can be manufacturers, OEMs, suppliers and even
190.84s - 196.80s |  from internal teams who can build a subtype of FLS called UMI or user
196.80s - 202.16s |  modifiable information. A good example of UMI is a configuration load for the
202.16s - 205.84s |  aircraft information systems domain on certain aircraft which will define
205.84s - 210.84s |  things like connectivity to the ground, enabling and disabling features or
210.84s - 214.72s |  systems. And that is a part we would create and sign before we can put it on
214.72s - 219.48s |  the aircraft. And when we receive an FLS from an external source we are required
219.48s - 224.08s |  by regulation to verify its authenticity. For handling FLS the
224.08s - 227.40s |  manufacturers provide operators with the software to which we configure them
227.40s - 231.44s |  with the verified suppliers trust chains and that allows us to verify it's been
231.44s - 238.38s |  signed by the trusted entity. As important as verifying its
238.38s - 243.06s |  authenticity it's vital we check the FLS integrity as well and we're also
243.06s - 248.74s |  required by regulation to do that as well. In fact through various standards
248.74s - 251.30s |  we're mandated to do this before uploading to the aircraft and there's a
251.30s - 254.18s |  new requirement and I'm sure I'm gonna get some eye rolls from somebody in the
254.18s - 260.38s |  front row here about the recent implementation or basically new rules
260.38s - 267.02s |  around using ARINC 645-1 portable data loaders or PDLs. It's been a bit of a
267.02s - 273.94s |  thing for us but these enforce signature checking of the FLS prior to loading
273.94s - 277.86s |  onto the aircraft for in a technical sense so we're not relying on the on the
277.86s - 281.62s |  mechanic or the technician to do those checks you actually can't physically put
281.62s - 287.20s |  it on the aircraft until that signature has been checked which is great. And it
287.20s - 290.60s |  may or may not surprise you when I say that an aircraft can generate
290.60s - 294.88s |  hundreds of megabytes if not several gigabytes of data per flight length.
294.88s - 299.38s |  We've come a long way from the days of OOE messages over A cars although they
299.38s - 305.76s |  do still exist. The vast majority of data comes from the engines or certain
305.76s - 309.68s |  aircraft if you have a Navy pilot and he slams it on a landing some F you know
309.68s - 315.40s |  the carbon fiber aircraft they also generate stress data and as soon as the
315.40s - 318.36s |  aircraft touches down you get that infamous weight on wheels signal to the
318.36s - 321.40s |  avionics it will start trying to establish a link to the ground systems
321.40s - 328.41s |  and sometimes even before the aircraft reaches the gate. These connections are
328.41s - 333.17s |  typically 4G and Wi-Fi and most airport gates have an access point for a service
333.17s - 338.97s |  called gate link which can best be described as a common use network
339.05s - 343.29s |  dedicated for aircraft traffic and for that reason many operators also
343.29s - 347.77s |  implemented VPN through gate link to their network boundary and depending on
347.77s - 352.01s |  the aircraft each VPN can require between one and three certificates just
352.01s - 358.09s |  for that connection and that's per aircraft. It's also worth noting the logs
358.09s - 363.15s |  are digitally signed and verified before being ingested by the operator in the
363.15s - 370.30s |  relevant tools or sent on to third parties for analysis. Certificates can
370.30s - 376.18s |  also be used to enforce boundary server and even application authentication. It
376.18s - 382.18s |  does require mapping these certificates to AD identities which is fun especially
382.18s - 386.02s |  if you operate a large number of enabled aircraft and it's no secret that you
386.02s - 390.98s |  know at United we're trying to upgrade our fleet I think when I started with a
390.98s - 395.26s |  hundred and fifty enabled aircraft in our fleet which was a minority by the
395.26s - 398.62s |  time we finished updating it we'll have over a thousand enabled aircraft and
398.90s - 403.58s |  that's gonna mean a lot of work in terms of this PKI and the connectivity piece
403.58s - 411.30s |  and the final use case I'd like to cover today touches a little bit on ETA spec
411.30s - 415.70s |  42 which I'm going to cover a bit later on but suffice to say there are some
415.70s - 421.54s |  real wins possible using certificates in smart cards for user authentication. Not
421.54s - 425.74s |  only does it provide two-factor without a mobile device but it has advantages
425.74s - 430.86s |  from a user experience perspective as well. If you're in a public facing role
431.22s - 436.42s |  would you rather a password with 15 plus characters which is rotated every three
436.42s - 449.09s |  to 12 months or would you prefer a smart card with a pin code instead and every
449.09s - 454.25s |  time you log in you type in a pin code and when you pull the smart card out it
454.25s - 458.57s |  locks the screen automatically. So you get great security you also get a great
458.57s - 463.57s |  user experience as well and if you're a gate agent working in a public area that
463.61s - 470.60s |  could be a real win. We're working on it but going back to signing FLS so ETA
470.60s - 475.96s |  spec 42 requires all PKI subscribers to authenticate to the PKI management
475.96s - 480.92s |  platform using those smart card based hardware certificates like I just showed
480.92s - 488.94s |  you my hand there. The spec puts a huge emphasis on identity verification, dual
488.94s - 494.50s |  controls and audit of all activities. Without strong authentication mechanisms
494.62s - 499.50s |  all of that would be for naught. In some scenarios and depending on the method
499.50s - 503.30s |  used to sign the FLS the signing certificate can be held on the smart
503.30s - 508.58s |  card of those specific authorized sorry those specific subscribers who are
508.58s - 514.93s |  authorized to sign the software. So coming on to the signing then so signing
514.93s - 523.01s |  FLS method A on the left there we're receiving the receiving the software or
523.01s - 528.77s |  it's coming from that internal team and in method A it's typically in this
528.77s - 535.41s |  scenario it's typically unsigned. If it was signed it would just be verified and
535.41s - 543.37s |  then put into the storage or the repository. But in method A you get
543.37s - 549.77s |  your data your software part here which is an ARINC 665 load. Basically it's
549.77s - 554.41s |  an ARINC standard of zip file structures and the header files and
554.41s - 563.21s |  then using the manufacturer provided tools the device sponsor here will use
563.21s - 570.05s |  their smart card and they will the software will then verify that
570.05s - 575.73s |  certificate on his smart card with an OCSP response and if it's valid the
575.73s - 579.25s |  software will go ahead and sign that software using that device sponsors
579.25s - 585.25s |  private key and it creates a load with a signed OCSP response along with the
585.25s - 589.97s |  data and the encrypted hash or the signature. And this is great it's got a
589.97s - 595.17s |  bunch of advantages. So once an FLS has been signed with a valid certificate it
595.17s - 599.85s |  never needs to be signed again unless that software is modified. So it doesn't
599.85s - 605.53s |  matter if that certificate is revoked later or it expires we know that at the
605.53s - 612.79s |  time of signing that that certificate was valid. And also in this situation the
612.79s - 616.75s |  aircraft does not need to an access a CRL or a certificate revocation list it
616.75s - 622.15s |  just needs to be configured with a trust chain. The disadvantages are you don't
622.15s - 626.75s |  control the PKI and you have to pay for it and also you know these ground system
626.75s - 630.35s |  environments often use virtual machines and if you can imagine here I've
630.35s - 635.31s |  oversimplified it here but this device sponsors probably on it on a laptop going
635.31s - 639.71s |  to a jump box to go into a high secure zone and you've got to get that smart
639.71s - 643.43s |  card that he's got his laptop read by the software that's on a VM through a
643.43s - 647.43s |  jump box. That can be tricky to set up and I'm probably getting some nods in
647.43s - 656.63s |  the front row I can't see for the lights. Method B a little bit more simplistic so
656.63s - 663.63s |  we will receive data signed or unsigned if it's signed we verify the signature
663.63s - 671.31s |  and then strip it off and then we keep our signing signature or signing
671.31s - 678.67s |  certificate sorry in a HSM which is used by that software checks on this is
678.67s - 683.67s |  checked by the CRL of course and then goes a much more simple structure here
683.67s - 687.71s |  and then goes into repository. From the repository I didn't cover that in the
687.71s - 691.27s |  last slide sorry there are multiple ways to get that from the repository to the
691.27s - 697.43s |  aircraft. There is this over-the-air technique which some aircraft enable us
697.43s - 701.63s |  to do. It still requires a mechanic or a technician to go into the cockpit and
701.63s - 705.47s |  press some buttons and there's some other conditions which have to be true
705.47s - 710.23s |  as well so all this science fiction you read about changing software in flight
710.23s - 714.15s |  yeah I'm going to tell you what those conditions are but there are conditions
714.15s - 718.51s |  which stop that kind of thing. We can also use USBs and these are not your
718.51s - 724.75s |  typical USBs you keep at home these are actually assigned as tools and they are
724.75s - 727.79s |  treated as such they're signed in and out the tool store they go through
727.79s - 732.59s |  procedures to wipe and clean them or at least they should anyway and then the
732.59s - 737.11s |  one in the middle there is a PDL or a portable data loader that's what I was
737.11s - 745.39s |  talking about earlier there at 6451 and they will connect to the network pull
745.39s - 748.39s |  the software into the PDL you walk to the aircraft and plug the PDL into the
748.39s - 754.46s |  aircraft and do it that way and then there's method C which is very similar
754.46s - 762.50s |  to method A but it also includes a signed SCDP response as well okay and as
762.50s - 768.26s |  far as I'm aware and correct me if I'm wrong but I'm not aware of this method
768.26s - 773.02s |  in use for commercial aircraft today may well happen in the future but today it's
773.02s - 777.82s |  not currently in operation for commercial aircraft but it does have
777.82s - 784.70s |  practical uses where FLS is designed to be kept for a long term because while I
784.70s - 787.86s |  said earlier in method A the FLS doesn't need to be reassigned that's only as
787.86s - 793.42s |  long as the CA it was issued for from remains valid so that could be a few
793.42s - 798.10s |  years or it could be 20 years depending on when you've caught it in that cycle
798.10s - 803.54s |  method C allows for really long-term FLS to remain valid with the least amount of
803.54s - 807.98s |  disruption to any aircraft FLS you've got loaded on there it's also an
807.98s - 812.14s |  interesting solution for record-keeping in aircraft maintenance
812.14s - 815.34s |  where you have to keep documentation sometimes for the lifespan of the
815.34s - 818.38s |  aircraft and be able and you have to be able to prove that it hasn't been
818.38s - 828.70s |  modified during that time so this is a typical process load for the generation
828.70s - 832.38s |  of an aircraft certificate it is not by all means the only way of doing it but
832.38s - 838.06s |  I'm pressed for time so it's the only one I'm going to cover today so keying an
838.06s - 841.14s |  aircraft is part of the maintenance function and this means procedures are
841.14s - 844.70s |  in place to make sure it's done only when authorized and there's adequate
844.70s - 850.22s |  documentation and approvals in the process so obviously your device sponsor
850.22s - 854.42s |  here or you know somebody in your technical operations department tech ops
854.42s - 860.02s |  will generate the key instruction or the key generation work instruction and then
860.02s - 864.58s |  someone would go to the aircraft and generate that key pair and then
864.58s - 869.38s |  depending on whether you've got over the air or whether you're using PDLs and
869.38s - 875.54s |  USBs you will bring that CSR back to the network validate it and then send it off
875.54s - 884.06s |  to your PKI provider the RA function there that's the registration authority
884.06s - 889.90s |  that's an interesting one so this is an ATA spec 42 requirement and it's all
889.90s - 897.86s |  about dual control ATA spec 42 requires the PKI to have this registration
897.86s - 903.74s |  authority who proves all registrations and requests and when an airline
903.74s - 908.54s |  outsources their PKI operation to a third party there can be a need to
908.54s - 913.42s |  insert an airline employee as the RA inside the PKI provider and that's where
913.42s - 918.50s |  this stuff gets interesting and this is especially important for confirming
918.50s - 923.78s |  aircraft identities because the PKI provider they do PKI they don't do
923.78s - 932.02s |  aircraft right not all the time but there is one and this can this creates a
932.02s - 935.70s |  challenge when it comes to the audit side of the of the PKI and obviously
935.70s - 940.30s |  that audit is a key part of spec 42 but yes the RA will authenticate and
940.30s - 944.22s |  approve the CSR that then gets passed on to the certificate authority who will
944.22s - 949.50s |  again validate the CSR information and then and the signature and then issue
949.50s - 955.22s |  the certificate and then your technician goes back retrieves the certificate
955.22s - 958.86s |  generates the word loading work instruction takes it to the aircraft the
958.86s - 963.90s |  aircraft validates certificate and you know Bob's your uncle that's a typical
963.90s - 967.74s |  process and as you can see one of the key things is that just like if you were
967.74s - 971.42s |  generating you know a key pair on a server the private key stays on the
971.42s - 984.76s |  aircraft spec 42 so the ATA e-business data security working group or the DSWG
984.76s - 989.96s |  is set is to set the strategic path for these standards and ensure that all
989.96s - 994.80s |  project team efforts and specification changes requests are consistent with the
994.80s - 1000.00s |  industry's e-business vision mission and strategic plan I couldn't paste that
1000.00s - 1006.16s |  from their website I never sound that professional but basically it's a
1006.16s - 1010.36s |  group formed by experts across the industry including OAMs manufacturers
1010.36s - 1018.96s |  operators I'm in there I feel very I feel less intelligent than I usually do
1018.96s - 1022.16s |  in that room because these guys have just brains the size of a planet but
1022.16s - 1026.34s |  it's important that we're there suppliers are in the room and then
1026.34s - 1031.14s |  interested parties from the ATA membership as well and an ATA spec 42
1031.14s - 1033.74s |  has a strong emphasis on the establishment of trust based on
1033.74s - 1038.66s |  verified identity so when you become a subscriber as a person you go through
1038.66s - 1043.50s |  identity checks to verify that you are who you say you are and that then goes
1043.50s - 1049.14s |  through two-person control as well we also have strong emphasis on certificate
1049.14s - 1055.42s |  usage technical and procedural controls protection of PII audit documents it's
1055.54s - 1060.46s |  410 pages and it's very complex language I'm gonna be straight with you the first
1060.46s - 1065.06s |  time I read it it was tough I did not get it it took me several reads and it
1065.06s - 1070.38s |  also put me to sleep a few times I'm not gonna lie it's a good cure for insomnia
1070.38s - 1078.58s |  but we were told that all PKI have to basically used to design software parts
1078.58s - 1082.98s |  shall now be compliant with the ATA spec 42 so what that means is if we're using
1083.14s - 1088.42s |  one certificate to sign parts then we're gonna start using ATA spec 42
1088.42s - 1093.14s |  compliant certificates for all of our PKI so that's what we've been doing
1093.14s - 1098.46s |  audit scope is defined by the network and technology used in operating the PKI
1098.46s - 1103.26s |  it's a bit like the fruit of the poison tree so everything the PKI touches is in
1103.26s - 1108.70s |  scope so remember that RA role I was talking about earlier this is where it
1108.70s - 1113.34s |  gets fun because the RA is considered part of the PKI but they use the
1113.34s - 1119.62s |  operators IT and network and so to avoid bringing that in the entire operator IT
1119.62s - 1125.10s |  into a very painful and thorough audit they need to use a very locked down IT
1125.10s - 1131.58s |  device which with you know bare bones of what's required and you know minimum
1131.58s - 1136.14s |  interaction with the network and the infrastructure it's strictly controlled
1136.14s - 1139.06s |  by the certificate policy and the certificate practice statement and forms
1139.06s - 1142.78s |  a part of the on-site checks during the annual audit so we've got a few of these
1142.78s - 1146.42s |  in you know all over the country actually because a lot of us are remote
1146.42s - 1149.98s |  and the auditors gonna have to go and fly and see them and check they're
1149.98s - 1158.66s |  locked down to the specifications in the CPS so it's it's fun and then finally so
1158.66s - 1164.42s |  the challenges to aviation PKI in a post quantum world this one's been really you
1164.42s - 1170.18s |  know eating away at my brain the last you know six to twelve months because
1170.18s - 1173.46s |  the the threats are not only very real but also very difficult to figure out in
1173.46s - 1178.62s |  terms of aviation depending on who you talk to quantum computer capable of
1178.62s - 1184.10s |  breaking Shor's algorithm is either 5 10 15 or 20 years away but regardless an
1184.10s - 1190.02s |  aircraft lifespan is typically 30 years or even more and once an aircraft is
1190.02s - 1196.46s |  certified it's really hard to change it it's certainly very expensive I mean the
1196.46s - 1199.62s |  rumor is it takes so much testing that changing one line of code in the avionics
1199.62s - 1202.14s |  costs a million dollars just because you have to go through all those tests
1202.14s - 1206.70s |  afterwards don't know if that's true or not but that's what I've been told so
1206.70s - 1211.94s |  imagine how much effort it would take to enable post quantum key sizes across all
1211.94s - 1217.58s |  manufacturers and all fleets does the hardware in the LIU have the required
1217.58s - 1223.46s |  memory and processing power for PQ algorithms the switch from SHA-1 to
1223.46s - 1229.58s |  SHA-2 back in about 2017 caused a friend of mine in a previous job to complain a
1229.58s - 1235.06s |  lot about how it now took 10 minutes to create a key pair instead of the
1235.06s - 1239.94s |  five minutes that it used to how long with a post quantum safe signature take
1239.94s - 1244.26s |  to generate in an LIU I don't know that's that's gonna be interesting one
1244.26s - 1253.64s |  to do so I'm coming to the end here and I want to talk about a little bit about
1253.64s - 1260.84s |  the way ahead so the operator level some advice from the DSWG is to start
1260.84s - 1267.00s |  invent an inventory of all your PQI use cases and when NIST finally figures out
1267.00s - 1272.64s |  which algorithms we are good to use for which use case start identifying those
1272.64s - 1277.00s |  suitable algorithms for each one and then with the manufacturers and OEMs
1277.00s - 1279.36s |  we're going to figure out the embedded software challenge because that's a big
1279.36s - 1284.40s |  one if you've ever coded in C dealing with memory pointers and the
1284.40s - 1288.56s |  digital signature which was you know a few dozen kilobytes is now several
1288.56s - 1295.40s |  megabytes that's going to be fun and of course we need to do a lot of testing
1295.40s - 1299.96s |  regulator approval and it's not going to happen in the timeline we've got for
1299.96s - 1303.84s |  post-quantum computing to become a thing but we go threat so we're up
1303.84s - 1307.20s |  against it on that front I'm gonna be back in the village after this talk if
1307.20s - 1311.48s |  anyone's to come and talk about post-quantum PKI I'm all ears I'd love
1311.48s - 1316.40s |  to hear from any experts out there I can take that back to the DSWG and those and
1316.40s - 1320.52s |  maybe sound a little bit more intelligent than I usually do but yeah
1320.52s - 1323.68s |  or if you want to come back and talk PKI I'll be there for a little bit I've got
1323.68s - 1328.48s |  my lot I live in Chicago now so now I'm you know it's obligatory to become a
1328.52s - 1333.08s |  fan so I've got my lot if you want that too but yeah I've got a few moments for
1333.08s - 1345.90s |  questions I think crack it is light is bright thank you so gentlemen the front
1345.90s - 1365.14s |  and it's it's hard to say yes to that the reason being is that it's not
1365.14s - 1370.90s |  specifically covered in regulation a lot of this isn't actually it's actually
1370.90s - 1375.98s |  more to do with the manufacturers send down recommendations and instructions to
1375.98s - 1379.86s |  operators on how to do things and they also build things around a secure
1379.86s - 1384.50s |  framework they all have product security teams and they all do a lot of work they
1384.50s - 1387.70s |  can't share a lot of information with us except for these recommendations and
1387.70s - 1391.10s |  instructions right and the FAA is quite rightly said even if it's a
1391.10s - 1394.46s |  recommendation you implemented it as if it was an instruction right so that's
1394.46s - 1400.66s |  that's good and that's what we do so that signing of the logs coming off the
1400.66s - 1404.18s |  aircraft obviously is probably a part of that risk assessment that the
1404.18s - 1407.90s |  manufacturers have gone through because that is potentially safety related if
1407.90s - 1417.78s |  the logs are tampered with then either a required you know maintenance check or
1417.78s - 1421.14s |  job is not going to be done or it's gonna be done and it's not required
1421.14s - 1425.78s |  right and that's a problem so that's why they're signed so when they come off and
1425.78s - 1433.16s |  they're analyzed we're sure their integrity yeah good question yes sorry
1433.16s - 1449.76s |  Jackie's sorry so again with method a you just grab a new certificate and
1449.76s - 1460.72s |  carry on with method B you get a new certificate and re-sign everything yes
1460.72s - 1469.96s |  sir yeah yeah yeah I would say logs I mean all of it yeah yeah folk was a part
1469.96s - 1474.52s |  of that so for those who don't know focal data is engine related and
1474.52s - 1479.96s |  actually we don't decode that it goes to back to the engine manufacturers they
1479.96s - 1494.82s |  decode it and they're really nice they sell it back to us yeah as well yeah
1494.82s - 1499.14s |  all right I think I'm being kicked off stage and so like I said I'm in the
1499.14s - 1504.90s |  village you want to come and chat and you know share some a lot thanks
