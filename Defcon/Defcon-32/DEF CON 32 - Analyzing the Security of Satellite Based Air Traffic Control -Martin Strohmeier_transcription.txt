  "title": "DEF CON 32 - Analyzing the Security of Satellite Based Air Traffic Control -Martin Strohmeier",
  "description": "Automatic Dependent Surveillance \u2013 Contract (ADS-C) is a satellite-based aviation datalink application used to monitor aircraft in remote regions. It is a crucial method for air traffic control to track aircraft where other protocols such as ADS-B lack connectivity. Even though it has been conceived more than 30 years ago, and other legacy communication protocols in aviation have shown to be vulnerable, ADS-C\u2019s security has not been investigated so far in the literature. We conduct a first investigation to close this gap. First, we compile a comprehensive overview of the history, impact, and technical details of ADS-C and its lower layers. Second, we build two software-defined radio receivers in order to analyze over 120\u2019000 real-world ADS-C messages. We further illustrate ADS-C\u2019s lack of authentication by implementing an ADS-C transmitter, which is capable of generating and sending arbitrary ADS-C messages. Finally, we use the channel control offered through a software-defined ADS-C receiver and transmitter as a basis for an in-depth analysis of the protocol weaknesses of the ADS-C system. The found vulnerabilities range from passively tracking aircraft to actively altering the position of actual aircraft through attacks on the downlink and the uplink. We assess the difficulty and impact of these attacks and discuss potential countermeasures.\n\nWe will further look at satellite-based ADS-B receivers and discuss their security and how they relate to ADS-C.",

 Thanks, and welcome to my talk on analyzing the security of satellite-based air traffic control.
7.36s - 13.36s |  My name is Martin Strohmeyer. I work at the cyber defense campus, which is part of the
14.08s - 16.96s |  procurement agency and part of the Swiss Department of Defense.
18.88s - 27.36s |  So DEF CON and other conferences have a long range of talks about attacks on air traffic control.
28.08s - 31.84s |  It's obviously an interesting critical infrastructure.
34.16s - 38.72s |  If you are able to attack something, it could have potentially catastrophic consequences.
39.44s - 46.40s |  This is an overview of typical technologies, communications protocols that are being used by
47.60s - 51.84s |  commercial aircraft and other aircraft in flight.
51.84s - 62.08s |  And basically, since around the early 2010s, a lot of practical attacks on pretty much all of
62.08s - 70.16s |  these communication technologies in aviation have been shown and demonstrated. The principle
70.16s - 75.44s |  is always the same. You examine these standards, aviation standards, they are known, they're
75.44s - 83.60s |  available. There's no security, no authentication in them. You implement them, you build a receiver.
83.60s - 91.28s |  These might also be useful for enthusiasts, plane spotters, that stuff powers flight radar or flight
91.28s - 97.84s |  aware. But from a security perspective, if you have a receiver, it's also not difficult to
97.84s - 102.88s |  implement a sender or transmitter using software-defined radios. And when you do that,
102.88s - 108.24s |  you can do security analysis and you profit. And that's something that has been done for all of
108.24s - 115.92s |  these technologies, whether it's aircraft-aircraft, aircraft-ground, or also GPS is well known.
116.88s - 122.32s |  And since they all have no security built in, it's not difficult to attack them. It's quite obvious.
123.92s - 132.24s |  But a few technologies nicely fitting in with the aerospace topic have come up over the past
132.96s - 139.36s |  decade or so, where aircraft are talking to satellites and kind of trying to replace some
139.36s - 143.28s |  of these technologies or at least enhance them. So that's what this talk will be about.
144.48s - 152.80s |  Just a quick teaser. My colleagues will have a talk tomorrow on creative stage two, attacking
152.80s - 158.32s |  the collision avoidance system. So that was one of the last technologies that hadn't been
158.32s - 167.84s |  demonstrated from this whole overview. So tomorrow, 1415, that's your opportunity to
167.84s - 174.32s |  see a real attack on this as well. But this talk is about space-based air traffic control. So what
174.32s - 181.12s |  do we understand under that? There's two different technologies actually. One I'll touch on briefly
181.12s - 188.24s |  and one more in detail. First one is satellite ADS-B. And the second one is the so-called ADS
189.12s - 199.84s |  contract. So let's look at that. Satellite ADS-B. You all probably have heard of these ADS-B attacks.
199.84s - 206.08s |  There have been talks since 2010. People like RenderMan have had main stage talks
206.80s - 212.24s |  demonstrating the problem here. It's well known to be vulnerable. The terrestrial
212.96s - 219.68s |  transponder technology, aircraft sending data to the ground, trivial to receive,
220.24s - 227.84s |  send ghost aircraft, everything is possible. The problem is space-based ADS-B is essentially just
227.84s - 234.48s |  the same. Some companies have built constellations in low Earth orbit, and they're simply picking up
234.48s - 242.72s |  these same terrestrial signals and then giving them to air navigation service providers to
242.72s - 247.36s |  air traffic control. That is obviously helpful where you don't have terrestrial receivers,
247.36s - 253.84s |  so over the oceans or in mountainous areas. One of these providers, Aerion, also on the
253.84s - 261.20s |  homepage, they say, yeah, it's just ADS-B. There's nothing else here. What they however also said
261.68s - 275.12s |  when they went widely public with it, said, okay, we're 485 miles up in space. So you can't attack
275.12s - 280.48s |  that. It's not like somebody is attacking that signal. They could attack GPS, which they can,
280.48s - 284.24s |  and obviously is a widespread problem, and particularly over the past year now.
284.24s - 287.92s |  But they're not going to attack the actual terrestrial ADS-B signal.
288.88s - 295.36s |  500 miles up in space, too far away. At the time, we already thought, honestly,
295.36s - 300.48s |  there's bullshit. It's just an engineering problem. You need more power. You can do just the same.
301.28s - 306.64s |  They pick up the signals from aircraft flying 30,000 feet, 10 kilometers.
308.88s - 314.88s |  They pick that up in space, right? So what's 10 kilometers more sending from the ground? It's not
314.88s - 322.00s |  a problem, quite obviously. And yes, space is quite obviously not inherently secure.
322.00s - 328.48s |  We've seen this last year, latest last year here at Hackersat. Of course, you can communicate
328.48s - 335.12s |  with satellites in two way and attack them. I think there's no doubt about this.
338.13s - 345.09s |  And yeah, back then, at least we postulated a theoretic attack. We didn't actually send to their
345.09s - 353.01s |  satellites. Would not be legal. But we said, hey, here, these are kind of the requirements
353.01s - 360.13s |  that you have to think about relation, position relation to the aircraft and the satellites.
360.13s - 366.37s |  And then you can simply send ghost aircraft also to these satellites. Not a problem.
368.62s - 374.30s |  So very much possible. We haven't done it in practice for regulatory reasons, but
376.46s - 382.22s |  it's certainly not secure. There's no reason to believe so. That brings me to the second
382.22s - 389.74s |  technology, ADS-C, which is much less well known, I would say. It's been developed
390.94s - 397.90s |  already late 90s, but only become quite popular over the past five or 10 years. Also in the wake
397.90s - 405.74s |  of the MH-370 incident, tracking aircraft over oceans has become quite a popular topic.
407.26s - 413.10s |  So what does ADS-C or full name Automatic Dependent Surveillance contract actually do?
414.06s - 421.26s |  Well, it picks up aircraft information and sends it to air traffic service units, they call it,
421.26s - 426.06s |  which is basically ground stations. There are dozens or even hundreds around the world.
426.62s - 432.54s |  And this information includes aircraft position, altitude, speed, navigational intent,
433.18s - 438.30s |  metrological data. Of course, this is all very useful for air traffic control, air traffic
438.30s - 443.42s |  surveillance, route monitoring, in particular, if you're over the Atlantic or Pacific
443.42s - 450.75s |  and have no updates from your aircraft and where they are. This is roughly the setup.
452.91s - 460.35s |  Aircraft gets their position, of course, also from GNSS, GPS services. It then connects to
461.15s - 466.67s |  different types of satellites, typically geostationary satellites from Enmasat. But it
466.67s - 473.31s |  can also be actually LEO Constellations also offer these services. And then the satellites
473.31s - 479.87s |  forward the data to the ground, and there it's being routed to the air navigation service
479.87s - 489.55s |  provider who require that content. There's also VHF, HF version of all of this, but that's not
490.11s - 499.82s |  what we're looking at here. What's the purpose? I think I alluded to it. The goal is really to
499.82s - 506.06s |  enable aircraft monitoring in very remote areas. We don't have terrestrial surveillance of aircraft.
507.18s - 513.42s |  If you do that, if you know where the aircraft are, rather than just roughly estimating from,
513.42s - 519.98s |  you know, leaving US mainland towards Europe, after two hours, you might not really know where
519.98s - 525.74s |  they are anymore. If you know where they are, you can more efficiently utilize the airspace
525.74s - 531.10s |  because you can minimize separation between different aircraft. And the second effect,
532.70s - 537.34s |  you reduce the reliance on traditional voice communication between pilots and controllers.
537.98s - 543.90s |  These channels are quite congested, quite busy. And you can like this, if you put a lot of the
543.90s - 550.22s |  data on these digital satellite channels, you can use these for more urgent correspondence.
551.82s - 560.22s |  There's roughly comparison. This is a image from ASB exchange. And it shows roughly where you can
560.22s - 570.54s |  have crowdsourced terrestrial reception of aircraft signals. So by and large, that's
571.50s - 579.74s |  where a lot of people live. And also, a lot of, let's say, more wealthy people live who can put
579.74s - 586.70s |  up receivers on the ground and feed it to the systems. All of the red areas, you will never
586.70s - 595.74s |  have any, any reception, any surveillance of aircraft. So if we overlay this with ADC coverage,
595.74s - 603.02s |  we can see that this sort of satellite coverage fills in a lot of the red gaps, certainly
603.02s - 610.86s |  Pacific, Atlantic, even Indian Ocean, and also partly you can see over Africa and some other
611.90s - 616.54s |  terrestrial areas. So how does ADC actually work?
616.54s - 623.02s |  Let's look first at uplink and then downlink messages.
624.78s - 631.50s |  Basically, ADC, they initiate the connection always. So they request a certain aircraft
631.50s - 638.62s |  that's flying to provide them with a so-called contract that can either be periodic.
639.90s - 644.86s |  With that sort of periodic contract, you maybe get regular updates every 10 minutes or so
645.42s - 650.06s |  of position, altitude, and the other information they want, or they can ask for certain events.
651.02s - 658.86s |  So for example, when they want a waypoint change, so when aircraft is flying towards
658.86s - 663.90s |  a certain waypoint, and they know that, and they can request a change of that waypoint
663.90s - 673.50s |  through these contracts. That's roughly how the message is looking, but I won't get into detail
673.50s - 679.02s |  here. And then we have the probably more interesting downlink part. So this is where
679.02s - 687.42s |  the aircraft answers with ADC reports, which go to the air traffic control service provider.
688.06s - 693.82s |  The aircraft sends, as I said, for example, periodic updates, position everything every 10
693.82s - 703.34s |  minutes, or in these events, if change events, cases, it sends certain reports regarding that.
704.38s - 709.26s |  Again, that's what the messages look like. They will include position, latitude, longitude,
709.26s - 715.26s |  altitude, some timestamp, and then depending on the type of the report, it will include some more
715.26s - 723.66s |  information. So why is all that important? I slightly alluded to this already. If we don't
723.66s - 729.66s |  have this kind of new modern technology, the air traffic controllers will have to rely on
729.66s - 737.02s |  pre-computed aircraft trajectories, roughly guesstimating where the aircraft is, which is
737.02s - 742.38s |  not so great for surveillance. And they will use voice communication, just the same finding out
742.38s - 748.70s |  where the aircraft is and what they're doing, in particular in remote areas, using HF and the
748.70s - 756.54s |  likes. And that's not the most precise technology or the most available one. So in short, ADC is
756.54s - 763.10s |  very crucial for aircraft monitoring these areas. It's being rolled out, as we've seen on the map,
763.10s - 770.38s |  quite a lot of commercial aircraft have it now and use it. And in contrast to many of the other
770.38s - 776.30s |  technologies that were in the earlier slides, this hasn't been studied at all. Not in terms
776.30s - 783.66s |  of use cases, really, in the scientific community, but also in the security community in terms of,
783.66s - 791.15s |  well, what can we do with it? What can we do against it? So what about security?
792.43s - 797.55s |  There's a paper on this, on what I'm going to say. So we talked about this at this year's
798.43s - 804.91s |  SpaceX workshop already. But if you prefer it in written form, you can look it up.
805.55s - 812.67s |  But I cover most of this in the following slides. So that's our system model and our
812.67s - 819.39s |  threat model. Basically, we have the satellite in the middle, we have the ground earth station,
819.39s - 825.79s |  as they call it, and we have the aircraft earth station, which might sound a bit weird, but
825.79s - 830.43s |  you know, aircraft is still on the earth while a satellite is not. So that's why they call it
831.47s - 836.11s |  that way. Different frequencies that we have to look at. So the aircraft
837.23s - 842.11s |  uses the 1.6 gigahertz frequency to talk to the satellite. And then there's a different up and
842.11s - 847.87s |  down in frequency from the satellite to the ground station, 3.6 gigahertz and 6.5 gigahertz.
848.59s - 853.87s |  And we have three different types of attackers that we consider. First one is a passive attacker,
853.87s - 860.91s |  you could also call it an eavesdropper. The eavesdropper simply needs to be in range of the
860.91s - 867.07s |  whole satellite beam of the geostationary satellite. So that's not very complicated.
867.63s - 875.07s |  But we have realized that at least in Europe, you need to be in a 5g free zone to listen to
875.07s - 882.43s |  the downlink because the 3.6 gigahertz area frequency is exactly at least in Europe, the 5g
882.43s - 889.39s |  frequency or one of the 5g frequencies. And if you have one of these transmitters, ground stations
889.39s - 895.87s |  nearby, you will not be able to receive the very weak satellite signals. So that was an issue that
895.87s - 902.67s |  we had to contend with. Then we have two active attackers. One is attacking the downlink. So
902.67s - 910.43s |  basically, transmitting the same data as we see on the downlink towards the earth station. And
910.43s - 916.51s |  an uplink attacker. So somebody who sends to the satellite, which is more complicated, absolutely,
916.51s - 923.79s |  you need more power. And we've been speaking to some experts, depending on the satellite setup,
924.75s - 931.63s |  there may be some beam forming going on. So you might, it might not be sufficient to stay in
932.75s - 937.47s |  just anywhere in the satellite beam, you may also need to be close to a ground station,
937.47s - 944.83s |  depending on the satellite setup. So let's go through it one by one. What can we do with
944.83s - 950.75s |  eavesdropping on ADC messages, the content we've seen is mostly position waypoints.
951.55s - 957.71s |  And there's some meta information such as the aircraft ID, some identifiers. And
958.99s - 966.67s |  mostly this is useful for reconnaissance on aircraft. So you know where they are,
966.67s - 973.39s |  you know what they sent, you know where they're going, that is quite nice. Can be used for
974.43s - 979.95s |  attacks on aircraft, also on other protocols, or for active attacks on ADC itself.
980.83s - 987.79s |  We can link these identifiers to databases that are available online. And then from there,
988.67s - 994.11s |  you may imagine a lot of privacy violations. I'm sure you've seen all the kerfuffle about people
994.67s - 1002.03s |  tracking Elon Musk or Taylor Swift's aircraft, right? If you haven't, then I can recommend my
1002.03s - 1008.83s |  talk, the village last year. I think it's just been put online last week. So you can find it
1008.83s - 1020.90s |  on YouTube. Let's move on towards the active attacks first on the uplink. And here, mostly
1020.90s - 1026.58s |  what you can do is different sorts of denial of service attacks. So if we look at the protocol
1026.58s - 1034.34s |  here, the aircraft locks on, it will be confirmed, it will be acknowledged. And of course, if you
1034.34s - 1042.98s |  attack this handshake, then you might simply be able to prevent the lock on. And then there's no
1042.98s - 1051.62s |  ADC connection. That's, yeah, it's a denial of service of ADC. You have other technologies
1051.62s - 1058.58s |  available, of course. So it's not immediately safety relevant at all. But it's certainly an
1058.58s - 1065.86s |  attack. And there are several places in the protocol where you can do this. On the downlink
1065.86s - 1073.86s |  end, it gets a bit more interesting. Here, you can do spoofing of aircraft positions towards the,
1074.58s - 1082.50s |  or yeah, towards the air traffic control provider. What you can't do, just to preface this,
1083.30s - 1090.90s |  is to inject ghost aircraft. Why? Because as we've seen earlier, the air traffic controller
1090.90s - 1097.46s |  always initiates the connection to an aircraft. So they will do that towards an aircraft they
1097.46s - 1105.54s |  know is already flying. And if they get a response, okay, great. But if they get a response from an
1105.54s - 1110.10s |  aircraft they haven't initiated a connection with, it will just be discarded and ignored.
1110.90s - 1115.78s |  If, however, they already have a connection, then it's absolutely possible to send different
1115.78s - 1121.06s |  positions than the one from the aircraft. And we've illustrated this here with our own setups.
1121.06s - 1129.14s |  So on the left, we have real aircraft positions that we received. And you can just send, you know,
1129.14s - 1134.26s |  for the same aircraft, 10 positions clustering together, and it would be displayed this way.
1135.06s - 1141.30s |  Likewise, you can flood ground stations with emergency mode messages from basically all the
1141.30s - 1146.82s |  existing aircraft that they have a contract with. That's the picture of the flight management system
1146.82s - 1152.18s |  here. That's where the pilot can put this on. And then, of course, they will be flagged with
1152.18s - 1160.18s |  the air traffic controller and get priority, get certain routines set up. And here, you can
1161.14s - 1167.22s |  basically do this for all the aircraft at the same time, which would again be causing some chaos and
1167.22s - 1175.78s |  some denial of service. We've done some real world evaluation as far as that is legally possible.
1177.30s - 1182.74s |  That's our receiver setup. So we've both set up downlink and uplink receivers.
1184.90s - 1189.46s |  The pipelines for the receivers are available online on GitHub,
1190.90s - 1197.46s |  having a later slide. But mostly, you can download it, put it together with your software
1197.46s - 1202.90s |  defined radios and antennas. Then you have to look, follow tutorials, look at the channels,
1202.90s - 1208.82s |  and you can receive the data. You have to look, check also which satellite is in your area.
1208.82s - 1217.30s |  So this is the InMarsat coverage of the geo satellites. So for us, it would be the AlphaSat.
1217.30s - 1223.14s |  If we look at it in Europe, in the US, you would get different satellites and their aircraft
1223.14s - 1230.50s |  connections. That's the pipeline, the setup. Definitely credit to all these people who
1230.50s - 1238.02s |  have written the super interesting, super useful receiver software, SDR receiver,
1238.02s - 1244.34s |  Jero, and a lot of tutorials. You set the whole thing up, save the data, and analyze it. That's
1244.34s - 1251.38s |  what we did. That's how these setups look like. The uplink, much easier, as you see, can be a
1251.38s - 1259.78s |  super small antenna on the left. For the downlink, you need something in the eight feet dish size.
1259.78s - 1266.90s |  So your house might be, you might have to have a decent sized garden for this.
1268.42s - 1274.18s |  Some data insights. We just looked at this for a few weeks, collected a lot of messages. You see
1274.18s - 1282.34s |  the black points, which are the positions here, 2,500 aircraft, communicating with 50, 60 ground
1282.34s - 1288.26s |  stations. If you want to see more on this, other people are collecting the data as well. So tbg
1288.26s - 1298.50s |  airframes.io, you always get the last two days. These are typical routes that you can follow with
1298.50s - 1307.30s |  that setup. Then, as I've mentioned, we arrested, we built a transmitter. And it works. It's a
1307.30s - 1312.10s |  straightforward student work, building a transmitter from a receiver from all of these
1312.82s - 1321.78s |  existing SDR implementations. We tested it. It's fairly binary. We set up our own ground station.
1322.34s - 1329.94s |  We tested the transmitter, can generate arbitrary messages on ADC, including all of the sub layers.
1330.66s - 1335.06s |  So we injected these messages into our dish, into our ground stations.
1335.70s - 1343.22s |  And lo and behold, it works. So if you have a receiver software ADC, you can simply inject
1344.02s - 1349.86s |  any legitimately looking message and you cannot tell it apart from the messages that we get from
1349.86s - 1358.48s |  an aircraft. That brings me to the conclusion of my talk today. I hope I could explain that
1358.48s - 1364.16s |  satellite edge of control certainly helps increase airspace efficiency in many areas.
1364.72s - 1371.36s |  Unfortunately, security was never a concern. There's no authentication, which is as problematic
1371.36s - 1379.76s |  in space as on the ground. Passive attackers can eavesdrop and follow aircraft, do whatever
1380.64s - 1385.92s |  what may they might find interesting with it. And you can follow a lot of aircraft just with
1385.92s - 1391.92s |  a single receiver, which is nice. Active attackers can inject signals and disrupt
1391.92s - 1400.00s |  air traffic control to a certain extent. And the resources certainly are quite straightforward or
1400.00s - 1407.92s |  trivial. So it's basically a master thesis here. Student can do this and set up costs for
1408.80s - 1416.88s |  the transmitters are a few hundred euros. So not a problem. That's it for me. Just another teaser.
1417.52s - 1425.44s |  We have some, if you're interested in injection of signals into satellite dishes,
1426.32s - 1432.88s |  there's also a talk on the DEFCON main stage tomorrow, track three, breaking the beam at 2.15.
1433.60s - 1438.56s |  And next week at USENIX security, the paper is online under this link. So
1439.12s - 1441.84s |  just I hope I could do this as well. Thank you.
