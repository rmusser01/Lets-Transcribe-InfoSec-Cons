Probably stealing hundreds of millions of dollars in diamonds, gold, and cash from one of the world's most formidable vaults. In 2003, a team of thieves did just that. Armed with hairspray, double sided tape, and nerves of steel, these thieves defeated layer after layer of security to pull off the haul of a lifetime.\n\nHowever, as much as this is a story of skilled criminals, it is every bit as much a story of security failures and the parallels between protecting diamonds and data.

0.05s - 5.05s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 And with that, the stage is yours. Alright, awesome. Alright, perfect. Uh, can everybody
7.95s - 12.95s |  hear me okay? Excellent. Okay. I got that. That was good. Uh, awesome. Uh, so my name is Pete
15.79s - 22.53s |  Stegmaier. Uh, this is a treasure trove of failures. What history's greatest heist can teach
22.53s - 28.33s |  us about defense in depth. Uh, who am I? Uh, I'm Pete Stegmaier. You're probably tired of
28.33s - 33.55s |  hearing that by now. I'm kind of tired of saying it. Uh, I've been a senior security engineer
33.55s - 38.55s |  for seven years. Uh, in addition to that, I am a heist expert and it feels really douchey to
40.99s - 47.13s |  say that. Uh, it's true though. Uh, History Channel, Vice, uh, National Geographic have all
47.13s - 52.09s |  called me up and asked for like consultations. I've done, uh, history's greatest heist with
52.09s - 58.27s |  Pierce Brosnan, uh, as an expert. Uh, and I had a podcast and a book, uh, also about a bunch
58.27s - 63.27s |  of different heists. Um, so today I wanted to talk about my favorite heist and the parallels
65.87s - 72.45s |  between a real world attack and, uh, something that we can do in the digital world and how we
72.45s - 80.23s |  can either defend against that or exploit it depending on why you're here. Alright, so, uh,
80.27s - 84.87s |  we're gonna be talking about the Antwerp Diamond Heist. Uh, this happened, uh, between
84.87s - 89.87s |  February 15th and 16th in February of 2003. Uh, Antwerp, Belgium. Uh, this was pulled off
92.15s - 96.75s |  by the school of Turin. Uh, we're just gonna do a little bit of like details about everything
96.75s - 102.29s |  first and then we'll get into the process. And what ended up being stolen was between a
102.29s - 107.29s |  hundred million and a billion dollars worth of, uh, diamonds, gold, jewels, stocks,
110.43s - 116.07s |  uh, and the reason that there is a 900 million dollar range is because what was targeted
116.07s - 120.77s |  was actually safety deposit boxes and a lot of times people don't like to claim what they
120.77s - 126.21s |  have in there. So there's no way of actually knowing. And the reason that this, uh,
126.21s - 131.29s |  happened, believe it or not, like the team, the thieves were very talented, but it would
131.29s - 136.79s |  not have been possible without just a cascade of failures on behalf of the security team as
136.79s - 141.23s |  well. Uh, so we're gonna go ahead and start getting into that. Uh, first let's set the scene
141.23s - 147.23s |  with the Diamond Center itself. This is actually, uh, this is kind of like a nested
147.23s - 153.07s |  facility. Uh, so the Antwerp Diamond Center handles 80 percent of global diamond
153.07s - 158.91s |  transactions. Uh, so it's a pretty, pretty major throw point, uh, for anybody to try to
158.91s - 163.95s |  attack and because of that a lot of people thought that it was too big to attack. Uh, it is
163.95s - 169.99s |  in the most secure part of Antwerp. They have a dedicated private police force as well
169.99s - 175.13s |  as a local police force located just outside the facility. Uh, and because this is like
175.13s - 181.53s |  basically a neighborhood in Antwerp, um, in addition to having all that policing, they
181.53s - 186.27s |  also had, uh, a way to control traffic. So like a traffic control point, uh, with those
186.27s - 190.45s |  little car catchers, the little hydraulic spikes that come up, so they could literally
190.45s - 194.89s |  control all of the cars coming in and out of this controlled area. And then there were
194.89s - 199.99s |  multiple blocks of this Diamond Center, um, where different offices and different jewelers
199.99s - 203.89s |  could rent office space and things like that. So there were actually three buildings, A, B,
203.89s - 210.81s |  and C block. Uh, and let's get to the vault. Uh, I tried real hard to do like the Ocean's
210.81s - 217.45s |  Eleven, George Clooney, real smooth, like, uh, I, I can't do it. And I, like, they said
217.45s - 220.35s |  something about copyright. I'm kind of scared. I don't want this taken down. So we're just
220.35s - 225.35s |  going to describe this vault and I am not George Clooney. Um, so the first, uh, this vault
227.73s - 234.19s |  is a marvel of engineering. Um, it's my favorite vault. Uh, it's weird to have one, but this
234.19s - 240.23s |  is it. Uh, and it's got some really, it's got ten different security features baked into it.
240.23s - 245.25s |  Um, number one is a combination lock or a combination dial with a hundred million
245.25s - 250.25s |  possible combinations. Uh, it is a foot thick of solid steel and there is a 12 inch long key
253.65s - 257.83s |  that actually gets separated into two different parts. So there's like the stick part and then
257.83s - 263.83s |  the actual teeth, uh, or the comb of the, uh, the key. Then there's a day gate. So if you
263.83s - 269.33s |  open up that first gate, there's still, you know, another, uh, another door stopping you.
269.33s - 274.81s |  There's a magnetic sensor that detects if the door is opened. So if that magnetic field
274.83s - 281.71s |  breaks, it triggers an alarm. There is a guard, uh, or a guard shack and there's cameras like
281.71s - 288.05s |  watching the vault. There's an access card reader, seismic detector, so you can't, you can't
288.05s - 293.05s |  tunnel in. There is a combination motion and thermal sensor, uh, that because they had a lot
295.79s - 302.59s |  of false positives would only set off if it detected both extra temperature and motion. So
302.67s - 307.21s |  if it just got a little warm, not going to set it off. If like a mouse is running around, not
307.21s - 311.79s |  going to set it off. But if there's a person, they're warm enough and shaky enough to, to make
311.79s - 318.05s |  that happen. And then finally there are the safe deposit boxes themselves. Um, these are
318.05s - 323.07s |  pretty standard, although, uh, the owners of the box were given the opportunity to replace, uh,
325.93s - 331.93s |  basically what was a plastic plate behind, uh, the keyhole with a steel plate. And so some
331.97s - 339.05s |  people chose to update, uh, to that steel plate. Some people chose to, uh, you know, not patch
339.05s - 345.66s |  everything. And, uh, I'll let you guess which ones got hit later. That said, I mean, don't
345.66s - 350.66s |  patch everything like right away. Like maybe, like we learned that this week too. So, uh, so
353.50s - 359.84s |  this is, um, since we're all, uh, mostly tech people here, uh, this is basically just a very
359.84s - 365.28s |  poorly colored, uh, in retrospect diagram of what we're looking at. And I just wanted to
365.28s - 369.72s |  make this look like a network so you can kind of see the different layers of security and how
369.72s - 374.72s |  it would relate to the, uh, to the cloud. So over here we've got the world itself. And then
376.52s - 380.10s |  we've got our access point here, which is the car catches at the gateways into that
380.10s - 386.04s |  neighborhood. Uh, in there we've got the actual diamond center building. And then within
386.04s - 390.74s |  there is another series of access control points like, uh, an elevator that can take you
390.74s - 396.22s |  down to the antechamber below the ground for the vault. Um, you know, badge readers,
396.22s - 402.12s |  guards, things like that. And all of those security, uh, controls allow you access to the
402.12s - 407.12s |  vault. So it is kind of like a system in that. And it would be a really bad system design if,
409.30s - 414.70s |  you know, I don't know, somebody put a open port on this part, uh, that connected to the
414.72s - 417.96s |  world and then it just kind of had a tunnel to the vault, like that would be really bad and
417.96s - 422.96s |  nobody would do that, right? Alright, well that's my talk, so. Uh, alright. Uh, so this, this
426.08s - 430.14s |  heist was actually pulled off by a group called the School of Terran. Uh, that is not an
430.14s - 435.34s |  official name, that is a name that was given to them by the police. Uh, it is also not an
435.34s - 440.36s |  accredited school. Uh, this is a, uh, this is a group of highly specialized thieves that work
440.42s - 447.12s |  in a collective and they kind of refer each other, uh, to jobs based on the skill sets
447.12s - 451.26s |  required. So somebody might say, hey, I want to rob this Arby's. And you're going to say,
451.26s - 456.76s |  great, we need a safe guy, we need somebody with zero taste buds, we can make this happen. I
456.76s - 462.38s |  don't know why I said that, I love Arby's, please. Uh, anyways. Sorry, I'm going off on
462.38s - 468.28s |  tangents here. Um, yeah, they referred each other based on the skills that they needed, but
468.30s - 473.54s |  they were usually organized by, you know, specific masterminds. And in this case, that
473.54s - 478.54s |  mastermind was named Leonardo, Leonardo Noturbitarlo. Um, the other thing that this, uh,
480.48s - 485.92s |  group of thieves was great at was nicknames. Uh, so his was the mastermind, but there was
485.92s - 491.26s |  also the monster, uh, who was like damn near seven feet tall. Uh, he specialized in like
491.26s - 496.26s |  alarms. There was the genius who also specialized in alarms and electronics. The king of
497.02s - 504.02s |  keys, which is just the coolest name I've ever heard of in my life. And then speedy, because
504.02s - 511.47s |  sometimes you run out of budget. Alright, so, how do we plan this heist? Same way that we're
511.47s - 516.47s |  going to try and attack a network, right? So, you got to start with recon. So, 18 months
518.61s - 524.75s |  prior to the heist, uh, Noturbitarlo just walks up to the office space and rents an office. He
524.77s - 528.97s |  says, oh, I've got a jewel company. I'd like to get a safety deposit box. And they said,
528.97s - 534.91s |  great, you can stay here as long as you like. Uh, had they run a background check on him,
534.91s - 539.65s |  they would have known that he was like, he didn't even like change his name. He'd been
539.65s - 544.65s |  arrested many times. Many times. And they're like, yeah, we'll, we'll just give you an
547.55s - 553.69s |  access card to the, to the safety deposit box, to the vault. You're good to go. And so he
553.73s - 559.01s |  starts by establishing persistence. He goes there multiple times a week and he'll just hang
559.01s - 565.05s |  out in his office. He'll go down to the safe. Uh, he wore like hidden cameras in his pockets
565.05s - 571.29s |  and in his duffel bag so that he could start mapping this stuff out. And then, after he'd
571.29s - 574.95s |  kind of gleaned all the information that he could on that first run, he decides to try to
574.95s - 579.53s |  escalate his privileges a little bit and get, you know, a higher level of clearance by
579.53s - 584.87s |  renting a larger office space. And so he says, hey, you know, I want to give you guys more
584.87s - 588.97s |  money for some more floor space. Uh, can I see some floor plans just so I could pick out the
588.97s - 595.15s |  appropriate office? And they said, sure thing. Here's the blueprints for the entire
595.15s - 603.84s |  organization. Yeah. Uh, so, for those of you who keep track at home, that's least
603.84s - 610.66s |  privilege. Uh, and while he was going over, uh, going over the, uh, the schematics, he saw
614.90s - 619.90s |  two fatal flaws. Number one was a door in the parking garage that just opened out to the
622.70s - 628.48s |  street. That thing that we said couldn't possibly happen, it happened. And then from that
628.48s - 634.82s |  garage, there was a stairwell that took you down into the antechamber past the elevator.
634.84s - 641.86s |  So, you could just bypass, like, most of the access controls and be right in the vault room. I
641.86s - 647.16s |  sure hope they fired that guy. Uh, but as they were, as they were, like, you know, using their
647.16s - 651.90s |  cameras and figuring things out, uh, the school of Turin did something that I think is pretty,
651.90s - 657.54s |  pretty incredible. Uh, they built a replica vault. Uh, some of these guys, the genius
657.54s - 662.04s |  particularly, owned a security company. Uh, so he was able to get, like, the exact, like,
662.06s - 667.06s |  motion detectors and, uh, basically they were able to build a complete replica of this vault, and
669.60s - 674.84s |  they started practicing being able to open it in the dark. Uh, they got some safety deposit
674.84s - 682.50s |  boxes, and they basically just built a network that they could start running scripts in.
682.50s - 689.39s |  Alright, so now we gotta plan this thing. Hold on, I'm just gonna grab a drink. Whew, thirsty.
689.57s - 696.33s |  Alright. So, if you're gonna rob a diamond, uh, center, best time to do it is Valentine's Day
699.87s - 707.23s |  weekend. That's uh, and this time worked out for a lot of reasons. Number one, Valentine's Day
707.23s - 712.19s |  weekend. Either they just sold a lot of diamonds, or they have a bunch of unsold diamonds
712.19s - 716.73s |  sitting in that safe. So, there's extra cash, extra diamonds, because everybody's up in their
716.73s - 721.75s |  inventory. The next thing that made this particular weekend a really good time, was Serena
724.01s - 730.55s |  Williams was doing an exhibition tennis match across town, so all of the police were busy,
730.55s - 735.35s |  like, controlling traffic for that, because she was a big draw. Uh, so they, they just did the
735.35s - 740.37s |  Die Hard 4. Uh, and then also, it was a bank holiday, so there was a long weekend there, and the
741.05s - 747.35s |  president of the, uh, diamond exchange was getting married that week, so all of the
747.35s - 752.35s |  executives were at that. So, nobody's coming back to the office. Uh, and this, this timing, by
754.45s - 759.73s |  the way, if you're familiar with the Bank of Bangladesh heist, uh, or, uh, hack, they kinda
759.73s - 764.17s |  did the same thing. They were able to line up, I believe an Islamic holiday, uh, a national
764.17s - 769.57s |  holiday in the states, and basically made sure that nobody was gonna be checking those logs
769.57s - 775.71s |  for at least 3 days. So, picking a time like that is super great if you're, you know, a thief
775.71s - 780.95s |  or trying to find the right time to attack, but if you're looking to defend your networks,
780.95s - 785.69s |  don't just think about, like, hey guys, long weekend. You know, make sure that there are
785.69s - 792.19s |  systems in place, you know, so this doesn't happen. They did have a security guard that was
792.19s - 795.73s |  supposed to be there, uh, he took the night off just because he was getting drunk with his
795.73s - 803.45s |  brother. So, next, uh, we've got our final prep work before the heist. So, 5 days before, the
806.33s - 811.79s |  genius just takes Notre Bartolo's access card, swipes in because there was no other form of
811.79s - 817.91s |  authentication, if you had the key card, you were fine, and he actually goes into the vault
817.91s - 822.91s |  in the evening and starts testing a, uh, a way to, uh, bypass that magnetic sensor. Uh, and
823.91s - 831.21s |  that's, that's a pretty advanced system and he solves it with like $20 worth of stuff, uh,
831.21s - 835.41s |  which I just love. That's, that's part of the reason this is my favorite. It's like, just, they
835.41s - 840.43s |  did really cool stuff. Don't do it, but like, don't, don't not do it. Uh, so, and we're gonna,
842.99s - 848.67s |  I'll show you that in a, in a little bit here. Uh, 3 days before the heist, uh, and by the way,
848.69s - 853.33s |  they almost got caught 5 days out when he was trying to leave and then he just turned around
853.33s - 858.17s |  and slept in the office because he saw security guards like checking IDs. And nobody thought
858.17s - 863.17s |  that that was weird. Um, so, 3 days before the heist, uh, Notre Bartolo is going into the safe
865.97s - 870.91s |  again to just, you know, conduct his business and make sure everything is still looking, you
870.91s - 877.35s |  know, good for a heisting. And he places a hidden camera over the vault door. And this is
877.37s - 882.11s |  gonna give them a view of the combination. So, when somebody goes to open it, they can
882.11s - 887.11s |  hopefully, you know, see those numbers. The 100 million possible combinations. This is my
889.19s - 894.19s |  favorite part. The day before the heist, uh, right before, uh, right before closing, Notre
896.33s - 901.33s |  Bartolo takes out a bottle of hairspray and he sprays the heat and motion sensor with a light
901.75s - 906.75s |  film of hairspray that basically just disrupted it enough to not notice the increase in heat
909.23s - 914.23s |  right away. And so, because of that, it could detect motion and they bought themselves a few
915.87s - 920.87s |  extra minutes before the heat was hot enough to, to go ahead and do that. Uh, just honestly
923.77s - 928.41s |  genius. And then they got themselves a nice sandwich plate. That's gonna come into play
928.43s - 936.06s |  later. But always like, if you're gonna do a crime, like, eat up. Alright, so we're at the day
936.06s - 941.24s |  of the heist now. They enter through the garage, just like that, uh, problem in the
941.24s - 946.38s |  schematics showed them to do. Uh, they started taking like crown royal bags and covering all
946.38s - 952.18s |  the cameras because they knew exactly where those were as well. Um, this device here, if you
952.18s - 957.36s |  can see it on the, the right hand side of the slide, it's basically just an aluminum plate
957.38s - 962.88s |  that he stuck two sided tape on. So it had a magnet, it had two sided tape, and then
962.88s - 969.46s |  basically he just unscrewed the bolts so that when he took the, the whole sensor off the door,
969.46s - 975.94s |  it stayed together. And it never broke that magnetic seal because they were taped together.
975.94s - 980.94s |  So, doesn't matter how smart your system is, something stupid can and will beat it. Um, so
981.16s - 986.16s |  the next thing they do is they open the vault door and they turn the lights off because
989.56s - 994.56s |  there are the, uh, light detectors in there. And then the genius basically, he takes like a
996.86s - 1003.30s |  styrofoam cooler and puts it over the heat sensor. So this is gonna block motion and it's
1003.30s - 1008.48s |  gonna insulate the temperature, so now that's out of the way. Uh, the seven foot tall guy
1008.52s - 1014.02s |  disables the alarm on the top of the garage, uh, on the top of the safe. And then they go to
1014.02s - 1019.90s |  actually get the keys themselves. Now bear in mind, I said before, this is a, uh, two foot
1019.90s - 1024.90s |  long, or a foot long key kept in two different spots. Except, it's not. They just put it in
1027.90s - 1035.89s |  the coat closet next to the safe door and they didn't take it apart. Oh, if you like that,
1035.89s - 1040.89s |  just, here we go. The combination lock, you know, the hundred million combinations, turns
1043.77s - 1048.57s |  out, that's as much of a pain in the ass for a thief to figure out as it is for the security
1048.57s - 1056.16s |  guy. So when he closed the vault that night, he just didn't spin the lock. Yeah. Sometimes
1061.27s - 1065.47s |  your man on the inside doesn't even realize that he's on the inside. He doesn't know
1065.47s - 1072.52s |  anything. And then they just open the, uh, the day gate with a crowbar. Cause sometimes the
1072.52s - 1077.52s |  classics work. So, this is the hall. Of the hundred and sixty safe, uh, deposit boxes, a
1082.36s - 1087.36s |  hundred and twenty three of them got looted. Uh, including Notre Bartolo's own. Um, I, I like
1091.00s - 1095.80s |  to think that he was just doing it to like blend in, but in reality he was probably just too
1095.82s - 1101.50s |  cheap to get the new plate. Because the, the only boxes that weren't opened with that tool, uh,
1101.50s - 1106.40s |  that basically just snapped the back plate off to open the lock, was the ones where they spent
1106.40s - 1111.40s |  the extra twenty dollars to upgrade to the steel plate. That's your stuff. Don't, don't be
1115.04s - 1120.04s |  cheap when it comes to like keeping your diamonds safe. They stole so much stuff that they
1120.12s - 1125.12s |  had to start like prioritizing and they left like tens of millions of dollars worth of diamonds
1127.16s - 1133.53s |  and cash just on the floor because it was too heavy. Hashtag goals. Once they were done, and
1137.72s - 1143.36s |  this, this heist by the way lasted three days. Um, yeah, because everybody was gone, they just
1143.36s - 1151.28s |  kept coming back and stealing more stuff. And nobody figured like, hey, like, maybe I should
1151.28s - 1155.26s |  like check the vault, make sure nobody stole the money. It's weird, but like, you know, it's
1155.26s - 1161.76s |  a thing I should check. They didn't, they just didn't do it. Uh, and then also, um, the, the
1161.76s - 1165.94s |  diamond center themselves, like after the heist was finally completed, they're like, oh, we
1165.94s - 1170.44s |  gotta go grab those videotapes. So they went up to the second story guard shack where the tapes
1170.44s - 1176.44s |  were and they just removed, they just took them out of the VCR. That's right, they were still
1176.44s - 1182.88s |  using, uh, VHS tapes because they didn't want to spend the extra money on DVRs. So had they,
1182.88s - 1186.98s |  you know, not done that, or had they updated it, we would have caught these people a lot
1186.98s - 1196.72s |  sooner, but they decided, you know, who's going to break into the vault? Alright, so now we
1196.72s - 1201.72s |  get to kind of the, uh, the fun part where everything falls apart. They get away initially
1202.66s - 1207.66s |  about two hours into the drive, uh, back to Italy where all these guys were from, Speedy, the
1210.66s - 1215.66s |  discount henchman starts freaking out. He's never flown this close to the sun before. And so
1217.86s - 1224.04s |  he starts like just throwing trash out of the window of their getaway car. I'm going to say
1224.04s - 1229.04s |  this right now, rule number one of performing a crime, only do one crime at a time.
1233.53s - 1241.09s |  Like, like if you got a Monet in your backseat, do the speed limit. That's all I'm saying. Uh,
1245.33s - 1249.81s |  Speedy though, he started freaking out and he just pulls over and he's like, we got to burn
1249.81s - 1254.41s |  this evidence because they had like trash bags full of evidence. So I guess rule two would be
1254.41s - 1259.75s |  don't drive with trash bags full of incriminating evidence. I shouldn't have to say that
1259.77s - 1266.47s |  one. Uh, but yeah, they, they basically, he started panicking and he started trying to burn
1266.47s - 1271.17s |  all of the evidence in a, in a burn barrel. And when he realized that wasn't going to happen,
1271.17s - 1277.91s |  he just kind of dumped it on the side of the road. And then in a, a weird fun twist of fate,
1277.91s - 1283.89s |  the exact spot that he picked, uh, to dump his trash was the spot where like an old
1283.89s - 1289.19s |  curmudgeonly farmer had just kept calling the police because of the dang kids who were also
1289.19s - 1297.56s |  dumping trash there. It was like, it was just like a good spot for trash. And so he, he's like,
1297.56s - 1301.46s |  oh, these kids, like they did the trash again. And so the police are like, sure, Harold. And
1301.46s - 1304.84s |  then they start going out there and they start seeing envelopes that say Antwerp Diamond
1304.84s - 1309.84s |  Center. And like pieces of videotape from the, the cameras and diamonds. They threw away
1312.38s - 1317.38s |  diamonds. They also found some half eaten sandwiches. And from the sandwiches, this is my
1320.20s - 1325.20s |  favorite part, they were able to start like looking through security camera footage and they saw
1328.08s - 1334.38s |  like the receipt was purchased like from a shop next to the diamond center. And then they saw
1334.38s - 1338.02s |  the, the camera footage of that and they're like, who's this weird seven foot tall guy
1338.02s - 1344.50s |  buying a bunch of sandwiches? So another rule, delete your cookies. That's the one I'm
1345.44s - 1353.96s |  going to do this for. Oh, thank you. Alright. So the other thing that happened after this is
1363.53s - 1370.53s |  Notre Bartolo, this is too dark, that was just a gag. Notre Bartolo, he decides in what might be
1370.53s - 1374.97s |  the dumbest move I've ever seen. He's like, you know what I'm going to do on Monday? I'm
1374.97s - 1380.45s |  going to show up back to the office, be like, what happened? And you know, play it like, like
1380.45s - 1385.45s |  an innocent man would do. Don't do that. If you escape the country, don't go back. Don't,
1388.19s - 1393.19s |  like, but he did that and then the police were kind of there waiting for him already. And then
1393.19s - 1397.63s |  they went to his apartment that he rented in town and they found a bunch of, uh, what's
1397.63s - 1402.33s |  called pointer emeralds stuck in his carpet. Those are like the little tiny emeralds that
1402.33s - 1406.91s |  like, if you're, like if Cartier does like those jaguar heads that are like the little tiny
1406.93s - 1412.31s |  stones, those are usually pointer emeralds. They're more or less worthless, but, you know,
1412.31s - 1418.25s |  it's like finding, you know, a, a perfect mashing hash, like in a file dump or something like
1418.25s - 1425.14s |  that. It's just something that could only be from that. So, all of them with the exception of
1427.38s - 1432.38s |  the King of Keys, who to this day, nobody knows who he is, they all got arrested. Um, they
1433.34s - 1438.34s |  on average served three years in prison and they never recovered any of the money or the
1441.22s - 1448.22s |  diamonds. Which brings me to fun crime fact number four, or tip, I guess. If you're gonna
1448.22s - 1453.22s |  perform a heist, do it in Europe. Uh, these, these guys, they ended up, uh, yeah, they're
1454.22s - 1463.89s |  they're somewhere like retired with a bunch of money and a bunch of diamonds, and it's just,
1471.13s - 1476.57s |  I love that for them. Um, but there are lessons that, that we can take from this as well,
1476.57s - 1482.77s |  especially on the security side. Number one, defense in depth, like that, that vault door
1482.79s - 1487.79s |  had ten different security features alone. But it only works if you do it properly. Because
1490.53s - 1495.53s |  the specter of security is not in fact security. Like you can think something is secure, but
1498.01s - 1503.01s |  unless you're actually, you know, walking the walk, it doesn't really matter. Um, complacency
1503.83s - 1508.83s |  is the enemy of complexity. So again, if something is tedious for you, don't make it easy
1513.57s - 1519.41s |  for you at the expense of making it easy for somebody to pull off the heist of a lifetime.
1519.41s - 1524.15s |  You're worth that 30 seconds. Like the number of people that just like won't bother putting
1524.15s - 1529.15s |  like MFA on their phones like blows my mind. And finally, stupid and or lazy can be dangerous
1529.37s - 1534.37s |  both ways. It can be dangerous on the blue team, it can be dangerous on the red team. So make
1537.47s - 1542.17s |  sure that you're, you know, taking care of yourself, that you're being thorough about things
1542.17s - 1547.95s |  and that you're actually thinking about things in a layered approach. Like defensive depth
1547.95s - 1552.95s |  like is all about compensating controls. If something happens, like these guys just jumped
1552.95s - 1557.63s |  out of a plane with 60 parachutes and not one of them went off. Like that's, that's a problem.
1557.63s - 1563.61s |  Don't, don't do that. That's gonna make you fall faster because of the weight. Um, but yeah,
1563.61s - 1585.22s |  that's, that's pretty much the main takeaways from there. Uh, do we have any questions? I, I
1585.22s - 1590.22s |  wish. I, I'm gonna be honest, I am 40 years old, I still get a brain freeze when I eat ice
1591.82s - 1596.82s |  cream. I can't, I can't do that. What's up? I mean, I like them. Yes, you can do that.
1602.96s - 1619.29s |  You can come to this microphone for questions so everybody can hear the question. Is it
1619.29s - 1624.29s |  possible that the German police are retired in the islands? I, I'm not gonna say it's
1626.79s - 1632.37s |  impossible. Um, you never know like where people are gonna have inside, uh, inside people.
1632.37s - 1636.87s |  I personally feel like somebody had to have gotten paid off at this just because of the sheer,
1636.87s - 1642.37s |  like it's almost like mathematically impossible negligence. Um, but yeah, um, so that's
1642.37s - 1648.61s |  definitely possible. What changes did they make as a result of this to make it not happen
1648.61s - 1656.72s |  again? Uh, so number one, they stopped giving out blueprints. Uh, um, and some of the other
1656.72s - 1662.02s |  things that happened is, um, they started really forcing through those updates. Like the
1662.02s - 1666.42s |  security cameras, like they weren't waiting, they weren't making excuses to stop spending
1666.42s - 1671.16s |  money or to, you know, not spend the money. They updated their systems there. They made
1671.16s - 1676.36s |  sure that they were staying ahead of trends and they also worked on like actual enforcement
1676.36s - 1684.59s |  so that, um, you know, these things that they set up to work could actually do their job. Yes.
1684.59s - 1690.49s |  Is there a movie about this? Uh, not about this one specifically actually. There should be.
1690.49s - 1700.58s |  That's the real crime. Uh. So stay away you. Uh, so what is the answer to the, that type of
1702.56s - 1707.56s |  complacency issue? Cause I think that's something we see a lot when it comes to, for example,
1711.56s - 1715.56s |  you know, self-driving cars, the difference between asking people to remain alert all the
1715.56s - 1721.14s |  time and asking people to just, oh, it's fine until it suddenly isn't is a big one, right? So
1721.14s - 1725.48s |  how do you get people to, to take that key and split it in half and put it away properly every
1725.48s - 1730.48s |  single time? I, I, I think the solution for that has to be some sort of accountability. Uh,
1732.62s - 1738.52s |  and it doesn't, it doesn't fix anything, you know, necessarily in the long term, but if all
1738.52s - 1742.42s |  of a sudden, you know, these leaders and things like that are, are, you know, their
1742.42s - 1746.70s |  managers are checking to make sure that like the jobs are completed, uh, making sure that, you
1746.70s - 1752.24s |  know, due diligence is performed and making sure that, you know, there is something, there's
1752.24s - 1756.58s |  some sort of teeth that are gonna, you know, prevent that from happening. Like, uh, if say
1756.60s - 1763.34s |  you push, uh, an untested update out to a billion computers, uh, you know, probably get fired at
1763.34s - 1768.34s |  the very least, or some fines or something, you know? I mean, that's a hypothetical. Uh,
1774.18s - 1782.38s |  that wouldn't happen. Uh, any other questions? Alright, well, uh, this is a dream come
1782.38s - 1783.62s |  true, so thanks everybody.
