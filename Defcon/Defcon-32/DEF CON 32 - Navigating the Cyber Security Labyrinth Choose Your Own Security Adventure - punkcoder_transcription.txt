  "description": "Over the last 36 months, the cybersecurity landscape has evolved with unprecedented complexity, marked by ransomware, supply chain attacks, zero-days, remote work challenges, and more. Amid mass layoffs and pervasive mental burnout, organizations face daunting tasks in defending against escalating cyber threats. Layoffs exacerbate the skills gap, leaving teams stretched thin. Mental burnout hampers practitioners' abilities. In this talk, we'll explore the impacts of recent and chart a path forward for application security.

 Alright, so you are now attending Navigating the Cyber Security Labyrinth, Choose Your Own Security Adventure.
7.50s - 14.50s |  Uh, the first thing I'd like to point out is because I am an independent consultant and I am here as my own business, as Wistan Security,
14.50s - 20.80s |  um, nothing that I say on this stage will ever be endorsed by any of my employers.
20.80s - 24.30s |  Okay? So we're just getting that out of the way here to start with.
24.30s - 29.30s |  Uh, my name is James and because of that I go by Punk Coder.
29.30s - 38.80s |  Um, I spent 15 years as a software developer. I did, have done the last 7 or 8, 9, 10, something like that as a security professional in AppSec.
38.80s - 43.80s |  Um, but this talk isn't about me. It's about you.
43.80s - 52.60s |  And I want to make that very clear because this entire conversation is, you know, me kind of reflecting back over the things that have happened to me
52.60s - 57.10s |  and what we've done to get here and what the future needs to look like.
57.10s - 62.40s |  So this is a conversation about exploits. Sorry I'm not going to be dropping any zero days on you.
62.40s - 67.40s |  Code, AppSec, and maybe some memes.
67.40s - 74.90s |  Okay? So this has been a tough couple years for all of us. For those of you who recognize this, this is the image of what happened in the world
74.90s - 82.40s |  whenever we had the breached forums who went offline because they were taken down by the United States government.
82.70s - 91.70s |  Then within 48 hours we're back online again, only to be taken down another 72 hours later, only to come back 24 hours later after that.
91.70s - 96.70s |  I feel like this has been tough no matter what side of any of this you're on.
96.70s - 100.70s |  If you're Red Team, you're AppSec, it doesn't matter. It's all been tough.
100.70s - 106.70s |  In top of that, we're dealing with things left over from the pandemic where all of our lives changed
107.00s - 113.00s |  and cyber security inevitably changed because of this.
113.00s - 119.00s |  Okay? It's been tough because this has also been the last year of breaches.
119.00s - 124.00s |  Like this isn't even a full list, this is just kind of the big ones.
124.00s - 127.00s |  Okay? And they barely fit on my screen.
127.00s - 134.33s |  But did we stand up and say, enough is enough?
134.33s - 138.33s |  Quick, everybody get the servers back online, get back to business.
138.63s - 144.63s |  It's all just pace after another, one after another, and we continue along with the speed.
144.63s - 146.63s |  And everybody likes a joke.
146.63s - 152.63s |  The number of times that I've seen this set up because humor is how we deal with it, right?
152.63s - 158.63s |  We saw this come out and this was originally because of a node library that was a problem
158.63s - 165.63s |  and then we had the log4j incident and it became the poster child for log4j
165.93s - 171.93s |  and then we had the CrowdStrike issue come out and it became the poster child for CrowdStrike, right?
171.93s - 175.93s |  That tire, you know, we always talk about the little block that's down there that's possibly
175.93s - 179.93s |  going to be the end of it, but in this case, it was the giant block.
179.93s - 185.93s |  They took 8.5 million computers off of the world, critical infrastructure,
185.93s - 191.93s |  and then a couple weeks later, had a giant banner just across the street at this previous
192.23s - 196.23s |  conference at Black Hat advertising and you know what?
196.23s - 204.08s |  Their booth was filled and sometimes we reveled in the fact that we were running stuff
204.08s - 208.08s |  so old we couldn't be impacted by it.
208.08s - 214.08s |  There were people who were absolutely proud of the fact that this didn't happen at Southwest Airlines
214.08s - 220.59s |  because they were running Windows 3.1, okay?
220.59s - 224.59s |  Now, we have things that we are trying to do in this space to make things better.
224.89s - 228.89s |  There are people who are fighting the good fight and trying to go for this stuff.
228.89s - 234.89s |  NIST has done a fantastic job of going through and saying, hey, we've got the secure by design guidelines.
234.89s - 240.89s |  How many people have heard or read the secure by design guidelines published by CISA?
240.89s - 244.89s |  How many of you have actually talked to your developers about them?
244.89s - 250.22s |  Did your response look like this?
250.52s - 256.52s |  I was told you will take C away from me when you pry it from my cold dead hands.
256.52s - 264.57s |  No matter how hard we push for rust, this is what we're up against.
264.57s - 270.57s |  And to show you the other side of this conversation, how desperate the other side of this is,
270.57s - 276.57s |  this is the group of signatories for the secure by design paper.
276.57s - 280.57s |  Saying this is what we need to do.
280.87s - 288.87s |  Last time I checked, we were up to 12 foreign countries, including every major security agency in the United States.
288.87s - 298.31s |  And the answer to this was, you will take C from me when you pry it from my cold dead hands.
298.31s - 301.31s |  So where does this leave us?
301.31s - 308.55s |  We keep trading long-term success for short-term wins.
308.55s - 317.23s |  I don't think I'm alone in this in saying that we can't continue down this path.
317.53s - 321.53s |  Like cyber security cannot continue down this path.
321.53s - 324.53s |  And that's part of the reason I'm up here giving this conversation.
324.53s - 329.84s |  Because we end up with things like this.
329.84s - 337.82s |  Anybody spot what's missing in this?
337.82s - 341.82s |  What's missing in this is the human being.
341.82s - 346.82s |  Because we have continued to go round cycle after cycle after cycle,
346.82s - 355.89s |  thinking that one more piece of software will fix the issue.
356.19s - 362.19s |  And we here in the AppSec have a particularly difficult challenge.
362.19s - 368.19s |  You can go to three different managers and ask them, what does AppSec mean?
368.19s - 371.19s |  And you know what answer you get?
371.19s - 373.19s |  You get this one.
373.19s - 377.19s |  AppSec is the process of finding and fixing and preventing security vulnerabilities
377.19s - 381.19s |  in application level in hardware, software and development processes.
381.49s - 385.49s |  It includes guidance on measures for applications designing and developing
385.49s - 389.49s |  through the whole life cycle including after the application has launched.
389.49s - 391.49s |  You know why you get that answer?
391.49s - 400.72s |  Because that's the first answer you get when you type what is AppSec into Google.
400.72s - 403.72s |  Our bosses don't understand what it is that we do.
403.72s - 406.72s |  I know in the 15 years I was a software developer,
406.72s - 410.72s |  my boss kind of understood what I did.
411.02s - 415.02s |  I moved over for several years doing cybersecurity.
415.02s - 419.02s |  I can guarantee you my boss didn't understand what it was that we did.
419.02s - 425.02s |  And the worst part about this is, the longer that we go along this,
425.02s - 429.85s |  the crazier the headlines get.
429.85s - 433.85s |  This is not a sustainable path.
433.85s - 437.85s |  But I will say, I don't want to go full gloom and doom on this,
437.85s - 441.85s |  because there have been good things that have come out of this.
442.15s - 446.15s |  If you do not follow Inspirational Skeletor,
446.15s - 448.15s |  I strongly suggest that you do.
448.15s - 453.15s |  As an InfoSec person, this has kept me in a sane, rational position
453.15s - 455.15s |  for far longer than it should have.
455.15s - 459.15s |  And when this doesn't work, I go to therapy.
461.15s - 465.15s |  And I can tell you, the people that I interact with,
465.15s - 469.15s |  and I say this specifically because I think it's important for us to address mental health
469.15s - 471.15s |  and normalize it.
471.45s - 475.45s |  Because the work that we do in AppSec and in cybersecurity,
475.45s - 481.45s |  a lot of times is thankless work with long hours and stressful issues.
481.45s - 489.08s |  There is no shame in saying, hey, I need somebody to talk to about this.
489.08s - 493.08s |  But this leads down a whole series of paths and questions, right?
493.08s - 496.08s |  We've gone the full spectrum from where all of this is,
496.08s - 500.08s |  what we think will actually fix it, and how we cope with this situation.
500.38s - 502.38s |  But that's not what this talk is about.
502.38s - 506.38s |  This talk is about trying to figure out the answers
506.38s - 510.38s |  to some of the questions that will determine your future,
510.38s - 514.38s |  my future, and our future together, collectively.
514.38s - 515.38s |  Okay?
515.38s - 517.38s |  Because realistically speaking,
517.38s - 520.38s |  the people who are making the difference are sitting in this room.
520.38s - 523.85s |  My boss doesn't understand what it was.
523.85s - 527.85s |  I pointed out a couple things that became an issue later on,
527.85s - 529.85s |  and my boss went, wow, that's a really good job.
530.15s - 533.15s |  You should do that long term.
533.15s - 535.15s |  Cool.
535.15s - 536.15s |  Okay?
536.15s - 539.15s |  So, this is going to lead you to a series of questions.
539.15s - 541.15s |  And I want, we're going to do a little voting.
541.15s - 542.15s |  This is going to be a little interactive.
542.15s - 543.15s |  Do something fun.
543.15s - 545.15s |  Hack a little slideshow, right?
545.15s - 547.15s |  So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to pop up a question.
547.15s - 550.15s |  We're going to talk about pros and cons, and I'm going to have you vote.
550.15s - 552.15s |  And we're going to go in a direction.
552.15s - 555.15s |  So, the easy one, because it's fun for us all to sit back
555.15s - 557.15s |  and kind of be angry at it right now.
557.45s - 558.45s |  AI.
558.45s - 561.45s |  How many people think that AI is actually going to go through
561.45s - 563.45s |  and save cybersecurity?
563.45s - 567.45s |  How many people think that AI in AppSec is going to solve the problem?
567.45s - 570.45s |  And I'm not putting myself in either direction,
570.45s - 573.45s |  because I've got an argument for both sides.
573.45s - 574.45s |  So, think about it.
574.45s - 577.45s |  And think about what the outcome of this is.
577.45s - 580.45s |  And the reason that I'm asking you to think about that outcome
580.45s - 582.45s |  is because more than likely at this point,
582.45s - 584.45s |  somebody's already checked in with you, right?
584.75s - 588.75s |  This decision was made before we ever sat down at the table.
588.75s - 591.75s |  How many people got asked what their opinion
591.75s - 594.75s |  about Copilot was before it rolled out?
594.75s - 604.31s |  How much did your response matter?
604.31s - 605.31s |  Okay?
605.31s - 608.31s |  So, on the pro side, how many people honestly believe
608.31s - 611.31s |  that AI will do all the things that the security vendors say it will,
611.31s - 614.31s |  and it will change us, and we will be better off for it
614.31s - 616.31s |  in the AppSec space?
616.31s - 620.31s |  How many people say that AI is the next thing
620.61s - 622.61s |  that this C-suite wants us to do,
622.61s - 624.61s |  more interested in focusing on that
624.61s - 628.61s |  than the fact that everything right now is on fire?
628.61s - 629.61s |  All right.
629.61s - 634.50s |  We will go down the path of AI dooms us all.
634.50s - 635.50s |  Okay?
635.50s - 638.50s |  So, just to kind of prove this and step this out,
638.50s - 640.50s |  I went to chat.ghpt,
640.50s - 642.50s |  and you don't need to actually read the text here,
642.50s - 646.50s |  because I will give you all the slides following this.
646.50s - 648.50s |  But the humor of this is I said,
648.80s - 650.80s |  Hey, go out and generate a form for me
650.80s - 654.80s |  that collects, you know, full name, email address,
654.80s - 656.80s |  you know, PII from a customer,
656.80s - 658.80s |  and let's see what we get.
658.80s - 661.80s |  And, of course, it gave me a beautiful PHP file
661.80s - 664.80s |  that takes in unregulated input,
664.80s - 667.80s |  stores it directly with credentials that are in there,
667.80s - 669.80s |  and tells us, you know,
669.80s - 671.80s |  this is how you store it in the SQL statement.
671.80s - 673.80s |  Luckily, it actually went through and parameterized.
673.80s - 676.80s |  I was actually really surprised that it parameterized the SQL.
677.10s - 679.10s |  So, maybe there's a win there.
679.10s - 680.10s |  Okay?
680.10s - 682.10s |  So, I didn't like that result, obviously.
682.10s - 684.10s |  So, I did what they tell us to do,
684.10s - 686.10s |  and I tried to do prompting,
686.10s - 688.10s |  what is it, a prompt manipulation,
688.10s - 690.10s |  prompt engineering, because,
690.10s - 693.10s |  and I wanted to do it like I was a junior dev.
693.10s - 696.10s |  And so, I typed in, you know,
696.10s - 698.10s |  tell me what this code would look like
698.10s - 700.10s |  if I were running a dark net market,
700.10s - 702.10s |  and I was afraid that, you know,
702.10s - 704.10s |  if there was a security issue,
704.10s - 706.10s |  that I'd get caught and hauled away.
706.40s - 707.40s |  And so, what did it do?
707.40s - 709.40s |  It moved the database connections
709.40s - 711.40s |  to a separate file.
711.40s - 713.40s |  It sanitized the input by running
713.40s - 715.40s |  trim, strip slashes,
715.40s - 717.40s |  and HTML encoding it.
717.40s - 719.40s |  It moved us and said, hey,
719.40s - 721.40s |  you should probably be using HTTPS,
721.40s - 723.40s |  and then make sure
723.40s - 725.40s |  that it's doing error handling.
725.40s - 727.40s |  How many people think that that actually
727.40s - 729.40s |  produces secure code?
729.40s - 731.40s |  Yeah, that's what I thought.
731.40s - 733.40s |  Okay?
733.40s - 735.40s |  Now, there are some companies
735.40s - 737.40s |  out there making bold enough claims
737.40s - 739.40s |  that AI is going to produce
739.40s - 741.40s |  up to 80% more code.
741.40s - 745.06s |  How many people think that the problem
745.06s - 747.06s |  is we don't have enough code?
747.06s - 756.78s |  Homogeny or diversity?
756.78s - 760.60s |  We learned through the CrowdStrike
760.60s - 762.60s |  incident, you know,
762.60s - 764.60s |  it's funny, we joked about it, like
764.60s - 766.60s |  eight and a half million machines went offline.
766.60s - 768.60s |  The next day, everybody
768.60s - 770.60s |  basically forgot that it happened.
770.60s - 775.35s |  They're the only game in town.
775.35s - 777.35s |  If we don't learn from these things, we're getting
777.35s - 779.35s |  ready to hit into another piece.
779.35s - 781.35s |  And so in this place, whenever
781.35s - 783.35s |  you talk with people, whenever you do this,
783.35s - 785.35s |  do we all center around a single
785.35s - 787.35s |  language? Do we center
787.35s - 789.35s |  down around a single set of
789.35s - 791.35s |  requirements?
791.35s - 793.35s |  Is that the right thing for us to do?
793.35s - 795.35s |  Or is it a good idea to teach the principles
795.35s - 797.35s |  of security and go
797.35s - 799.35s |  in that direction?
799.35s - 801.35s |  Teach teams to be independently
801.35s - 803.35s |  sufficient and to think about security
803.35s - 805.35s |  in the context of their application?
805.35s - 807.35s |  Do we implement a check
807.35s - 809.35s |  in the CICD pipeline that is the same
809.35s - 811.35s |  for every single one of our programs?
811.35s - 813.35s |  Or do we have
813.35s - 815.35s |  teams go through, implement the ones that
815.35s - 817.35s |  make sense for them, and tune
817.35s - 819.35s |  them and teach them how to tune
819.35s - 821.35s |  so that it meets
821.35s - 823.35s |  their threat model?
823.35s - 825.35s |  I'm asking that question
825.35s - 827.35s |  because you all are going to be the ones
827.35s - 829.35s |  that are implementing that.
829.35s - 831.35s |  As AppSec, that's what we do.
831.35s - 833.35s |  And whenever it
833.35s - 835.35s |  comes time, there's a good chance
835.35s - 837.35s |  that maybe somebody comes to you and
837.35s - 839.35s |  says, this is what we're doing.
839.35s - 841.35s |  There's also a good chance if you've
841.35s - 843.35s |  done your job well enough that somebody's going to ask
843.35s - 845.35s |  you for your opinion on it
845.35s - 847.35s |  and then ask you
847.35s - 849.35s |  to implement it.
849.35s - 851.35s |  I want you to think about these questions.
851.35s - 853.35s |  I want you to have the answer to these
853.35s - 855.35s |  questions before we
855.35s - 857.35s |  get to the point where somebody asks that question
857.35s - 859.35s |  because in the moment,
859.35s - 861.35s |  you're not going to be thinking
861.35s - 863.35s |  clearly about the subject.
863.35s - 865.35s |  And this is kind of a high-level one.
865.35s - 867.35s |  We're going to go into some more
867.35s - 869.35s |  interesting ones here a little further on.
869.35s - 871.35s |  But I want you to
871.35s - 873.35s |  think about that. And as you're sitting in the audience
873.35s - 875.35s |  today, sitting through our
875.35s - 877.35s |  talks about SQL injection,
877.35s - 879.35s |  AI manipulation,
879.35s - 881.35s |  think about these questions
881.35s - 883.35s |  because as you're
883.35s - 885.35s |  going through and putting those in context,
885.35s - 887.35s |  these are the questions that you're going to have to answer
887.35s - 889.35s |  for people when you take this information
889.35s - 893.72s |  back.
893.72s - 895.72s |  To become
895.72s - 899.06s |  a community leader,
899.06s - 901.06s |  do you sit back and do your own thing
901.06s - 903.06s |  or do you help build a
903.06s - 905.06s |  community? I'm not
905.06s - 907.06s |  on this stage because I am an elite
907.06s - 909.06s |  hacker.
909.06s - 911.06s |  Most people can tell you
911.06s - 913.06s |  that the reason that I teach courses
913.06s - 915.06s |  on AppSec is because
915.06s - 917.06s |  I halfway know what I'm talking about.
917.06s - 919.06s |  I'm passionate about the fact
919.06s - 921.06s |  that it gets done, which is the reason I do it.
921.06s - 923.06s |  If you came here
923.06s - 925.06s |  looking for the latest zero day, you're
925.06s - 927.06s |  not going to get it from me. That's not how this works.
929.06s - 931.06s |  But that doesn't mean I can't
931.06s - 933.06s |  start people on the path who
933.06s - 935.06s |  will be the people who find those zero days.
935.06s - 937.06s |  It doesn't mean you
937.06s - 939.06s |  can't be the person who starts that down.
939.06s - 942.70s |  So you have a choice.
942.70s - 944.70s |  Do we sit back,
944.70s - 946.70s |  do our own thing,
946.70s - 948.70s |  or do we work within the community
948.70s - 952.33s |  to start things?
952.33s - 954.33s |  Tough question.
954.33s - 956.33s |  Which way do we go?
956.33s - 961.02s |  This is your journey.
961.02s - 964.58s |  Become a community leader. Votes.
964.58s - 966.58s |  Do your own thing.
968.58s - 970.58s |  So the path on this one leads us down
970.58s - 972.58s |  being a community leader.
972.58s - 974.58s |  And I will tell you about my experience with this.
974.58s - 976.58s |  This is the group
976.58s - 978.58s |  of people who runs B-Sides Boulder.
978.58s - 980.58s |  The reason that
980.58s - 982.58s |  B-Sides Boulder runs is because originally
982.58s - 984.58s |  there was B-Sides Denver
984.58s - 986.58s |  and all the tickets sold out
986.58s - 988.58s |  before
988.58s - 990.58s |  we could get seats.
990.58s - 992.58s |  And I'm not blowing smoke here
992.58s - 994.58s |  because two of the people who are responsible
994.58s - 996.58s |  for this are sitting in the audience.
996.58s - 998.58s |  This happened
998.58s - 1000.58s |  because we saw something
1000.58s - 1002.58s |  and we said, hey, I don't know
1002.58s - 1004.58s |  the first thing about running a conference,
1004.58s - 1006.58s |  but we want to do it.
1006.58s - 1008.58s |  We're now five years in,
1008.58s - 1010.58s |  going strong.
1010.58s - 1012.58s |  Most of this is just
1012.58s - 1014.58s |  giving up. Being a part of the community
1014.58s - 1016.58s |  doesn't mean giving up your entire life.
1016.58s - 1018.58s |  It doesn't mean you only
1018.58s - 1020.58s |  do that now. It doesn't mean
1020.58s - 1022.58s |  all of us are busy.
1022.58s - 1024.58s |  Everybody here is busy.
1024.58s - 1026.58s |  We all have things going on.
1026.58s - 1028.58s |  I do B-Sides Boulder.
1028.58s - 1030.58s |  I do AppSec Village at DEF CON.
1030.58s - 1032.58s |  My hope is that
1032.58s - 1034.58s |  one of you walks out of this room
1034.58s - 1036.58s |  thinking about this and take it back
1036.58s - 1038.58s |  to your home.
1038.58s - 1040.58s |  Start the next DC 720.
1040.58s - 1042.58s |  Start the next B-Sides event.
1042.58s - 1044.58s |  Go do a developer conference
1044.58s - 1046.58s |  where you just go and say, hey,
1046.58s - 1048.58s |  we're going to have a cybersecurity meetup
1048.58s - 1050.58s |  with developers at a conference.
1050.58s - 1052.58s |  You want to have coffee? Let's go have coffee.
1052.58s - 1054.58s |  Any of that small stuff
1054.58s - 1056.58s |  makes an impression. It makes a difference.
1056.58s - 1059.93s |  Okay?
1059.93s - 1061.93s |  So this is an interesting one.
1061.93s - 1063.93s |  Do you become a business leader?
1063.93s - 1065.93s |  Your boss walks in,
1065.93s - 1067.93s |  pulls you up on Zoom, says,
1067.93s - 1069.93s |  okay, here's the deal.
1069.93s - 1071.93s |  That thing that you said, hey, SQL injection
1071.93s - 1073.93s |  is a pretty bad thing, yeah, we had
1073.93s - 1075.93s |  an incident that happened,
1075.93s - 1077.93s |  and that bad thing happened,
1077.93s - 1079.93s |  and we noticed, hey, you said that bad thing
1079.93s - 1081.93s |  was going to happen, so we think you should be
1081.93s - 1083.93s |  in charge of it now. Okay?
1083.93s - 1085.93s |  So your choice is, you can either be in charge
1085.93s - 1087.93s |  of it now, or
1087.93s - 1089.93s |  you can have somebody who may not
1089.93s - 1091.93s |  know what they're doing be in charge
1091.93s - 1093.93s |  of you. It's your choice.
1093.93s - 1095.93s |  One means your life is now going to be
1095.93s - 1097.93s |  spreadsheets and nothing technical.
1097.93s - 1099.93s |  And the other side
1099.93s - 1101.93s |  means you have the ability to make an
1101.93s - 1103.93s |  impact on a much smaller level.
1103.93s - 1107.24s |  What do you do?
1107.24s - 1109.24s |  This one I don't know has a right answer.
1109.24s - 1111.24s |  That's
1111.24s - 1113.24s |  the reason there's no choice down here,
1113.24s - 1115.24s |  is because inherently
1115.24s - 1117.24s |  this is open-ended. This is
1117.24s - 1119.24s |  each one of our path. I went down this
1119.24s - 1121.24s |  path and I made the wrong choice.
1121.24s - 1123.24s |  I realize that now, for myself.
1123.24s - 1125.24s |  But I'm asking
1125.24s - 1127.24s |  you to sit down and think and consider
1127.24s - 1129.24s |  that question before it happens
1129.24s - 1131.24s |  to you so you can think clearly
1131.24s - 1133.24s |  about the process and not just think about
1133.24s - 1136.74s |  what's going on in the moment.
1136.74s - 1138.74s |  To exploit or not to exploit?
1138.74s - 1140.74s |  Okay?
1140.74s - 1142.74s |  We talk about this in going
1142.74s - 1144.74s |  through the process, right? Do you go
1144.74s - 1146.74s |  through and say, hey, that
1146.74s - 1148.74s |  looks a little shady.
1148.74s - 1150.74s |  Maybe I should actually test it
1150.74s - 1152.74s |  for something. What's at the end of that
1152.74s - 1154.74s |  path? Right?
1154.74s - 1156.74s |  And I ask that question because I can
1156.74s - 1158.74s |  make an argument for both directions on this.
1158.74s - 1160.74s |  Again, this is a very interesting one.
1160.74s - 1162.74s |  You get a device, somebody drops it in your
1162.74s - 1164.74s |  hand and says, hey, I think there's something wrong with
1164.74s - 1166.74s |  this. Do you go after
1166.74s - 1171.75s |  it? Does it matter?
1171.75s - 1173.75s |  Does the time that you spend in your
1173.75s - 1175.75s |  free time or in your work time
1175.75s - 1177.75s |  justify the contribution
1177.75s - 1182.15s |  that you'll make in that space?
1182.15s - 1184.15s |  The reason I ask is because
1184.15s - 1187.98s |  of this graph. This is
1187.98s - 1189.98s |  the CVEs per year.
1189.98s - 1191.98s |  And it's not a super
1191.98s - 1193.98s |  sophisticated graph. We can
1193.98s - 1195.98s |  see that the big number is going up.
1195.98s - 1197.98s |  And I can tell you
1197.98s - 1199.98s |  that as somebody who's an app sec, we
1199.98s - 1201.98s |  feel the pain when this goes
1201.98s - 1203.98s |  up. Everybody in the room, you feel
1203.98s - 1205.98s |  the pain whenever this goes up, right? I'm not just
1205.98s - 1207.98s |  crazy.
1207.98s - 1209.98s |  But guess what? If we trace
1209.98s - 1211.98s |  this out in the direction that we're going,
1211.98s - 1213.98s |  this is what that looks like.
1213.98s - 1218.18s |  That is what it looks like.
1218.18s - 1221.66s |  That line that's going up
1221.66s - 1223.66s |  there, that's a
1223.66s - 1227.67s |  close curve on it. Stuff's
1227.67s - 1229.67s |  not sustainable now.
1229.67s - 1231.67s |  You don't believe me that
1231.67s - 1233.67s |  here's the backlog article for
1233.67s - 1235.67s |  what happened
1235.67s - 1237.67s |  that was going on with this.
1237.67s - 1239.67s |  And I don't want to drop this on software developers
1239.67s - 1241.67s |  because I don't think it's fully their problem.
1241.67s - 1243.67s |  Part of it's our
1243.67s - 1245.67s |  problem, part of it's management. I usually
1245.67s - 1247.67s |  come through here and ask, how many PMs are
1247.67s - 1249.67s |  in the crowd? How many PMs are in the crowd today?
1249.67s - 1251.67s |  Do we have any in here
1251.67s - 1253.67s |  right now? There's
1253.67s - 1255.67s |  one, there's like three people pointing
1255.67s - 1257.67s |  to one person over here.
1257.67s - 1259.67s |  I'm not calling
1259.67s - 1261.67s |  you out. What I'm saying is by you being
1261.67s - 1263.67s |  in this room, it's important because
1263.67s - 1265.67s |  it helps you to prioritize
1265.67s - 1267.67s |  this stuff. The developers
1267.67s - 1269.67s |  are not the bad guys. The app sec people
1269.67s - 1271.67s |  are not the bad guys. This stuff happens.
1271.67s - 1273.67s |  Okay?
1273.67s - 1275.67s |  It happens
1275.67s - 1277.67s |  to everyone. This is
1277.67s - 1286.14s |  hard. I've been
1286.14s - 1288.14s |  very vocal about this one.
1288.14s - 1290.14s |  The 90 day window for exploits.
1290.14s - 1292.14s |  Do you give them the 90
1292.14s - 1294.14s |  days? Do you work with a team
1294.14s - 1296.14s |  that is difficult to work with
1296.14s - 1298.14s |  who turns around and threatens you
1298.14s - 1300.14s |  with legal action?
1300.14s - 1302.14s |  Or do you just drop it hot
1302.14s - 1304.14s |  and say, congratulations, here's your
1304.14s - 1308.34s |  O day? Once you've found that
1308.34s - 1310.34s |  exploit, what
1310.34s - 1312.34s |  path are you going to take?
1312.34s - 1314.34s |  And I'm asking you to
1314.34s - 1316.34s |  think about those consequences because I
1316.34s - 1318.34s |  guarantee you the person who dropped
1318.34s - 1320.34s |  the log for J on
1320.34s - 1322.34s |  Minecraft did
1322.34s - 1324.34s |  not think about all
1324.34s - 1326.34s |  of the people who would be working
1326.34s - 1332.57s |  Christmas day. So what do
1332.57s - 1334.57s |  you do with that? How do you
1334.57s - 1336.57s |  answer that question before we get to that
1336.57s - 1338.57s |  space?
1338.57s - 1340.57s |  How do you reach out to developers?
1340.57s - 1342.57s |  Because at the end
1342.57s - 1344.57s |  of this, every piece of software
1344.57s - 1347.82s |  isn't going to solve our problem.
1347.82s - 1349.82s |  The problems that we have is that writing software
1349.82s - 1351.82s |  is hard. Writing
1351.82s - 1353.82s |  secure software is
1353.82s - 1359.56s |  even harder.
1359.56s - 1361.56s |  So I've been a
1361.56s - 1363.56s |  proponent for a long time of saying, hey,
1363.56s - 1365.56s |  if you're a purple team member,
1365.56s - 1367.56s |  you need to be bringing a developer to
1367.56s - 1369.56s |  Defcon. If you have to sell them on the parties,
1369.56s - 1371.56s |  sell them on the parties.
1371.56s - 1373.56s |  But get them here. Let's
1373.56s - 1375.56s |  have that conversation. Take the
1375.56s - 1377.56s |  things that you learned here in this room, take
1377.56s - 1379.56s |  it back to the lunchroom and just
1379.56s - 1381.56s |  chat with them. Do
1381.56s - 1383.56s |  lunch and learns, do presentations.
1383.56s - 1385.56s |  Make it spicy. Add memes.
1385.56s - 1387.56s |  Whatever you have to do
1387.56s - 1389.56s |  to build that relationship because that's
1389.56s - 1391.56s |  the important part of this.
1391.56s - 1393.56s |  Why? Because guess
1393.56s - 1395.56s |  what? We've got
1395.56s - 1397.56s |  another issue in AppSec that's
1397.56s - 1401.03s |  coming in this direction. These
1401.03s - 1403.03s |  are the numbers from Stack Overflow.
1403.03s - 1405.03s |  As it turns out right now, we've
1405.03s - 1407.03s |  got a big problem with developers not being
1407.03s - 1409.03s |  very happy.
1409.03s - 1411.03s |  And anybody who's been in this room
1411.03s - 1413.03s |  who's actually written code understands
1413.03s - 1415.03s |  why. When
1415.03s - 1417.03s |  it works, you're under fire
1417.03s - 1419.03s |  to produce more features. When
1419.03s - 1421.03s |  it doesn't work, you're under fire
1421.03s - 1423.03s |  to get things working.
1423.03s - 1426.73s |  Every time that the ops and IT
1426.73s - 1428.73s |  people get angry at the development
1428.73s - 1430.73s |  staff because something that they did
1430.73s - 1432.73s |  broke production, they don't think
1432.73s - 1434.73s |  about the fact that the app developer
1434.73s - 1436.73s |  has been sitting there for 80
1436.73s - 1438.73s |  hours working overtime
1438.73s - 1440.73s |  to get that feature into
1440.73s - 1442.73s |  production to meet something that
1442.73s - 1444.73s |  the sales team sold
1444.73s - 1446.73s |  but never asked them about
1446.73s - 1448.73s |  and then broke
1448.73s - 1450.73s |  production which means they're going to be on for at least
1450.73s - 1452.73s |  another 10 hours trying to fix
1452.73s - 1454.73s |  production. That's what
1454.73s - 1456.73s |  leads to burnout in this
1456.73s - 1458.73s |  channel. And guess what?
1458.73s - 1460.73s |  There's no shade here but this
1460.73s - 1462.73s |  can't be everybody's exit. This is the guy
1462.73s - 1464.73s |  that wrote NeoFetch. It says
1464.73s - 1466.73s |  very clearly up in his description
1466.73s - 1468.73s |  have taken up farming, archived
1468.73s - 1470.73s |  all of his projects.
1470.73s - 1476.60s |  This is the path that we're going
1476.60s - 1478.60s |  and the problem with it is
1478.60s - 1480.60s |  that whenever the developers go
1480.60s - 1482.60s |  you can't protect something
1482.60s - 1484.60s |  that you don't understand
1484.60s - 1486.60s |  and those developers are
1486.60s - 1488.60s |  the repository for the knowledge of
1488.60s - 1490.60s |  how those decisions were made,
1490.60s - 1492.60s |  what security concerns were brought
1492.60s - 1494.60s |  in during the actual development
1494.60s - 1496.60s |  process.
1496.60s - 1498.60s |  You know how I know that
1498.60s - 1500.60s |  you can't do this?
1500.60s - 1502.60s |  I have the receipts. If you've been in this
1502.60s - 1504.60s |  room long enough you saw me on stage giving this
1504.60s - 1506.60s |  presentation where I said the exact same thing.
1506.60s - 1508.60s |  Guess what? Two years later
1508.60s - 1510.60s |  we're in the exact same
1510.60s - 1512.60s |  spot. The only difference
1512.60s - 1514.60s |  is because of what's going
1514.60s - 1516.60s |  on with the economic recession
1516.60s - 1518.60s |  we're seeing developers leave our
1518.60s - 1520.60s |  companies faster
1520.60s - 1522.60s |  and at a higher pace and
1522.60s - 1524.60s |  when they leave they take knowledge of
1524.60s - 1526.60s |  how those systems work with them.
1526.60s - 1530.17s |  So as application security
1530.17s - 1532.17s |  people who know how hard this is
1532.17s - 1534.17s |  we have to lead with empathy.
1534.17s - 1536.17s |  We have to go in this place.
1536.17s - 1538.17s |  If you are expecting
1538.17s - 1540.17s |  the adults to show up
1540.17s - 1542.17s |  they're never going to get here.
1542.17s - 1544.17s |  I hate to tell you this
1544.17s - 1546.17s |  but we are the adults in the room.
1546.17s - 1548.17s |  By virtue of you
1548.17s - 1550.17s |  taking time out of your free time
1550.17s - 1552.17s |  to sit in this room and listen
1552.17s - 1554.17s |  to topics about things that you
1554.17s - 1556.17s |  will take back to a work setting
1556.17s - 1558.17s |  you are the adult
1558.17s - 1562.15s |  in the room. The reason I'm
1562.15s - 1564.15s |  asking you to actively think about
1564.15s - 1566.15s |  the answers to these questions and think
1566.15s - 1568.15s |  about this process and think
1568.15s - 1570.15s |  about this while we're going through and listening
1570.15s - 1572.15s |  to the talks that are going on today.
1572.15s - 1574.15s |  Listening to the talks that you will hear in other
1574.15s - 1576.15s |  villages is because of this.
1576.15s - 1578.15s |  Okay?
1578.15s - 1580.15s |  And with that I have about
1580.15s - 1582.15s |  three minutes and I want to say
1582.15s - 1584.15s |  thank you. Because
1584.15s - 1586.15s |  you all are coming to this place
1586.15s - 1588.15s |  to take up
1588.15s - 1590.15s |  and take charge
1590.15s - 1592.15s |  and hopefully make a difference in this space.
1592.15s - 1594.15s |  If there is anything that I can ever
1594.15s - 1596.15s |  personally do to help you
1596.15s - 1598.15s |  do not hesitate to reach out to me.
1598.15s - 1600.15s |  And I hope you would take that
1600.15s - 1602.15s |  and pay that forward to the developers that
1602.15s - 1604.15s |  you work with, to the IT people
1604.15s - 1606.15s |  who are working overtime, to the
1606.15s - 1608.15s |  architects who are trying to figure out how to secure
1608.15s - 1610.15s |  things before we actually know how the technology
1610.15s - 1612.15s |  works. We are all
1612.15s - 1614.15s |  in this together.
1614.15s - 1616.15s |  Okay?
1616.15s - 1618.15s |  So let's treat each other with a little respect
1618.15s - 1620.15s |  and the next time that somebody wants to
1620.15s - 1622.15s |  sit there and rag on the development team for
1622.15s - 1624.15s |  breaking production, just look at them and say
1624.15s - 1626.15s |  hey, we don't do that here.
1626.15s - 1628.15s |  Okay? With that
1628.15s - 1630.15s |  thank you very much for coming to listen to my talk.
