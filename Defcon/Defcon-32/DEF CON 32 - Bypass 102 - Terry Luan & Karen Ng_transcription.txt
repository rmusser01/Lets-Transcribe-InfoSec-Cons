0.00s - 0.76s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 All right.
0.76s - 3.32s |  So since we're experiencing technical difficulties,
3.32s - 5.92s |  I'm just going to start talking at you guys
5.92s - 7.24s |  about what we're talking about.
7.24s - 9.76s |  Could you open up my slides?
9.76s - 12.76s |  And yeah, and you guys are just going to have to deal with that.
12.76s - 14.80s |  Yeah, imagine I will be very descriptive.
14.80s - 18.56s |  But the first part of this is intro, and it's just talking.
18.56s - 20.52s |  So let's start with that.
20.52s - 22.20s |  So hello, everybody.
22.20s - 23.76s |  Welcome to Bypass 102.
23.76s - 26.20s |  In this talk, we're going to be covering basic bypass
26.20s - 27.24s |  remediation.
27.24s - 29.64s |  So a general prerequisite for this talk
29.68s - 31.96s |  is I'm hoping that you've seen Bypass 101.
31.96s - 34.28s |  If you haven't, I recommend you watch that later
34.28s - 36.72s |  when it is uploaded.
36.72s - 39.56s |  We were on the creator stage earlier for that talk.
39.56s - 41.88s |  Yeah, and then please keep all questions till the end
41.88s - 43.52s |  if we have time for questions.
43.52s - 47.56s |  So for those that aren't aware, what bypass is
47.56s - 50.44s |  is basically ignoring the lock and trying
50.44s - 52.76s |  to figure out a way to exploit the door
52.76s - 55.32s |  hardware or the surrounding area in order
55.32s - 59.16s |  to gain access into a locked out space.
59.16s - 62.34s |  Here, just let me do that.
62.34s - 65.62s |  So again, this covers basic remediation and retrofits
65.62s - 68.14s |  that'll help you secure your facility from these basic
68.14s - 70.10s |  bypass methods.
70.10s - 73.30s |  So similar to cybersecurity, physical security
73.30s - 76.02s |  vulnerabilities and remediation is basically
76.02s - 78.34s |  an ongoing forever game of cat and mouse.
78.34s - 80.18s |  Every time somebody finds a vulnerability,
80.18s - 81.86s |  someone else comes up with a patch.
81.86s - 84.44s |  And then for that patch, someone finds a new vulnerability,
84.44s - 86.06s |  and it repeats over and over again.
86.06s - 87.90s |  And that's the cycle of security.
87.90s - 91.18s |  Same thing applies for cyber.
91.18s - 93.30s |  So like I mentioned earlier, lock bypass
93.30s - 95.02s |  involves ignoring that lock completely
95.02s - 97.98s |  and finding an alternative way to get that door open
97.98s - 101.18s |  or avoid using the door altogether.
101.18s - 102.98s |  These bypass methods are very often
102.98s - 105.32s |  used in physical security and physical hacking,
105.32s - 106.98s |  and they are generally simple enough
106.98s - 111.72s |  to use by anyone with a little bit of know-how.
111.72s - 113.46s |  In case you guys don't have that know-how,
113.46s - 114.94s |  you can come over to our village and check us out,
114.94s - 116.44s |  and we will teach you that know-how,
116.48s - 118.56s |  and show you how easy it is.
118.56s - 120.92s |  Now I'm going to talk a little bit about latch-targeted
120.92s - 122.84s |  bypasses.
122.84s - 127.24s |  So this applies to all the, oh, looks
127.24s - 129.32s |  like we have the presentation coming up.
129.32s - 135.00s |  But you'll see in the slide what I mean.
135.00s - 138.84s |  So essentially, this is ways to remediate
138.84s - 144.36s |  the bypass, which is called targeting.
144.36s - 147.88s |  So targeting targets a latch that holds the door closed.
147.88s - 150.76s |  And essentially, by carting it, you're
150.76s - 154.68s |  essentially bypassing this dead latch, which prevents
154.68s - 157.24s |  the plunger from moving.
157.24s - 159.60s |  So the best way of bypassing this,
159.60s - 162.64s |  is to install, of remedying this,
162.64s - 173.05s |  is to install the doors properly.
173.05s - 175.33s |  So installing these dead latches,
175.33s - 178.89s |  and especially doors properly, is extremely difficult,
178.89s - 181.81s |  especially if your door is, for example, wooden
181.81s - 187.21s |  or just because they're in order for,
187.21s - 190.33s |  if you guys have watched the Bypass 101 talk,
190.33s - 193.05s |  you guys know that in order for the dead latch to work,
193.05s - 195.25s |  it has to be actuated when the door is closed.
195.25s - 198.45s |  Now the issue is that there are tolerances, right?
198.45s - 202.77s |  So for example, it needs to be installed exactly
202.77s - 208.85s |  the correct way so that, give me one second,
208.85s - 211.21s |  so that when the door is closed,
211.21s - 214.09s |  that the dead latch is actuated.
214.09s - 217.05s |  What that means is that also, if you push the door,
217.05s - 219.97s |  for example, it will still be actuated.
219.97s - 224.01s |  The door cannot warp, et cetera, et cetera.
224.01s - 255.12s |  So there are a couple of different ways.
255.12s - 258.92s |  OK, so we're trying our best to get the AV working.
258.92s - 262.00s |  But again, the DEF CON Wi-Fi is our best friend
262.00s - 263.76s |  in the whole wide world.
263.76s - 265.88s |  So Terry was about to talk about dead latches.
266.64s - 268.72s |  So I'll talk about that until we can figure out
268.72s - 269.76s |  how to get this to load.
269.76s - 272.96s |  Can you come back?
272.96s - 275.20s |  Yeah, so basically, go back.
275.20s - 283.85s |  Please go back.
283.85s - 285.17s |  Thanks, guys, for being patient.
285.17s - 288.29s |  So a dead latch is essentially a security mechanism
288.29s - 291.77s |  that is built into that door closing
291.77s - 294.89s |  hardware that allows you to stop people
294.89s - 296.49s |  from using this exploit.
296.49s - 298.77s |  So for those familiar with Bypass 101,
298.77s - 301.03s |  what we call latch slipping or latch shoving,
301.03s - 302.33s |  it seems a little bit too easy.
302.33s - 304.01s |  And it's because it is.
304.01s - 306.17s |  It has this security mechanism that prevents you
306.17s - 308.29s |  from being able to do this.
308.29s - 311.89s |  But a lot of the installers of doors and other things
311.89s - 314.13s |  in a facility doesn't really think about that.
314.13s - 315.97s |  They don't care about the security.
315.97s - 318.17s |  They don't know what these features do.
318.17s - 321.21s |  All in all, it means that people aren't
321.21s - 323.93s |  keeping that security mindset in place
323.93s - 325.81s |  while they're doing their installations.
325.81s - 328.29s |  And that leads to a lot of vulnerabilities.
328.29s - 331.59s |  So I'm sure you guys have seen the retrofits for this before.
331.59s - 333.57s |  If you've ever walked along a long hallway
333.61s - 338.57s |  and you've seen doors with a big metal plate over that latch,
338.57s - 340.61s |  usually what this is is a retrofit.
340.61s - 344.45s |  So they found that that dead latch isn't working properly.
344.45s - 345.93s |  And so instead of fixing the door,
345.93s - 348.01s |  instead of installing it properly,
348.01s - 350.25s |  they're just putting this panel over it and going,
350.25s - 351.25s |  OK, that's good enough.
351.25s - 352.93s |  Now they can't latch slip the door.
352.93s - 355.05s |  However, these can still be bypassed.
355.05s - 359.21s |  For example, with this little latch cover, what people can do
359.21s - 360.77s |  is take a little bit of piano wire,
360.77s - 362.45s |  stick it behind the latch, and open it
362.45s - 365.61s |  pretty much the exact same way without much more trouble.
365.61s - 366.73s |  Do we have it?
366.73s - 369.66s |  Yay!
369.66s - 376.24s |  So if you could full screen that.
376.24s - 382.96s |  How many hackers does it take to play a PowerPoint presentation?
382.96s - 384.76s |  Oh, OK, there we go.
384.76s - 388.22s |  Do we have the slideshow?
388.22s - 396.02s |  You're fine.
396.02s - 397.90s |  We're going to give this a second to load.
397.90s - 399.22s |  And hopefully this video loads.
399.22s - 405.42s |  That'll give us a little demo of how the dead latch works.
405.42s - 406.58s |  There it is.
406.58s - 409.02s |  OK, so like I was mentioning, so there's the latch.
409.02s - 410.58s |  And that little half moon shape there
410.58s - 411.98s |  is what's called the dead latch.
411.98s - 413.46s |  And when it's pushed into the door,
413.46s - 415.74s |  it actually prevents the latch from being
415.74s - 421.08s |  able to be pushed in, thus stopping that exploit.
421.08s - 424.04s |  So obviously, the easiest way to prevent people
424.04s - 427.32s |  from using this exploit is just to install your door properly
427.32s - 429.80s |  and make sure that the dead latch is actually being pushed
429.80s - 432.24s |  in when that door is closed.
432.24s - 433.88s |  I already talked about this retrofit,
433.88s - 435.72s |  so we're just going to skip over that.
435.72s - 437.60s |  And again, it can be bypassed.
437.60s - 439.72s |  In fact, usually on red team engagements,
439.72s - 441.52s |  I'm looking out for these kinds of covers,
441.52s - 447.46s |  because it means that that latch is vulnerable to an attack.
447.46s - 450.06s |  Next, I'm going to be talking about handle-targeted bypass.
450.06s - 453.06s |  So this usually mimics a person on the other side of the door
453.06s - 454.86s |  exiting from the other side and can
454.86s - 457.96s |  be used on lever handles and doorknobs and crash bars.
457.96s - 460.54s |  The easiest way to prevent this, I'm going to have to go fast.
460.54s - 461.46s |  I'm running out of time.
461.46s - 462.62s |  So the easiest way to prevent this
462.62s - 465.46s |  is to have a properly sized door that fits into the door frame
465.46s - 467.62s |  and doesn't leave gap enough for tools
467.62s - 470.18s |  to fit in, around, or under.
470.18s - 472.30s |  In addition to that, certain types of lever handles
472.30s - 476.70s |  will make it more difficult to use the under-the-door tool.
476.70s - 479.18s |  A retrofit like this can help reduce the amount of gap
479.18s - 480.94s |  underneath your door and make sure people
480.94s - 482.56s |  can't fit tools underneath.
482.56s - 484.18s |  You've probably seen things like this,
484.18s - 488.02s |  which isn't intended to better secure your facility
488.02s - 490.66s |  for weatherproofing, but it can make using those kinds of tools
490.66s - 492.54s |  more difficult. In addition to that,
492.54s - 495.34s |  windows next to your door or alongside your door
495.34s - 496.98s |  can make it easier to use these tools.
496.98s - 500.54s |  So cover them up or don't have them at all if not necessary.
500.54s - 502.58s |  Mag locks can also provide additional security,
502.58s - 507.05s |  but again, these can also be bypassed.
507.05s - 508.01s |  So you have deadbolts.
508.01s - 511.45s |  This is a deadbolt. They're different from dead latches
511.45s - 514.97s |  and have a thumb turn on the other side.
514.97s - 518.01s |  The best way of remediating this is
518.01s - 520.37s |  to have a double-sided deadbolt. Basically,
520.37s - 522.41s |  you don't have that thumb turn on the other side.
522.41s - 525.81s |  This prevents you from using JTools to bypass it.
525.81s - 528.37s |  If you don't know what JTool is, you can look in our village.
528.37s - 531.09s |  Yeah, and basically, the thing is, in exchange for security,
531.09s - 532.61s |  you are losing a bit of convenience,
532.61s - 534.05s |  but sometimes in certain facilities,
534.05s - 536.97s |  it is worth that exchange.
536.97s - 539.01s |  For push bars, the main thing is don't have holes
539.01s - 540.65s |  or gaps in your door if possible.
540.65s - 542.65s |  Use a push bar with dead latches
542.65s - 546.21s |  to prevent latch-targeted attacks.
546.21s - 548.73s |  There are also retrofits, which you'll see in a bit.
548.73s - 554.08s |  We also have a video.
554.08s - 556.32s |  We had a video. It's no longer there.
556.32s - 557.64s |  We were on a red team engagement.
557.64s - 561.48s |  Basically, someone was able to reach their hand around
561.48s - 563.44s |  and push on the push bar from the other side.
563.44s - 565.68s |  If you want to see it, you can come by after.
565.68s - 567.76s |  I'll show you the video on my phone.
567.76s - 569.52s |  Oh, yeah, you can see the retrofit here.
569.52s - 573.88s |  They can be bypassed, but it makes it a lot harder.
573.88s - 576.60s |  You can also use bar guards, again,
576.60s - 578.24s |  to further prevent bypasses.
578.24s - 580.24s |  Again, it is possible, but, yeah.
580.24s - 581.96s |  Okay, cool. Next is removing the hinges.
581.96s - 584.64s |  So, usually, you can take out those little hinge pins
584.64s - 586.60s |  and pull the door off of the frame.
586.60s - 588.08s |  There are special security hinges,
588.08s - 590.28s |  such as these ones called set-screw hinges
590.28s - 594.08s |  and stud-pit hinges that allow you to lock that door,
594.08s - 595.64s |  and even if the hinge pin is taken out,
595.64s - 598.56s |  you can't actually remove the door from the frame.
598.56s - 599.88s |  Button-push combination locks.
599.88s - 601.08s |  So, these are simplex locks.
601.08s - 602.88s |  They use the default combination from the factory,
602.88s - 605.00s |  two and four at the same time, and then the number three.
605.00s - 607.00s |  Change your default combinations.
607.00s - 608.24s |  Other combination locks, as well,
608.24s - 609.88s |  you can easily find these defaults online.
609.88s - 612.80s |  Change your combination!
612.80s - 614.72s |  Enter phones. Okay, so, I'm sure you've seen these before.
614.72s - 615.48s |  These are enter phones.
615.48s - 617.80s |  They're used to let people into apartments in high-rises.
617.80s - 619.48s |  You can call up using that enter phone,
619.48s - 621.12s |  and the resident can push a button on their phone
621.12s - 622.92s |  and allow you access.
622.92s - 625.36s |  There's a master code that comes from the factory
625.36s - 627.24s |  that allows the owner of the building
627.24s - 628.28s |  and the owner of the enter phone
628.28s - 630.28s |  to add entry codes and add residents.
630.28s - 631.84s |  You can find these online from manufacturers.
631.84s - 634.24s |  So, change your combination!
634.24s - 636.00s |  Further to that, these enter phones are key-to-like,
636.00s - 638.56s |  and with these keys, you're actually able to open
638.56s - 640.20s |  all enter phones by that same brand
640.20s - 642.24s |  and get at the electronics.
642.24s - 643.32s |  Guess how you can fix this?
643.32s - 644.44s |  You can change your lock.
644.44s - 646.96s |  Wow, they don't have to be the default.
646.96s - 647.80s |  There's also these.
647.80s - 649.92s |  These are security bars and enter phone covers,
649.92s - 651.24s |  and they can be used to prevent people
651.24s - 652.88s |  from being able to force it open,
652.88s - 655.00s |  or even if they have a key for the enter phone,
655.00s - 658.40s |  from opening it and getting at those circuitries inside.
658.40s - 660.44s |  You have requests to exit sensors.
660.44s - 662.12s |  They're set up so that you can unlock
662.12s - 665.40s |  when you're coming in from the inside of the building.
665.40s - 668.24s |  So, most of them rely on passive infrared.
668.24s - 670.12s |  If someone can trick the sensor
670.12s - 672.32s |  into thinking there's someone inside and exit the building,
672.32s - 673.44s |  they'll allow them access.
673.44s - 677.00s |  What you have is you have sensors
677.20s - 679.12s |  that use both PR and radar
679.12s - 680.88s |  to detect if someone is coming in.
680.88s - 683.20s |  There used to be a company called Interlogix,
683.20s - 685.16s |  which made a REC sensor.
685.16s - 686.12s |  They no longer exist.
686.12s - 688.48s |  There are other companies in the market,
688.48s - 692.00s |  but they're many thousands of dollars, but they do exist.
693.36s - 697.12s |  For remediation, REC sensors are generally more convenient.
697.12s - 698.28s |  They are less secure.
698.28s - 701.60s |  For more secure areas, there are these REC buttons
701.60s - 702.76s |  that you can use.
702.76s - 704.24s |  Make sure to put them away from the door
704.24s - 706.64s |  so people can't use any sort of wire
706.64s - 709.28s |  to push it from the outside.
709.28s - 711.40s |  As well as that, tap in, tap out, of course,
711.40s - 714.20s |  is the most secure way to let people in and out of spaces.
714.20s - 715.60s |  But again, you're trading that convenience
715.60s - 717.36s |  in for that security.
717.36s - 719.04s |  Elevators, so you see elevators.
719.04s - 719.88s |  Two minutes, okay.
719.88s - 721.56s |  We have elevators everywhere in modern buildings.
721.56s - 723.88s |  There's a lot of bypasses that you can get around them.
723.88s - 726.28s |  A lot of elevator locks can be changed out
726.28s - 728.00s |  and don't have to be the default.
728.00s - 729.72s |  This is not true for fire recall switches.
729.72s - 732.16s |  Do not touch your fire recall key switches.
732.16s - 733.76s |  But generally, the best way to prevent people
733.76s - 735.56s |  from hacking your elevator to get into a space
735.56s - 737.92s |  is don't rely on elevator floor lockouts for security.
737.92s - 740.04s |  It's way better to have a little hallway
740.04s - 742.44s |  and then have additional locked doors past that elevator
742.44s - 744.40s |  in order to prevent people from gaining access
744.40s - 745.64s |  when they're not supposed to.
745.64s - 748.00s |  Other remediation, so it's really important
748.00s - 751.12s |  to foster a proper security culture within your company.
751.12s - 752.68s |  Things like tailgating and other methods
752.68s - 754.56s |  of social engineering are often the easiest way
754.56s - 756.32s |  to get into a secure space.
756.32s - 757.74s |  Employees that disallow tailgating
757.74s - 759.40s |  or see people that they don't recognize and say,
759.40s - 760.24s |  hey, who are you?
760.24s - 761.06s |  Do you work here?
761.06s - 761.90s |  Can you prove it?
761.90s - 763.12s |  Can help stop bad actors.
763.12s - 765.52s |  In addition to that, alarms and sensors are very important.
765.52s - 767.28s |  So they can be used in combination with retrofits
767.28s - 768.96s |  to prevent bypasses and catch people
768.96s - 770.56s |  that are in the middle of using bypasses.
770.56s - 772.28s |  These are imperfect and can be bypassed,
772.28s - 773.88s |  but the main thing is without sensors,
773.88s - 775.12s |  without cameras, without detection,
775.12s - 778.08s |  anyone can get in with sufficient force and time.
778.08s - 779.00s |  Like I mentioned, cameras,
779.00s - 780.80s |  they are part of a complete security plan.
780.80s - 782.40s |  They can deter, enable response,
782.40s - 784.94s |  and minimize risk of insurance claims refusal.
784.94s - 786.44s |  Last of all, timing analysis.
786.44s - 789.12s |  So this is a service that I do work in.
789.12s - 791.24s |  And in combination with your alarms, sensors, cameras,
791.24s - 792.68s |  everything, and your response time
792.68s - 794.36s |  has to all be taken into consideration
794.36s - 796.80s |  in order to get to the bad actor
796.80s - 799.72s |  before they're able to do any harm to your company.
799.72s - 801.20s |  Okay, we've reached the end for the questions.
801.20s - 802.08s |  I'm so sorry, guys.
802.08s - 805.72s |  You're gonna have to play this video at like 0.5 speed.
805.72s - 807.10s |  If you guys have any questions,
807.10s - 809.12s |  you can come by The Village and come talk to me and Terry.
809.12s - 810.76s |  I'm very sorry for the technical difficulties,
810.76s - 812.08s |  but I hope you guys enjoyed it regardless.
812.08s - 812.92s |  Thank you!
