 All right, sorry for the delays
3.07s - 7.11s |  So this is safe cracking for everyone. My name is Jared
13.60s - 15.92s |  Okay, so a little bit about me. I
17.04s - 20.20s |  Am a lock sport enthusiast. I have been picking locks
20.72s - 26.84s |  For close to 20 years now and I got into safe manipulation shortly after
27.28s - 29.60s |  So I've been doing that for about 15 years. I
30.56s - 32.56s |  game a bunch
32.56s - 37.96s |  And I'm a professional rock climber. That's like my main source of income at the moment
38.36s - 43.60s |  so this talk this talk will cover how
44.46s - 46.36s |  specifically group to
46.36s - 51.06s |  Mechanical safe locks work. So there's different classifications, which I will go over and
51.58s - 57.42s |  Group two is sort of just the standard sort of security classification for safe locks
58.78s - 62.54s |  Whatever safe you buy essentially if it has a mechanical lock on it
63.06s - 66.66s |  Vast majority of the time it will be a group to safe lock
66.66s - 72.44s |  I will cover the flaws in this design and how we can exploit them as well as
72.74s - 74.90s |  variations on the techniques that we use
76.66s - 80.38s |  And then I will also cover differences between group to safe locks
80.82s - 86.46s |  They all operate on the same principles, but there are some slight differences that set them apart from each other
87.02s - 95.90s |  So the security classification starts with group two as the lowest security classification and there is
96.42s - 100.02s |  Absolutely, nothing preventing anyone from figuring out the combination
100.86s - 108.62s |  And then group 2m. There are some small improvements to where they make it a lot harder to manipulate and
109.18s - 116.22s |  then group one is the high security classification where they add in a lot of extra features and
117.22s - 122.06s |  Supposedly they're supposed to withstand manipulation for about 20 hours minimum
123.14s - 125.14s |  however, that is completely
125.70s - 127.70s |  false and I
127.94s - 133.10s |  Don't actually understand why they have different groups because they all kind of suck at the moment
133.34s - 138.58s |  and then group 1r is the same as group one, but the R stands for
140.14s - 146.06s |  Radiologically resistant so a common attack could be using x-rays
146.34s - 148.34s |  to view the inside of the lock and
148.54s - 155.66s |  So they make the parts inside out of plastic usually delrin a low-density plastic and it makes it really hard to x-ray it
156.18s - 160.36s |  So I will cover the parts of a lock here
163.27s - 165.27s |  normally, I would go up to the screen and
166.35s - 168.91s |  Point, but however, I don't think that's possible
170.03s - 172.19s |  So you should see a large
172.83s - 178.27s |  Brass circle in the center and it's got a bit of a cutout on it
178.27s - 188.59s |  That is called the drive cam and the microphone is gonna be okay there. It should be okay
189.23s - 213.26s |  All right, cool. So here this is the drive cam. This is connected directly with a dial
213.58s - 217.46s |  So as you turn the dial this drive cam will turn as well
218.54s - 222.74s |  We have this arm. This arm is we just call it the the lever
223.62s - 230.06s |  But this protrusion is called the nose and that nose as you can see rests on top of the drive cam
230.94s - 232.94s |  Behind the drive cam we have wheels
233.34s - 249.40s |  All right. So when you dial the combination on one of these locks what happens is these wheels?
249.56s - 255.80s |  They have a cutout called a gate in them. Okay, there's one gate per wheel and dialing the correct combination
256.72s - 259.16s |  Lines up each of these gates with each other
259.76s - 264.80s |  Now behind the lever you can see a bar that bar is a fence. That's what we call it
264.80s - 272.36s |  And when you dial the correct combination all of the gates will be lined up under the fence and that is so that the fence
272.36s - 274.36s |  Can fall into the gates
274.56s - 281.86s |  so here we can see the correct combination has been dialed and
283.94s - 291.58s |  When you turn the drive cam so that this cutout is underneath the nose that allows everything to fall down and what that does is
291.86s - 297.40s |  Turning the dial further here pulls on the nose and allows the bolt to be retracted
297.72s - 311.44s |  If I can get this camera to show at least somewhat I can show a little example here
311.96s - 319.28s |  so we are looking at the top of the lock and you can see and
320.52s - 324.36s |  You can see there's a bar and that is the fence
325.60s - 327.60s |  Behind it underneath it are the wheels
328.68s - 330.68s |  When you dial the combination
331.36s - 333.08s |  Here we go
333.08s - 335.84s |  Okay, it will line up each of the gates
336.92s - 338.04s |  underneath
338.04s - 344.10s |  that fence
344.10s - 346.66s |  Sorry, it's a little hard to keep this in view
352.13s - 354.13s |  okay, so I
354.29s - 357.13s |  Am lining up the gates underneath the fence
372.63s - 387.48s |  Sorry for the technical difficulties here. Not sure how visible that is
388.44s - 393.32s |  All right. Well, we'll just go back to the slides
394.20s - 407.16s |  So essentially the way that it works is each of the wheels
407.80s - 409.44s |  to in turn
409.44s - 415.12s |  Grab the wheels behind it. So that drive cam which is directly connected to the dial
416.48s - 421.76s |  Has a protrusion much like this wheel does here and that protrusion
422.12s - 426.44s |  Will ride in a groove on top of the wheel behind it
427.24s - 434.92s |  Until it hits the the protrusion on that wheel and so essentially it can freely ride around and
435.40s - 440.12s |  Once it makes contact it will grab that wheel and it will turn with the dial
440.88s - 444.56s |  That wheel on the bottom also has a protrusion
444.56s - 450.24s |  This is called a drive pin that drive pin will ride in a groove on the wheel behind it
450.84s - 452.84s |  until it hits
452.88s - 457.80s |  That wheel and picks it up so it takes one rotation
458.60s - 461.80s |  To ensure that you have picked up the next wheel
461.96s - 468.32s |  That's because if you are moving the wheel in one direction and you reverse rotation
468.32s - 472.68s |  You have to go all the way around until they can pick it up again
475.41s - 477.41s |  Here's an example. I
478.49s - 480.49s |  Put this here in case the camera didn't work
480.89s - 485.85s |  I would like to show this more visually, but this is the best I have at the moment
485.97s - 492.33s |  So we can imagine this black piece at the back being the drive cam and each of these wheels being one of the wheels in
492.33s - 500.81s |  The lock so what happens is this this drive cam will spin around and here it's making contact with the drive pin of this
500.85s - 507.29s |  third wheel the wheel closest to the drive cam is called the third wheel then the second and then the first and
507.57s - 511.17s |  So if we wanted to spin this wheel in the other direction
512.17s - 518.49s |  this drive cam would turn all the way around one full rotation until it can hit this drive pin and
519.37s - 524.33s |  Same thing for this third wheel if we want the third wheel to pick up the second wheel
524.33s - 529.37s |  It has to go all the way around until it hits the drive pin and so on and so forth
529.37s - 533.21s |  And so this is how all the wheels are able to move together
533.81s - 536.17s |  But also be able to be set separately
536.81s - 541.76s |  So vulnerabilities
542.36s - 545.20s |  So here we have a close-up of the drive cam
545.76s - 550.12s |  Now the nose normally rests on top of the drive drive cam
550.12s - 555.64s |  It will rest and ride along the whole outer edge of the drive cam as the drive cam spins
556.88s - 563.56s |  but when we get to this drop-in area the nose will drop in ever so slightly and
564.56s - 570.32s |  The vulnerability here is this is not symmetrical this drop-in point is
571.36s - 575.68s |  asymmetrical and on one side we have a great curve to it and
576.56s - 580.92s |  So you can see the further down we go in this drop-in point
581.12s - 586.88s |  There is less wiggle room from one side to the other is significantly less than up high
586.88s - 589.52s |  There's much more wiggle room up there
589.68s - 596.00s |  And the thing about this is because that nose will go a little bit into the drop-in point
596.60s - 603.08s |  When we turn the drive cam we can feel it hit the wall of that drop-in area
604.28s - 607.96s |  We can actually feel that on the dial as a bit of resistance
608.24s - 612.00s |  So we spin the dial so that this drop-in point is centered
612.16s - 615.28s |  Below the nose that nose is not touching the drive cam at all
615.44s - 621.64s |  And if we turn a little further then the nose will hit the edge as in this picture right here
621.64s - 627.00s |  And we can feel when that happens. So if that nose is up high in
627.56s - 629.56s |  this contact or this
629.60s - 630.72s |  drop-in area
630.72s - 637.92s |  Then there will be a significant distance between the two points of contact on the walls of that drop-in area
637.92s - 639.92s |  And if the nose is lower
640.60s - 642.44s |  There will be less
642.44s - 644.44s |  Distance between feeling those points of contact
645.08s - 653.51s |  Now the thing that determines how high or low that nose is in that area is the fence
653.75s - 657.55s |  The fence here you can see is resting above the wheels
657.71s - 663.15s |  So we have the nose that is on the drive cam right now, and that is what's keeping that fence up
663.47s - 668.07s |  But when we turn the dial so the nose is over that drop-in area
668.83s - 672.03s |  Then the fence will fall down and rest on the wheel pack
672.23s - 676.31s |  That is essentially testing for if the combination is correct or not
676.31s - 681.15s |  If the gates were all aligned then the fence would not rest on top of the wheel pack
681.15s - 684.83s |  It would simply fall in and that would allow the lock to open
685.67s - 692.75s |  So here you can see the wheels are all different sizes. That's because we are not able to manufacture
693.59s - 698.19s |  Multiple wheels to be exactly the same size or to be perfectly circular
698.67s - 704.15s |  So here we will always have one wheel that's larger than the others as you can see here
704.15s - 711.63s |  It is the first wheel all the way to the left furthest from the drive cam. There's space here on the second and third wheel
712.31s - 718.23s |  So if we were to turn the dial so that the nose is over that drop-in point this fence
718.67s - 725.39s |  Will hit and rest only on this first wheel because it sticks up above the rest
726.39s - 731.75s |  Now this is where the previous slide comes in handy with the narrower
732.11s - 736.67s |  Space the further down you go because if we were to feel
737.23s - 742.35s |  Those contact points that point at which the nose hits the wall of the drop-in area
742.75s - 747.75s |  Those are called contact points and we measure how far apart those are
748.55s - 753.59s |  We would get a certain number a certain reading. Let's say on the dial that is six increments
754.43s - 761.51s |  But if we were to turn this first wheel and only this first wheel so that the gate is underneath the fence
761.87s - 765.07s |  This fence will not be resting up as high anymore
765.07s - 772.03s |  It will drop onto the next largest wheel causing the nose to be further down in that contact area
772.99s - 780.19s |  Which means that our points of contact are now going to be closer together instead of having a range of six
780.55s - 784.83s |  Sorry, six numbers on the dial apart. Maybe we can feel those points of resistance
785.71s - 793.23s |  Five and a half numbers apart and that tells us that we have the largest wheel in the correct position
793.35s - 796.83s |  so if we had let's say dialed a test combination and
797.23s - 802.35s |  This is what we have and we measure the contact point to be six numbers apart and
802.75s - 805.95s |  Then we dial the same exact test combination again
806.39s - 812.35s |  but with a different number for the first number in the combination which corresponds to the first wheel and that
812.67s - 817.67s |  Places the gate underneath the fence and we see that decrease in the contact area
818.19s - 823.35s |  Then we know whatever we just changed for that first number is the correct number
824.19s - 830.59s |  So you can see here it is resting on top of the first wheel and first wheel only this fence is not
830.75s - 832.59s |  Touching the second or third wheel
832.59s - 836.87s |  So if that first wheel does rotate so that the gate is underneath it
836.87s - 841.89s |  the fence will drop lower and we can feel that difference in the dial with how the
842.35s - 845.59s |  Nose touches the sides of that contact area
846.11s - 853.92s |  so essentially we have our plan of attack what we can do is we can find what's called a common low point and
854.12s - 856.12s |  and
856.16s - 862.44s |  That's because the wheels are not necessarily larger or smaller than the other wheels they can be
863.24s - 868.52s |  Bumpy or irregularly shaped. So if we have the wheels in the correct position
869.16s - 871.76s |  Maybe there is a bump on another wheel
872.36s - 875.16s |  Preventing that fence from falling down completely
875.36s - 882.20s |  So we want to find a point where across every wheel is a common low point where there are no extra
882.48s - 889.36s |  Bumps or ridges on any of the wheels and we have that nose as far down in that contact area as we can
890.04s - 895.12s |  And we do something called wheel isolation. We will isolate the third wheel
895.36s - 901.16s |  So essentially if we are only moving one wheel at a time and we get a reading
901.36s - 906.88s |  That the nose is lower in that contact area so we can feel that point of resistance
907.68s - 911.92s |  Where we feel the nose hitting the sides of that of that drive cam
912.48s - 913.44s |  and
913.44s - 917.56s |  We feel that decrease and only one wheel is moving
917.72s - 922.48s |  We know exactly what number and what wheel is in the combination
922.48s - 927.80s |  so if we're only moving the third wheel and we move it from 10 to 12 and
928.16s - 934.00s |  We have a drop in that in that reading. That means 12 is a third number in the combination. It makes things
934.60s - 936.60s |  really simple and
936.88s - 939.28s |  Then we have to look for gate signatures
939.28s - 946.68s |  Which is that drop that I have been talking about feeling the drop in the range of the of the two contact points
947.72s - 950.92s |  Once we find that we can find the center of the gate
950.92s - 957.16s |  We want to be precise because there there is a range at which the lock will open
957.16s - 962.40s |  That is not the correct combination. If you set your combination to be 10 20 and 30
962.92s - 965.44s |  Then you can open it with 9
966.44s - 969.04s |  21 29 that is a valid combination
969.56s - 974.40s |  Most locks will open plus or minus one and a quarter numbers on either side
975.36s - 979.84s |  So we want to find the center as close to the true combination as we can
979.84s - 984.84s |  In case we made a mistake along the way and we can repeat these steps for the second wheel
985.04s - 989.24s |  So essentially we can move only the second wheel in the lock by itself
989.24s - 994.32s |  And so if we find a gate signature if we find a decrease in that contact area
994.92s - 1001.12s |  Then we know what our second number in the combination is and there is no need to do this for the first wheel
1001.12s - 1006.22s |  And that's because if you have two numbers in a combination that has three numbers
1006.84s - 1008.84s |  You just brute force the last one
1008.84s - 1016.16s |  You just dial every two increments and then you don't have to worry about trying to manipulate the lock and get a reading
1017.32s - 1020.72s |  now there's a reason we go from three to one and
1021.04s - 1026.00s |  That's because the wheel that is closest to the drive cam is wheel three and
1026.60s - 1031.04s |  That lever is spring-loaded. It has a spring pressing down on it
1031.60s - 1037.84s |  That spring is only on one half. So it causes it to tilt. So when you are
1038.80s - 1042.60s |  So when you are turning the dial, so the nose is
1043.20s - 1045.20s |  over that that drop-in point
1045.88s - 1053.04s |  The fence will hit the wheels and it will actually tilt and cause it to only make contact with wheel three
1053.04s - 1060.36s |  I want to say 90% of the time and I say 90% because it's not always the same due to tolerances
1060.56s - 1067.00s |  But that is also why we find the common low point. That is why we find an area across all the wheels
1067.72s - 1071.92s |  That don't interfere with each other that there are no bumps is that it will help us ensure
1072.40s - 1076.12s |  That wheel three will be the first wheel that the fence touches
1076.68s - 1082.58s |  so the way we find this common low point is we can spin every wheel together and
1083.54s - 1086.38s |  We can take contact point readings
1086.38s - 1092.34s |  Which means you go to the place at which you can feel that resistance which you can feel that nose
1092.82s - 1096.36s |  Hitting the side of that drive drive cam and that in that
1097.28s - 1105.12s |  Contact area when you feel that resistance whatever number that is on the dial that is your contact point reading
1107.30s - 1108.54s |  after that
1108.54s - 1109.54s |  so
1109.54s - 1113.98s |  So we pick up all the wheels and we take contact point readings every ten increments
1113.98s - 1118.90s |  What that means is we will move every wheel together and on the dial
1118.90s - 1124.98s |  We will stop at zero then we will turn to that contact area and get our contact point
1125.10s - 1131.90s |  We will then turn all the wheels to ten and then twenty and then thirty so every ten increments
1132.02s - 1139.66s |  We take a contact point reading and we find the lowest reading we find the reading at which the wheels
1140.82s - 1145.62s |  Read the lowest so that is when that nose will be furthest down in that drive cam
1146.74s - 1153.98s |  We can leave the first and second wheels there so we can turn the dial until only the first two wheels are moving
1155.34s - 1158.58s |  and leave them there actually the third one moves too, but
1159.34s - 1162.86s |  We can if this gets the first and second wheels out of the way
1162.86s - 1170.02s |  And we can then proceed to move the third wheel as we see fit that third wheel is closest to the drive cam
1170.02s - 1174.62s |  So it is the first to move so if we have our first and second wheels
1175.38s - 1179.46s |  Somewhere we can move the third wheel without interrupting them
1179.86s - 1183.38s |  So with the third wheel
1183.38s - 1189.82s |  we can then spin and pick up the third wheel after we drop the first two off where they need to be and
1190.34s - 1196.14s |  We can move it every two increments so we can take that third wheel and let's say we can start on zero
1196.42s - 1196.90s |  Okay
1196.90s - 1202.54s |  and then we take a contact point reading so we just turn to that drop-in point and feel for the bit of
1202.62s - 1208.10s |  Resistance and see what numbers on the dial and then we can go back to where we left the third wheel from zero
1208.10s - 1210.10s |  We can then turn to two
1210.18s - 1215.50s |  Go take a contact point reading and then go turn our wheel to four take a contact point reading
1215.50s - 1218.26s |  so we do this 50 times around the dial and
1219.02s - 1224.70s |  Because we're only moving one wheel whenever we see a drop in our contact point reading
1225.42s - 1232.34s |  We know that number we just turned the third wheel to is our third number in the combination. There is no ambiguity about it
1233.58s - 1239.94s |  From there we can actually go back and just move the wheel through that area again
1239.94s - 1246.16s |  So if we find a drop in that contact point when the third wheel is at 30 or let's say 32
1246.54s - 1249.46s |  We can go back and because we went every two increments
1249.46s - 1255.70s |  we can hit all the odd numbers and we can find the exact center of where it needs to be if
1256.62s - 1258.58s |  We do not have a gate indication
1258.58s - 1262.38s |  that's actually fine with this method because we can use the lowest point and
1262.54s - 1270.14s |  Pretend that is our actual number and simply repeating these steps with the lowest points will actually give us the real
1270.22s - 1272.22s |  the real number in the combinations
1272.58s - 1276.40s |  The second wheel is a little more
1276.84s - 1283.10s |  Difficult. I am kind of skimming through this because my camera is not working. Unfortunately. I can't show this visually
1284.44s - 1290.72s |  But the second wheel it's just you you turn different number of times, but we're doing the same process
1291.08s - 1296.62s |  We are finding a way to move only the second wheel by itself inside the lock
1296.80s - 1299.88s |  So when we get an indication from the dial
1300.80s - 1310.40s |  We know it is the second number in the combination and for the first wheel if we had two good
1311.24s - 1312.24s |  indications
1312.24s - 1314.44s |  Then we can brute force the first wheel
1315.08s - 1319.84s |  Dialing zero then the second number and third number and then to second number third number
1319.84s - 1323.40s |  We're just dialing full combinations and what that does is
1323.88s - 1331.40s |  Allow us to cut down on the amount of time we need we spend dialing since going by every two numbers will open the lock
1333.04s - 1340.88s |  We can also keep track of the lowest point still just in case we were wrong earlier if we just keep pretending
1341.00s - 1346.44s |  That the lowest contact point readings we get is the real number in the combination
1346.44s - 1349.20s |  We can keep on repeating this process and
1350.12s - 1360.18s |  Eventually those low points will become the real numbers. So there are different types of group two locks
1361.62s - 1363.62s |  One second. Oh
1369.62s - 1371.82s |  Sorry, just trying to make sure I don't go over time here
1373.26s - 1375.38s |  So there are different types of group two locks
1375.74s - 1377.74s |  Um
1377.82s - 1380.34s |  Legar 3330 is a very common one
1380.34s - 1386.74s |  It is not one I suggest starting out with the wheels are more oval. And what that means is
1387.42s - 1392.34s |  We want our gates to be of each wheel under the fence in the lock
1392.34s - 1396.94s |  That is what tells us what is the right number or not with over wheels?
1397.70s - 1399.70s |  One wheel may shadow
1400.02s - 1404.50s |  Another wheel meaning when we have a gate underneath the fence
1405.06s - 1411.26s |  Another wheel could have a large bump on it because it's oval and might be
1411.66s - 1414.02s |  Keeping the fence from falling into that gate
1415.66s - 1418.42s |  We also have die bolt it's a very common
1419.26s - 1427.26s |  lock for ATMs banks their drive cam is u-shaped it is more symmetrical than what you have seen and
1427.98s - 1434.22s |  So in that case we can actually take both contact points very carefully and
1434.86s - 1436.86s |  That will give us
1436.86s - 1438.86s |  the same results
1439.34s - 1443.94s |  Here it's a little off-screen, but this is the most common model that you will see
1444.78s - 1446.66s |  sergeant in Greenleaf
1446.66s - 1449.62s |  6730 or 6741 they are virtually identical
1450.38s - 1456.54s |  One can just be opened with one and a half numbers on either side. So a little easier to open
1457.26s - 1461.38s |  But then essentially they're the same and this is what I suggest everyone to start with
1462.58s - 1467.94s |  After this talk, I will have a table with a bunch of these set up in the lock picking village
1468.78s - 1470.78s |  And you can try hands-on
1471.42s - 1475.68s |  so
1475.68s - 1482.84s |  These are really important tips. Okay. These are not just tips if you don't succeed. These are things you have to go in
1483.36s - 1489.30s |  Knowing and the most important is being precise in everything not just dialing
1489.46s - 1496.42s |  But reading the dial from the same angle every time if you look at it from the side that will change what you see on
1496.42s - 1498.42s |  the dial
1498.54s - 1502.74s |  You want to read the contact point with the same amount of force so we can feel
1503.22s - 1506.30s |  When that nose hits a drive cam and that's our contact point
1506.78s - 1514.02s |  However, we have to feel that with the same amount of force every time or we will get a different number on the dial
1515.14s - 1517.94s |  we can also try with a known combination and
1518.74s - 1520.74s |  What that means is
1521.06s - 1524.42s |  Knowing the combination. So if I know the combination is 10 20 30
1524.42s - 1528.98s |  I can only test from 0 to 40 for instance
1528.98s - 1533.14s |  And I know I should have an indication in that area
1533.14s - 1539.42s |  So I do not have to waste my time with numbers that I know are not in the combination. And so that helps
1540.14s - 1544.18s |  Helps with getting a feel for what you are looking for
1545.18s - 1550.54s |  You can also remove the back cover and look at inside the lock while you do it
1550.54s - 1553.50s |  And I have removed all the back covers on the locks
1553.62s - 1558.94s |  That will be for demonstration in the lock picking village so you can look inside and see what's happening. I
1559.78s - 1562.26s |  Apologize, I had some technical difficulties
1562.46s - 1567.30s |  So I understand that things are a little little complex with how I'm describing it
1567.30s - 1571.36s |  But we do have in-person demonstrations at the lock picking village
1572.32s - 1574.56s |  And if all else fails I do have a book
1575.96s - 1580.56s |  So the book is safe cracking for everyone on Amazon, but you don't need to buy it
1580.80s - 1584.12s |  That is only if you want the hardcopy version
1584.40s - 1590.98s |  There is a free PDF if you search the title of the book on YouTube safe cracking for everyone
1591.48s - 1593.96s |  There is it's like nine parts
1593.96s - 1600.68s |  But the first video in that series part one will have a link to the PDF of the book for free
1601.64s - 1605.64s |  other great resources are also the lock picking subreddit and
1606.88s - 1612.12s |  LPU lock pickers United discord. There should be a link to that discord in the subreddit
1612.44s - 1616.40s |  There's also a game called Sophie safe cracking simulator
1616.40s - 1618.28s |  I I don't know who Sophie is
1618.28s - 1623.44s |  But this is the best safe cracking game as that's all it is
1623.44s - 1627.52s |  it is just a lock and you can turn the dial and
1628.00s - 1635.04s |  There's different tools in this game where you can have x-ray vision, you know, you can practice with all these different
1636.04s - 1639.36s |  Variables that you can set up that you can't do in real life
1640.04s - 1643.72s |  and of course the best resource is practice, um, I
1644.76s - 1646.76s |  teach at a locksmithing
1647.44s - 1653.88s |  University and I have my safe manipulation course is about 18 hours long
1654.88s - 1659.24s |  That is not enough time for someone to be proficient with
1659.64s - 1663.68s |  guidance someone can open their first lock in that time, but I
1664.08s - 1668.76s |  Mean, I recommend at least 50 hours before you are even
1669.32s - 1675.76s |  Proficient in in this field. The hardest part is learning once you know and understand how a lock works
1676.44s - 1681.96s |  Then it's easy. It's just understanding that and getting the information that takes time
1684.29s - 1686.77s |  Here is a direct link to the book
1687.33s - 1689.33s |  I just hosted on Google Drive
1689.81s - 1693.73s |  Hopefully this QR code shows up well enough, but this should take you directly
1694.45s - 1697.57s |  To the PDF and you can download it and read it. I
1698.45s - 1703.47s |  Do include information on high security safe manipulation
1703.65s - 1708.97s |  This book as far as I know is the only place of that information
1708.97s - 1714.09s |  You cannot find that anywhere else and by high security safe manipulation
1714.09s - 1717.45s |  I mean there are locks in the group one category
1718.01s - 1722.41s |  that have been around this these designs have been around for a while and
1723.05s - 1726.21s |  Their methods of opening them are not new
1727.57s - 1731.29s |  And they are very insecure and they are not publicly available
1731.77s - 1737.97s |  so I decided to make that publicly available and this is the only place that I know of at which you can get that information and
1742.19s - 1746.31s |  That is that is it. Thank you for coming. Um, I
1747.01s - 1751.65s |  Really apologize for the technical difficulties and the convoluted explanations
1751.99s - 1759.51s |  But we will have in-person demonstrations. You can try yourself at the lock-picking village immediately after this. Thank you
