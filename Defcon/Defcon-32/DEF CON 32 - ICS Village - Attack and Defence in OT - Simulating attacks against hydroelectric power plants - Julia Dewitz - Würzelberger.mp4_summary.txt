**Introduction**
- Thanks for your interest in this talk.
- My name is **Julia**, and my colleagues, **Sarah** and **Bernhard**, will join me in discussing a joint project.

**Project Overview**
- The project is a **prototype** runoff river power plant, created by **Fabult**, an Austrian hydropower energy supplier, in collaboration with **Enviso**, a European security consulting company.
- The prototype visualizes the effects of a **cyber attack** on a power plant and serves as a **forensic training tool**.
- Over 30 people were involved in the project, including students from the Technical University in Vienna.

**Project Motivation**
- **Fabult**'s priority is **OT cybersecurity** as a critical infrastructure provider.
- The company plans to build a large **cybersecurity range** focused on OT in Styria, Austria, to train specialists.
- The prototype serves as a pilot for the larger cyber range.
- **Enviso** aims to strengthen customer security resilience by building realistic attack scenarios representing actual OT cyber threats.

**Project Objectives**
- **Awareness-building**: Targeting individuals with limited knowledge about cybersecurity.
- **Forensic training**: Providing specialists with a practical understanding of cyber attacks and their impacts.

**Project Challenges and Considerations**
- Collaborating remotely between Austria and Germany.
- Gaining input from internal colleagues and manufacturers to ensure an accurate representation of a hydropower plant.
- The importance of including a **control room** to monitor data and control the plant.
- The need for a backup and restore solution for consistent training environments.
- Managing noise levels by using passive components instead of active-cooled switches.
- Creating a realistic model, including a typical Austrian environment and a **Kaplan turbine**.

**Technical Details**
- The cyber range consists of two layers: the **scenario and visualization layer** and the **electric cabinet** with technical components.
- The scenario layer includes a modulated hydropower plant with a river, head and tail water, a turbine building, and wheels.
- An **HMI** (Human-Machine Interface) and a turbine model with shutters are added for practicality and visualization.
- The electric cabinet contains:
  - Basic components: contactor, electronic circuit breaker, power supply units (PSUs), and terminal blocks.
  - **PLCs** (Programmable Logic Controllers) and **Raspberry Pis**: The PLCs serve as the decision-making brain, and the Raspberry Pis act as remote IOs.
  - **Siemens BoxPC**: Used to drive the HMI.
- The PLCs and Raspberry Pis are connected via **Modbus**, while the HMI connects to the PLCs via **S7 COM**.
- Sensors and actuators, such as opening level sensors for wheels and shutters, connect to the Raspberry Pis via **I2C** and **GPIOs**.
- A **simulation layer** emulates water levels, with a simulation program publishing data to an **MQTT broker**.
- A **visualization machine** projects water levels onto the model using a projector and a Unity game.

**Network Infrastructure**
- The network is divided into **IT** and **OT** networks.
- The IT network is virtualized and emulates a classic office environment.
- The OT network includes a virtual and a physical network:
  - Physical network: Hosts the PLCs.
  - Virtual network: Hosts a virtualized active directory.

**Attack Scenario**
- The attack begins with a **phishing email**, tricking the victim into downloading malware containing an **SITU implant**.
- The attacker gains initial access to the IT network, dumps credentials, escalates privileges, and compromises the jump host and control technology DMC.
- By accessing the **Nextcloud datastore**, the attacker obtains project files for the PLCs, modifies them, and re-uploads them.

**Impact of the Attack**
- When the modified project files are deployed on the PLCs, it results in an immense flood affecting the power plant and its surroundings.

**Training and DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response)**
- The training is divided into 15 labs, covering analysis, attacker techniques, and OS-specific forensics.
- Trainees will learn about security engineering perspectives and Siemens toolbox file analyzation.

**Lessons Learned**
- The importance of easy-to-use and resilient **backup and restore solutions** for efficient training setups.
- The need for consistent backups of ESXi, graphics, and Raspberry Pi configurations.
- Noise management by using passive components instead of active-cooled switches.
- The art and technique of model building, including a realistic Kaplan turbine and a typical Austrian environment.
- Considerations for PCAP file size and analysis tools (Tshark vs. Wireshark) for OT operator familiarity.

**Attack Impact Explanation**
- The attacker manipulates the toolbox files to display target values as real values on the HMI, giving the operator a false sense of everything being fine.
- Meanwhile, the toolbox sends zeros to the wires, resulting in the flood as the wires stop functioning.
- The operator, relying on the HMI, may not have a direct visual of the power plant, making it challenging to detect the issue promptly.

**Conclusion**
- The team invites interested parties to connect and discuss further details about the range beyond the presentation.
