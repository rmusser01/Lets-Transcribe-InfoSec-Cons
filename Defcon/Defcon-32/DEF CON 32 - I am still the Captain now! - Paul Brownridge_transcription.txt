0.00s - 4.62s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 So good afternoon, everybody. And welcome. This is my amazing
4.62s - 7.42s |  in my second talk at DEF CON. It's such a privilege and honor
7.42s - 11.42s |  to talk once at DEF CON, but twice. It's just unbelievable.
11.74s - 14.58s |  So before I continue, I'd like to thank my colleagues, Kerry
14.58s - 20.42s |  Coburn, John Waksmanski, Mike Leonard, Ken, and yeah, the rest
20.42s - 24.38s |  of the P2P team that are here helping out. I couldn't have
24.38s - 27.74s |  done this presentation without them. So I got to do the
27.74s - 31.36s |  obligatory. Who am I? So my name is Paul Brownridge.
31.40s - 35.44s |  Obviously, I started my working life as an engineer in Cape Town
35.44s - 40.32s |  in South Africa. I have an OT background, then just by a
40.32s - 44.40s |  series of accidents, found myself into working in
44.40s - 48.74s |  cybersecurity. So I do a lot of OT testing, maritime, IoT, APIs, a
48.74s - 52.00s |  lot of interesting stuff. I mean, we do a lot of interesting
52.00s - 55.92s |  stuff. So quite topical, probably something that's been
55.92s - 60.34s |  talked about maybe five or six times at this conference is the
60.34s - 65.90s |  MV Dolly. Is it hacked? Well, there's a lot of lot of opinion
65.90s - 68.26s |  on on the internet, right? Everybody's an armchair warrior
68.26s - 71.90s |  at the end of the day. They reckon yes, it was hacked.
71.90s - 75.06s |  Definitely. It's deep state, etc. Other people say no, not
75.06s - 78.74s |  possible. I think that once you understand how ships are
78.74s - 82.50s |  architected, you understand actually that maybe the answer
82.50s - 85.10s |  is somewhere in the middle. And what I'm going to be doing is
85.10s - 88.64s |  going to be going through the individual systems, examining
88.64s - 92.80s |  some of the the attack surface and maybe some of the threat
92.80s - 98.12s |  vectors and that. So really sort of like a high level view of the
98.12s - 102.74s |  systems on the ship. So to be quite honest, you know, before I
102.74s - 105.08s |  came across this picture, I didn't know how much damage the
105.08s - 107.66s |  ship actually done, which is quite scary, isn't it? I mean,
107.66s - 111.08s |  that is a mess or somebody's not getting getting the bonuses
111.08s - 116.88s |  here. And okay, so let's start with the main engines. So the
116.88s - 121.72s |  picture that you see over there, that is a typical engine on a
121.72s - 126.48s |  container ship. It's one engine. It differs from other engines
126.48s - 129.56s |  that you're used to in that it's supported by ancillary system.
129.56s - 134.36s |  So there's pumps, for instance, they handle the cooling, the
134.36s - 139.04s |  fuel injection, etc. And these are handled by generators in
139.04s - 144.16s |  redundant arrays. The generators will power the
144.16s - 147.04s |  steering without any power. Obviously, there's no steering.
147.44s - 150.96s |  And this is all organized by the power management system. So the
150.96s - 157.48s |  PMS that is in turn, managed by a network control system called
157.48s - 160.52s |  the integrated alarm and monitoring system. And then you
160.52s - 164.12s |  have these multiple systems all over the ship that tie into it
164.16s - 168.84s |  by a series of either serial connections, either IP over
168.84s - 174.72s |  serial, etc. And we will take a look at those in turn. And of
174.72s - 177.68s |  course, we've got the steering controls, right? We have the
177.68s - 182.48s |  controls at the helm, tied into autopilot. And it's important to
182.48s - 185.28s |  note that at this time, there is a physical switch that if
185.28s - 189.04s |  anything goes wrong, you can turn that off. It's as we go
189.04s - 190.96s |  through these slides, it's something to note all the time
190.96s - 194.76s |  that is always going to be somebody in charge, which is
194.76s - 198.96s |  really important. So there we go the helm, the steering gear, the
198.96s - 202.92s |  steering flat, which is basically a deck that you can
202.92s - 206.32s |  steer the ship from any emergency situation, you can
206.32s - 210.52s |  manually control the ship in case anything goes wrong. All
210.52s - 213.56s |  right. Then of course, the systems tie into the rudder. And
213.56s - 215.88s |  the steering gear, as I mentioned the previous slide,
216.16s - 221.24s |  it's all tied in with the generator. So this is you can
221.24s - 223.12s |  see the picture on the left hand side. This is what you see in
223.12s - 225.52s |  the movies, right with the telegraph, you know, full steam
225.52s - 230.20s |  ahead. But on the right hand side, this is the more modern
230.20s - 233.64s |  derivation of that. It's important to note that a lot of
233.64s - 238.80s |  these systems are tied down to certain revs so that it doesn't
238.80s - 242.32s |  cause any potentially dangerous vibrations on the ship. Or
243.08s - 246.04s |  sometimes it's also economics as well, because a ship will have
246.04s - 251.16s |  a most economical, I can say, revolution band, and there'll be
251.16s - 253.60s |  tying into that. What's important to note that at any
253.60s - 257.04s |  time of this, yet again, the captain can override any of
257.04s - 262.84s |  these controls. So if there's a blackout on the ship, like what
262.84s - 265.44s |  happened to Emi Dali, right? What are the procedures to
265.44s - 267.92s |  restart this? Well, normally, it's as simple as pressing a
267.92s - 270.68s |  single button on the screen. But how do we do this when the rest
270.68s - 274.28s |  of the ship does not have any power, right? So it could
274.28s - 276.92s |  involve using controls local to the generator start. So you could
276.92s - 280.24s |  send your engineers down there, waiting for it to come up to
280.24s - 283.72s |  speed, and then closing breakers, for instance. And this
283.72s - 287.80s |  is important to note, because it's a process like any OT
287.80s - 291.92s |  system, any refinery, any chemical processes, everything
291.92s - 294.92s |  works in a sequence. There's no just like one button, bam, it
294.92s - 299.80s |  comes on. It's a series of processes. Sometimes you have
299.80s - 302.72s |  manual management of the system will need to be performed. As a
302.72s - 305.88s |  load is drawn by the ship, this would take 30 seconds normally,
305.88s - 309.92s |  but you never know, and it might take several. But according to
309.92s - 314.40s |  regulations, your emergency generator should come on 45
314.40s - 318.04s |  seconds. But as we all know, in the real world, right, that
318.04s - 321.72s |  hardly ever happens. I mean, that's the ideal state. So what
321.72s - 324.92s |  could take or is supposed to take 45 seconds could take
324.92s - 330.12s |  minutes. And if you are in the open sea, with a blackout, and
330.12s - 333.28s |  your ship is coasting, that is not a problem, right? But if
333.28s - 337.36s |  you're approaching a bridge or a built up system, just 45
337.40s - 340.28s |  seconds or even sometimes if these systems don't start, a
340.28s - 344.40s |  minute or two minutes can end in emergency, like we saw in the
344.40s - 349.76s |  previous slide. So what triggers a blackout? Well, bad fuel.
349.76s - 352.56s |  Yeah, some of the cheapy fuel that you pick up at these ports,
352.56s - 357.20s |  right? Ship rolling, some of the heavy seas can cause loss of
357.20s - 361.12s |  pressure and cause the ship to blackout. Electrical problems,
361.12s - 365.40s |  bad maintenance, etc, etc. It's long. The older the ship, the
365.40s - 370.68s |  worse these problems get. And cruise ships do blackout. 2013
370.68s - 375.76s |  Carnival Triumph was out of commission for a few days, due
375.76s - 380.08s |  to the battery power fail several times. In 2019, the
380.08s - 384.24s |  Viking Sky generator was out for service maintenance. Yet again,
384.24s - 386.76s |  we see this. So it's totally possible that these
386.76s - 392.60s |  circumstances can exist, that a ship can blackout. So like I
392.60s - 396.56s |  said, you know, all the armchair warriors on the internet saying
397.32s - 401.76s |  it was a hack. Well, we'll see. So let's take a look at the
401.76s - 407.76s |  autopilot. So as we go, as we saw a slide early on, the
407.76s - 413.32s |  autopilot can connect directly to the engine. But it's always
413.32s - 416.36s |  possible to disconnect the autopilot and steer manually. As
416.36s - 418.92s |  I said, this is very important. There's always a human in the
418.92s - 423.40s |  loop. But if we take a look at the threat landscape, we're
423.40s - 425.88s |  finding more and more that these systems are connected up to the
425.88s - 430.92s |  internet. So firmware downloads and that. And that if we sort of
430.92s - 433.80s |  break it down, and we can see this almost becomes like a sort
433.80s - 437.52s |  of supply chain attack. But then you'd have to compromise the
437.52s - 442.04s |  firmware supplies. You have to sign the firmware. So yes,
442.04s - 445.80s |  possible, but very unlikely, unless you really expend a lot
445.80s - 450.80s |  of energy going back and hacking the spyware. Propulsion, rarely
450.80s - 453.56s |  connected to the internet. These are big, big chunky machines.
453.84s - 457.80s |  This is your typical OT versus IT segregation at the end of the
457.80s - 462.64s |  day. Attacks unlikely. And if it did happen, the bridge could
462.64s - 466.08s |  manually override yet again, somebody, a person's in the
466.08s - 471.10s |  loop. The power systems frequently network connected,
471.10s - 474.86s |  fair enough. Right. And this is one of those, those, those
474.86s - 477.38s |  situations are just becoming more and more connected as the
477.38s - 480.78s |  years go by. But attack is unlikely in an event happening
480.78s - 483.70s |  the bridge could manually override. Yet this recurring
483.70s - 487.58s |  theme is that there's always somebody that can change a ship
487.58s - 492.82s |  or it's going to be on bridge, etc. So conclusion, yes, ships
492.82s - 495.62s |  can be hacked, but it takes time. It's a manual process,
495.66s - 502.02s |  whoopsie-daisy. And was the MVW hacked? Well, no. It's
502.02s - 505.82s |  practically impossible. I mean, it's possible, but it's very,
505.82s - 508.34s |  very improbable. You need a large amount of time over there.
509.06s - 511.06s |  You need to know the systems, you basically need to need
511.06s - 514.22s |  engineer, tons of social, social engineering. So for an
514.22s - 516.94s |  armchair hacker from, I don't know, your nation state
516.94s - 519.10s |  somewhere, like hacking into the ship, very improbable.
519.90s - 523.66s |  Unfortunately, polarized views from uninformed commentators do
523.66s - 526.30s |  not help. You need to understand how these ships are
526.30s - 535.90s |  architected. So last year, I had about 150 slides. And I managed
535.90s - 541.42s |  to get to 120 of them before time got called. So I blasted
541.42s - 545.02s |  through 30. So I'm going to do a recap of what I did last year.
545.10s - 552.38s |  And yeah, so this is the systems recap. Integrated Control and
552.38s - 555.10s |  Monitoring System. This is the brains, the eyes of the ship.
555.42s - 560.54s |  This controls the PLCs in the engine room, rider control,
560.54s - 564.78s |  power management, these extremely, extremely important
564.78s - 569.14s |  piece of equipment. Without it, the ship cannot operate. So from
569.14s - 572.74s |  an attacker's point of view, this is a high value target. So
572.74s - 574.62s |  it's something that we take a look at all the time while we're
574.62s - 579.82s |  busy pen testing ships. This is the ECDIS, the charting system.
580.54s - 585.34s |  This is these running redundant arrays. Basically, as you can
585.34s - 589.66s |  see, there's a map on there, it tells you where you are in on
589.66s - 595.22s |  the ocean. Obviously, without it, the captain could not know
595.22s - 597.18s |  where he's supposed to be going and the crew don't know where
597.18s - 599.66s |  they're going or where they are. So if these systems go down,
599.66s - 603.14s |  then the ship has got to stop. But failing that, simply with
603.14s - 607.38s |  some of the older ships, we got some old school maps, right? You
607.38s - 609.82s |  can see the drawers over there. Those are actually all charts
609.82s - 613.18s |  from the oceans around the world. And these get delivered
613.18s - 618.26s |  by hand whenever there's an update. So it's quite, it's
618.26s - 621.42s |  quite reassuring that you still have these manual methods of the
621.42s - 625.06s |  ship knowing where they are at the end of the day. Safety
625.06s - 629.26s |  management system. So this is a separate room, usually near the
629.26s - 636.70s |  bridge, that whenever there's an emergency situation on board, it
636.70s - 639.70s |  is organized over here. So this is very interesting from
639.70s - 642.98s |  attacker's point of view, because it has tendrils into
642.98s - 648.58s |  the rest of the ship. It is from the ICMS all the way to the
648.58s - 656.54s |  ectus, pressurized doors, CCTV, fire alarm systems. This is so
656.54s - 659.54s |  important at the end of the day, because you basically can
659.58s - 665.78s |  coordinate like somebody like with the lifeboats, etc. It's
666.38s - 669.98s |  something to note as well that as the crew is running around
669.98s - 674.38s |  trying to organize a emergency situation, they can use these
674.38s - 678.50s |  iPads or these window systems to log in and take a look at what's
678.50s - 683.72s |  going on at the same time. It's an idealized version of the IT
683.72s - 686.80s |  versus OT system of ship, we've got internet coming down by
686.80s - 690.36s |  VSAT into the core, we've got the corporate network, because
690.36s - 693.60s |  as usual, you got your bean counters on the ship, your
693.60s - 696.64s |  accountants and your people, then you got third parties,
696.64s - 702.08s |  something like point of sales, etc. And your crew is obviously
702.08s - 704.84s |  you know, you need to provide Netflix, etc. for your crew. And
704.84s - 708.28s |  that's split up into Wi Fi and wired. You can see the line down
708.28s - 713.80s |  the middle, you see the bridge and the engine room. And this is
713.84s - 717.96s |  what you want in the real world, but it doesn't always work out.
718.00s - 721.32s |  Because, yeah, we'll see a little bit later. This is really
721.32s - 725.76s |  how it looks like it's a mess. So it comes on the VSAT into the
725.76s - 729.40s |  core network, and then RDP, not their protocol, but remote
729.40s - 733.40s |  distribution points. And these are basically just big chunks of
733.40s - 735.96s |  Cisco equipment, we can see in the next slide. And these are
735.96s - 741.40s |  broken down via VLAN trunks into cabin switches. This is
741.40s - 744.60s |  basically what it looks like this on the ship. So you anybody
744.60s - 748.72s |  who's been in a data center, any on prem stuff, it looks exactly
748.72s - 752.48s |  the same. It's all off the shelf stuff. It's nothing bespoke for
752.48s - 759.48s |  the maritime industry. Breaking down further, we have the VLAN
759.48s - 764.16s |  trunking down to the cabin switches. And we have it split
764.16s - 769.88s |  off into TVs, VoIPs, light, Wi-Fi, CTV, TV. The most
769.88s - 773.72s |  important thing to remember on all this is it comes down over a
773.72s - 776.92s |  single connection, right? And as an attacker, that is very
776.92s - 780.68s |  interesting. So we got the propulsion system. This is
780.68s - 783.36s |  Azipod. In the olden days, you used to have the, you know, the
783.36s - 786.96s |  big rudders that used to, you have the prop wash. But now
786.96s - 791.16s |  these are independent systems that you can control from the
791.16s - 795.64s |  ICMS. And actually, the recent ones that we tested are
795.64s - 799.64s |  controlled by Wi-Fi, just normal 2.4 gig Wi-Fi, right? Which is
799.64s - 802.36s |  quite scary at the end of the day. This is not even dedicated
802.36s - 809.21s |  cables at the end of the day. So yeah. So one of the things
809.21s - 813.53s |  when we test ships is we walk around, this goes back to my
813.53s - 816.73s |  early days in refinery, is you see pipes everywhere, you see
816.73s - 818.33s |  cables going everywhere, you don't know where everything is.
818.33s - 822.45s |  So you spend such a large amount of time chasing stuff down. And
823.05s - 827.37s |  because ships have this churn of engineers, etc., a lot of
827.37s - 830.97s |  people don't know where the systems do, or even sometimes
830.97s - 833.21s |  they leave the systems on, because they're too afraid to
833.21s - 834.65s |  turn them off, because they don't know what it does, but
834.65s - 836.49s |  they don't want to turn it off at the end of the day, right? So
836.49s - 838.61s |  in case something goes wrong, it's like, okay, cool. So you
838.61s - 842.33s |  have systems just running like this constantly. So we knew
842.33s - 846.21s |  there was something coming in that monitored the fuel
846.53s - 849.29s |  consumption. But we didn't know where it was, right? So
849.61s - 853.41s |  eventually we opened up the panels, and we put it inside,
853.73s - 857.53s |  and we found this little bugger over here. This is like a
857.53s - 861.85s |  rugged PC. It's a Windows-based PC. But we wanted to know more
861.85s - 865.25s |  of what it did, right? So you can see on the side over there,
867.05s - 870.01s |  anybody who worked with OT systems a lot, you'll recognize
870.01s - 872.53s |  that little box over there. That's an IP to serial
872.53s - 875.93s |  connector. So what it does, it takes IP, Internet Protocol,
876.41s - 884.37s |  then it changes it into serial bus. Now the thing is when you
884.37s - 888.85s |  work in OT at the moment, these systems have been around for 30,
888.85s - 892.53s |  40 years, and they still operate on discrete systems. So this is
892.53s - 899.09s |  why you have the IP to serial. So we wanted to model the attack
899.09s - 903.93s |  surface and that. So what we did is we took a look. So we knew
903.93s - 906.97s |  that the IP to serial was going to the bridge ICMS. This was
906.97s - 912.21s |  going to the charting system. So it would track where we were at
912.21s - 914.93s |  a certain time from one distance to the next. But it was also
914.93s - 918.45s |  talking to the PLCs on the main engine. It was asking for
918.45s - 921.09s |  revolutions a second. It was asking for maybe fuel
921.09s - 925.93s |  consumption. And then it was doing some fancy mathematics.
925.93s - 931.13s |  It was predicting the fuel consumption. So what we did is
931.13s - 934.85s |  once we took a look at the IP to serial connection going to the
934.85s - 938.69s |  bridge, we noticed that instead of three wires, you can see
938.69s - 942.21s |  there's two wires. There's the ground and one of the serial
942.21s - 945.73s |  connections in there. We noticed that one of the wires was
945.73s - 950.01s |  missing. So usually when you have a serial to serial
950.01s - 954.21s |  connection, you pull the PLC or the piece of equipment and it
954.21s - 957.05s |  will talk back to you. But that's how it would normally
957.05s - 959.85s |  happen. What we found is it was transmit only. So the piece of
959.85s - 963.25s |  equipment was just taking from the bridge, which is great. From
963.25s - 965.53s |  attackers point of view, there's nothing you can do. You can't
965.53s - 969.45s |  inject anything down the line. Fantastic, right? But then we
969.45s - 973.01s |  started taking a look at the connection from the IP to serial
973.01s - 977.25s |  to the PLC. And that was using Modbus. Now Modbus, five
977.25s - 982.89s |  minutes. Seriously? All right. So it's using Modbus, right? And
982.89s - 987.37s |  Modbus was, that went quickly, right? And Modbus is like a, you
987.41s - 989.97s |  have to call out to the piece of equipment for it to broadcast
989.97s - 994.13s |  its value to you. So this is, this is interesting from
994.13s - 996.57s |  attacker's point of view because now we have access to the
996.57s - 1000.57s |  machine. So now we can inject values into the PLCs at the end
1000.57s - 1003.05s |  of the day. And in terms of attack surface, this is very
1003.05s - 1007.69s |  interesting to us. However, what was more interesting, forgive
1007.69s - 1010.33s |  like I said, I got lots of slides, right? So what was more
1010.33s - 1013.17s |  interesting, we took a look at the system and we noticed we had
1013.17s - 1019.53s |  TeamViewer on there, right? So yeah, yeah. I mean, what is more
1019.53s - 1023.21s |  amusing, even more amusing, was that the fact that the company
1023.21s - 1025.85s |  actually had stopped paying for the service four years before,
1025.85s - 1027.81s |  right? But they were too afraid to turn it off, like I was
1027.81s - 1032.33s |  saying before. So you had a machine that was not updated. It
1032.33s - 1036.53s |  was still connected to the internet. You could potentially
1036.53s - 1039.17s |  connect up to the PLC and ruin everything at the end of the
1039.17s - 1043.57s |  day, right? So it was, we found this very amusing. But it was
1043.57s - 1048.05s |  good. I, yeah, I'm going to have to blast through my slides
1048.05s - 1052.41s |  again. I'm really sorry about this, guys. But how many
1052.41s - 1065.83s |  minutes? Three minutes? Two minutes? Okay. Shit. Okay. So I'm
1065.83s - 1069.35s |  going to blast through my slides quick. Next year when you come
1069.35s - 1071.55s |  and see me talk, I'll do this properly. I'll do this first so
1071.71s - 1077.51s |  I can actually get through this time. Basically, TLDR, we
1077.51s - 1081.75s |  managed to compromise the trusses system from our cabins
1081.75s - 1087.53s |  at the end of the day. So I'm going to run to the conclusion.
1087.53s - 1099.46s |  Those are really interesting slides, aren't they? Sorry,
1099.46s - 1107.78s |  guys. See TeamViewer again? Yeah. Okay. So I'm going to hack
1107.78s - 1110.38s |  it up. So I actually had some stuff about regulation as well,
1110.38s - 1112.54s |  but that's very boring. Nobody wants to go through that. Okay.
1113.18s - 1120.22s |  So ships can be hacked, but it takes time and it takes
1120.22s - 1122.98s |  presence. One of the things that we noticed that we have the
1122.98s - 1125.26s |  advantage of when we're on the ship, we can talk to engineers,
1125.50s - 1128.06s |  we can look at the documentation, right? We can see
1128.06s - 1131.82s |  what's going on. We can run the lines. In an idealized world,
1132.58s - 1136.06s |  hackers are not going to sit on the other side of the world, go
1136.06s - 1138.82s |  through the V set, take over the vessel. It's not going to
1138.82s - 1143.38s |  happen. However, social engineering is still a factor
1143.38s - 1147.50s |  that is something to consider. Convergence and modernization
1147.50s - 1150.34s |  often introduce new risk. And this is true because a lot of
1150.34s - 1152.58s |  the time we're getting IP to serial. Before we had discrete
1152.58s - 1157.94s |  systems, now we have trunking, like we said before, and it's
1157.94s - 1161.38s |  possible to RDP onto systems, et cetera, to TeamViewer, right?
1162.30s - 1165.06s |  There's undocumented stuff everywhere. This is one of the
1165.06s - 1169.58s |  things when we test the ship, we have a little AP, AP
1169.58s - 1173.54s |  monitoring, and the client or the vendor has installed so many
1173.54s - 1177.18s |  access points, right? That the client that we're testing have
1177.18s - 1181.90s |  no idea what the hell is going on. Probably about six or seven
1181.90s - 1185.78s |  undocumented APs on a ship at any one time, right? Which is
1185.78s - 1188.90s |  bonkers, right? Because I mean, all of these just bridge the man
1188.90s - 1193.46s |  over there. It's like, yeah. It's yeah, so it's crazy. And
1193.46s - 1196.50s |  that's it. Thank you for coming to see my talk.
