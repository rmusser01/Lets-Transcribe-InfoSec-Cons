  "description": "Cybersecurity red teams have myriad ways of practicing their skills - from CTFs to certifications - but how do you train for physical red teaming? This talk will focus on leveling up your body - add new abilities to climb, sneak, jump, and become an unstoppable ninja while performing physical penetration tests. We\u2019ll talk about which abilities you need, and how we train ourselves (and our staff) for performing at our peak for physical engagements. This will be complemented by plenty of war stories and lessons learned in the field for what abilities are most worth leveling up in, and comparisons between red teaming before and after our weight loss. We\u2019ll then discuss different exercises and habits that the audience can start doing as soon as in your hotel room to improve your lives and your ability to break into buildings!",

0.02s - 5.82s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 So welcome everyone. I'm impressed at the size of the audience who came out, took
5.82s - 9.86s |  time out of your hacker talk, hacker con to listen to two of us talk about gym for
9.86s - 16.06s |  half an hour. So we're going to end with that and how you can train yourself up
16.06s - 21.66s |  but I'll start by talking about why and what specifically we're looking to
21.66s - 26.22s |  train towards for physical red teaming. So we're going to talk about hacking
26.22s - 30.50s |  physical spaces with the human body, using the human body for things that it
30.50s - 34.22s |  might not necessarily be designed to do or meant to do and that the physical
34.22s - 39.14s |  spaces we occupy were not or did not contemplate within their security model
39.14s - 42.58s |  and then we'll talk about red team fitness and how to train yourself up for
42.58s - 47.70s |  it. So brute force and we'll show you a couple fun examples of that and how
47.70s - 51.98s |  without even any tools you can get through some locked spaces. Fences,
51.98s - 57.06s |  climbing, spelunking, speed, rope work, all of that in order to get from the
57.06s - 62.97s |  outside to whatever the crown jewels are. So deformation and latching mechanisms
62.97s - 66.29s |  and frames and this is something that we talk about in the physical security
66.29s - 72.09s |  village every year in bypass 101. We've got a cool video of it that we're going
72.09s - 77.97s |  to be releasing this con as well. Particularly double doors with a pole in
77.97s - 80.53s |  between the two of them and we'll see how that works.
80.53s - 85.25s |  Lifting heavy garage doors is something you can do as well. So if a building is
85.25s - 91.73s |  locked but there's a garage door, oftentimes there's access control on the
91.73s - 96.53s |  motor that lifts that up but there's nothing actually to pin it shut and so
96.53s - 101.89s |  you just reach down and with sufficient force you can lift the bottom segments
101.89s - 108.49s |  of that high enough to roll under and let yourself in. Pulling a door to the
108.49s - 112.93s |  side in its frame which will then disengage the latch from the frame
112.93s - 117.37s |  itself and lifting and pulling to unpin double latch doors. So we'll go
117.37s - 122.89s |  through all of that. So here here's the the image of what happens when you just
122.89s - 127.49s |  take a door like this and pull it hard enough and so you'll see that that post
127.49s - 132.61s |  that's between the two double doors actually deforms to the side and the
132.61s - 136.97s |  latch then pops in because the door is now deformed and it's able to do that
136.97s - 143.45s |  and so just by grabbing the handle and pulling hard enough towards you and
143.45s - 148.61s |  using your body weight to support that leverage you can actually force open a
148.61s - 157.29s |  lot of commercial doors of this design with no tools whatsoever. When a door has
157.29s - 162.73s |  no center mullion and it's pinned at the top and bottom very similar things
162.73s - 167.69s |  happen except the door bows out when you pull it and that's actually enough to
167.69s - 172.69s |  pop out of the frame and pull the door open just by brute force. So this is
172.69s - 176.01s |  something that on pest pen testing engagements it's one of the first things
176.01s - 181.01s |  we check for is can someone just pull the door hard enough and oftentimes you
181.01s - 187.17s |  can and that's that's a big problem because threat model wise anyone can do
187.17s - 190.93s |  it and and people do and and we've worked a bunch of cases where that was
190.93s - 196.73s |  actually the case and there was a break-in and and that's how they got in.
196.89s - 203.29s |  Climbing is another thing so often we'll we'll complain about windows not having
203.29s - 206.11s |  adequate locks and they'll say oh well they do on the first floor well the
206.11s - 208.69s |  first floor isn't the only thing you have to consider and so when you have
208.69s - 215.05s |  this rustication on the on the masonry here that provides a perfect set of
215.05s - 221.01s |  hand grips to lift yourself up and get to the second story window. Scaffolding as
221.01s - 225.61s |  well so always be considering construction and what's happening in the
225.61s - 230.25s |  transitionary stages of a building and you can climb up scaffolding even up to
230.25s - 236.09s |  a second window or all the way up to the roof and oftentimes once you're onto the
236.09s - 240.01s |  roof you can get back into the building because that door is now in the exit
240.01s - 245.05s |  direction as far as the security was considered. False floors of course so
245.05s - 248.57s |  secure or so server rooms tend to use false floors to run the cabling under
248.57s - 253.93s |  them pop that open slide underneath and and access the server room false
253.93s - 259.41s |  ceilings we'll show you a video of that in a moment and and generally getting
259.41s - 262.89s |  around the exterior of buildings as a way to get to the interior in
262.89s - 269.93s |  unintended ways. So scaffolding as well this was we're we're from up in Canada
269.93s - 274.09s |  this was the the 2019 Raptors celebration in Toronto and all
274.09s - 279.21s |  scaffolding all around the city was completely inundated with people and so
279.21s - 283.37s |  that's something that's that does happen and of course you've got a whole lot of
283.37s - 287.13s |  distractions for the police if someone wanted to break in during an event like
287.13s - 295.01s |  this. So false ceilings this is something that you're aware of from a bypass
295.01s - 299.73s |  perspective that you need to harden that ceiling that someone can pop the false
299.73s - 303.89s |  ceiling out and climb over from a red teamers perspective though if you want
303.89s - 308.17s |  to take advantage of that you need to be fit enough to do it and so that involves
308.17s - 313.81s |  getting up there moving it out of the way not damaging these relatively
313.81s - 318.37s |  delicate thin aluminum ceiling brackets getting yourself up through and over
318.37s - 322.25s |  actually being able to fit through whatever holes there and drop down on
322.25s - 327.33s |  the other side. So it takes quite a bit of a physical ability that not a lot of
327.33s - 335.49s |  people have to do that. And then just climbing in general so big beefy gate to
336.01s - 340.61s |  block out this door but you can climb over it if you're able to do that.
340.61s - 346.01s |  Pipe shafts is another thing so we do a lot of assessments of offices that are
346.01s - 350.89s |  renting out a space in a high-rise building with other offices and if
350.89s - 356.45s |  someone can get to your much less secure downstairs neighbor access a pipe shaft
356.45s - 360.65s |  utility shaft elevator shaft whatever it might be from that less secure office
360.65s - 365.13s |  they can then climb up to yours pop themselves out in a mechanical room which
365.13s - 370.73s |  is deep within the core of your office and have at it from there. But again from
370.73s - 375.09s |  a red team perspective in order to take advantage of this you need to be fit
375.09s - 385.55s |  enough to squeeze in and scale up. Of course fences as well. Fences I mean we
385.55s - 391.67s |  the way over is obvious so we always harp on it that fences keep honest
391.67s - 396.59s |  people honest there's always a way over. In this case they got the barbed wire
396.59s - 400.71s |  right here but what the hell is this pole doing there it completely defeats
400.71s - 404.19s |  the purpose of that barbed wire and we'll show you in a minute what what
404.19s - 410.07s |  consequence that has. You can often untie the top squeeze the two parts apart and
410.07s - 413.75s |  squeeze through or even pull up the bottom wire of the fence which takes
413.75s - 417.55s |  some strength to do and you need to be able to fit under it but if you're able
417.55s - 424.47s |  to do that that's the way past those. So here's a quick video of that right
424.47s - 429.23s |  barbed wire fence but because of that fence post it completely defeats the
429.23s - 432.83s |  purpose of that barbed wire. Brace yourself against the fence post don't
432.83s - 436.87s |  know why that video didn't finish. Brace yourself against the fence post and
436.87s - 442.91s |  climb over bypassing the barbed wire entirely jump down the other side. So
442.91s - 446.95s |  that was a two or that was a five second bypass there of this barbed wire fence.
446.95s - 452.87s |  And of course if a fence is properly designed it does not have a post you can
452.91s - 458.83s |  grab you can throw a thick wool blanket over that and and use the barbed wire to
458.83s - 463.23s |  to support yourself that way. So so there's ways around it but you got to be
463.23s - 468.63s |  fit enough to do it. Cases like this these are common in garages and retail
468.63s - 473.67s |  protection they provide a nice little ladder themselves it's small you got to
473.67s - 478.43s |  be able to grab and and get your toes in there but you climb up swing yourself
478.43s - 482.67s |  around the top and that's a way in as well but of course you got to be able to
482.67s - 488.47s |  climb and you got to be able to fit. And so this is something that I I used to be
488.47s - 492.35s |  a hundred pounds fatter and so when I was doing red team engagements in that
492.35s - 497.61s |  shape we'd find situations with fences that you could pull up there was a gap
497.61s - 501.67s |  in the bottom cases where it abutted the wall of a building we could pull it
501.67s - 506.71s |  apart and squeeze through or thin gaps like this and and on our team we started
506.71s - 509.91s |  calling them fatty filters because everyone else was able to squeeze
509.91s - 515.59s |  through and then damn Billy has to find some other way around. So I'm able to get
515.59s - 518.99s |  through more of the fatty filters now but that's something as well that often
518.99s - 524.79s |  it's just a thin space that you have to squeeze through. An interesting example
524.79s - 527.95s |  of this and for those who are not familiar with it I encourage you to look
527.95s - 533.49s |  up the 2015 Clinton State Correctional Facility escape. So this was a high
533.49s - 539.27s |  profile escape where they used a number of impressive techniques to get out they
539.27s - 543.71s |  popped through the back of their cell into the pipe chase behind it which
543.71s - 547.43s |  supports the plumbing for their toilets and from there climbed down into the
547.43s - 552.31s |  steam tunnels below and so those tunnels were at times very tight difficult to
552.31s - 555.31s |  squeeze through you've got to be able to lift yourself squeeze yourself and
555.31s - 559.75s |  position yourself to get through it. The most impressive part was the escape
559.75s - 563.75s |  through the prison wall itself where they waited until July when the steam
563.75s - 568.83s |  was turned off and actually cut into the steam pipe and squeezed through the
568.83s - 572.67s |  inside of the steam pipe to get through that eight foot thick concrete wall and
572.67s - 578.99s |  then from within the steam pipe cut their way out on the other side and and
578.99s - 583.99s |  there were two two prisoners that made that escape one of which did most of the
583.99s - 589.15s |  manual labor there while the other did some of the social aspects of it but but
589.15s - 592.79s |  the second one was a bit more heavy set and he almost didn't make it just
592.79s - 598.03s |  because of the diameter of this pipe. So another thing thing to think about from
598.03s - 601.51s |  a threat modeling perspective when you've got high security correctional
601.51s - 606.19s |  facilities for people getting out and similar ideas for people getting in. The
606.19s - 611.03s |  the US military has standards for the maximum diameter of any utility pipe
611.03s - 614.95s |  bypassing a secure perimeter for exactly this reason and so you have to either
614.95s - 618.99s |  put reinforced grates across it or split it up into multiple pipes to prevent
618.99s - 624.34s |  someone from getting in that way. And then false ceilings as well this one you
624.34s - 630.10s |  get a bit of a leg up because we have a roof hatch ladder right on the one side
630.10s - 637.90s |  so we're popping up there and instead of going to the hatch climbing out into the
637.90s - 644.40s |  attic on the other side and you see there's a lot of utilities a lot of
644.40s - 650.28s |  sharp things a lot of delicate delicate supports to avoid there pop the ceiling
650.28s - 665.62s |  tile out on the secure side of that door and then drop our way down. So there's a
665.62s - 668.46s |  whole lot of control you have to have over your body and a whole lot of upper
668.46s - 675.50s |  body strength to be able to do that successfully. And so ladders in general
675.50s - 681.22s |  you see cages trying to prevent you from climbing them without without unlocking
681.22s - 685.98s |  it here sometimes they're badly designed and you can just climb the back and it's
685.98s - 689.50s |  still just a ladder but when that's not the case you got to be able to climb
689.50s - 693.06s |  that cage which is not particularly difficult to do if you train up for it.
693.06s - 698.51s |  And then sometimes it's too far you don't have enough handholds and you can
698.51s - 703.03s |  do rope work to get up and down so being able to repel being able to do a
703.03s - 708.43s |  rope ascender is something as well that that we can use in various circumstances.
708.43s - 714.47s |  And then the last relevant aspect is speed. So it does not matter if you set
714.47s - 719.75s |  off every alarm if you're gone by the time security arrives. So a couple
719.75s - 726.03s |  examples of that happening these are all all Apple stores that that got robbed in
726.19s - 736.74s |  this case 12 seconds. Come in start grabbing things and then run back out
736.74s - 773.06s |  and now the employees are catching on. Very similar case 12 seconds $27,000
773.06s - 781.74s |  take and so being able to pull that door open get through even if you set off an
781.74s - 786.66s |  alarm get to the crown jewels pull them out and make your exfiltration
786.70s - 792.34s |  successfully. No guards gonna be able to show up within 12 seconds unless they're
792.34s - 799.98s |  already on site and you do see that in most burglaries is there criminals know
799.98s - 804.98s |  to be in and out within five minutes if they can do that they're gonna evade any
804.98s - 809.86s |  security that might respond to them being there and so being able to do
809.86s - 813.38s |  these bypasses do these forcible entries do these climbing whatever you have to
813.38s - 821.18s |  do to get in and back out again in a quick period of time is is important. So
821.18s - 824.30s |  now I'll hand it over to Lucas who's gonna talk about how you can train
824.30s - 830.22s |  yourself up to be capable of all these things. Hi so I'm Lucas and briefly for
830.22s - 833.26s |  the second half of this presentation we're going to be going over the health
833.26s - 837.46s |  effects of fitness the fundamental movements and movement patterns of the
837.46s - 840.94s |  human body and how to do workout planning in order to increase your
840.94s - 845.18s |  capacity for red team engagements. So one thing I first want to show you is
845.18s - 848.90s |  the math of exercise and why it's an important routine to have or adds to your
848.90s - 856.22s |  daily life. Studies often you say that it is recommended to get 75 to 100 or 150
856.22s - 861.70s |  minutes this is an hour sorry 150 minutes per week of moderate to intense
861.70s - 866.86s |  to severe exercise and if you can do that one minute of exercising at this
866.86s - 870.78s |  rate in studies gives you two and a half minutes of additional life so if you
870.78s - 874.70s |  subtract out the one minute that you spend exercising let's every second you
874.70s - 878.14s |  spend exercising you get or every minute you spend exercising that's an
878.14s - 883.06s |  additional 90 minutes of bonus life and you'll be a fit old person as well and
883.06s - 886.46s |  it's there I'm not sure about studies that like look at the upper limits of
886.46s - 890.44s |  this but it's pretty hard to overdo it unless you're like basically training is
890.44s - 894.42s |  like a full-time athlete. So here's the study where I got that math from if
894.42s - 900.78s |  anyone wants to note down the DOI. So what is physical fitness? It is an
900.78s - 904.54s |  aggregate of several several different diverse metrics including your cardio
904.54s - 910.34s |  and aerobic capacity so how long you can run for and do cardio. Pure strength so
910.34s - 915.30s |  just how much you can lift even going slow at a slow rate. Power and explosive
915.30s - 919.50s |  capacity so how much you can like how high you can jump and how much weight
919.50s - 924.22s |  you can push very fast in a short period of time. As well as endurance so how long
924.22s - 929.86s |  you can keep doing a certain hard workload for and flexibility. I've got
929.86s - 935.78s |  different examples of all those here on the GIFs. So resistance training is a
935.78s - 941.62s |  very important part of physical exercise. In the past different Olympians and
941.62s - 944.78s |  other sports people would just train specifically for their sport because it
944.78s - 948.06s |  was thought okay if I just do running I'll just practice running forever.
948.06s - 952.42s |  However it's under the fear that if you spent too much time doing weight
952.46s - 955.66s |  training you'd become muscle bound and too much of an inflexible muscle head
955.66s - 959.58s |  who couldn't do anything except for like lift heavy rocks. But most athletes
959.58s - 962.58s |  nowadays generally follow a split where they're doing a large amount of
962.58s - 967.14s |  resistance training just generic strength training in the gym as well as
967.14s - 970.86s |  a small amount of a smaller amount of time dedicated to their sports specific
970.86s - 974.42s |  training when they're at higher levels. So because of that a lot of the
974.42s - 978.78s |  preparing for the red team physical fitness is just the same as being an
978.78s - 984.02s |  athlete which is doing weighted resistance training. So yeah there is no
984.02s - 987.26s |  muscle bound syndrome and the more weight you can lift and the more
987.26s - 991.70s |  strength training you do that generally increases your flexibility and joint
991.70s - 995.18s |  health and many many other things. And versus in the past it was worried that
995.18s - 998.46s |  if you became too much like Arnold Schwarzenegger you wouldn't be able to do
998.46s - 1003.06s |  much else. And here's an example of a famous Greek powerlifter named Kyriakos
1003.06s - 1007.30s |  Grizzly. This is a 400 pound man who can do the splits. So just demonstrating that
1007.30s - 1013.90s |  strength and flexibility and cardio are not orthogonal at all. Now there are
1013.90s - 1018.38s |  seven fundamental movements of the human body according to kinesiologists. There's
1018.38s - 1022.70s |  push motions so like doing push-ups or the bench press or the overhead press.
1022.70s - 1028.50s |  There are pull motions like pull-ups. There's the squat which involves just
1028.50s - 1032.74s |  knee bending. And then there's the hip hinge where your knees don't bend at all
1032.74s - 1037.90s |  but you just lean over this way so like the deadlift. There's the twist
1037.90s - 1042.70s |  clockwise as a fundamental movement and then the tists anti-clockwise. These
1042.70s - 1047.58s |  both count as two separate ones. And then the last movement is the farmer's carry
1047.58s - 1051.10s |  which to me doesn't seem like a movement. It's just when you're carrying heavy
1051.10s - 1056.66s |  weights and walking like this but according to kinesiologists it is. So
1056.66s - 1060.42s |  traditional strength and resistance training is meant to work these seven
1060.42s - 1065.74s |  fundamental movements. So one of the most important ones is the deadlift which is
1065.74s - 1070.38s |  just lifting a heavy thing off the ground. It involves a ton of back muscles
1070.38s - 1077.58s |  and your entire anterior chain and is mostly a hip hinge motion. Other gym
1077.58s - 1083.66s |  movements include, oops, the bench press which is our horizontal pressing motion.
1083.66s - 1092.09s |  Oh geez. The barbell row which is a pulling motion. So instead of pushing the
1092.09s - 1098.78s |  weight away we're pulling it away or pulling it towards us. The overhead press
1098.78s - 1104.98s |  so we have a vertical push motion and this works the shoulders mainly. Oops. And
1104.98s - 1109.50s |  then pull-ups which is a vertical pull. So here we've got horizontal push,
1109.50s - 1114.02s |  horizontal pull, vertical push, vertical pull, hip hinge, and squat. And if you just
1114.02s - 1119.14s |  train just these five exercises this vastly improves your whole body
1119.14s - 1123.10s |  strength and coordination because all of these movements are compounds that are
1123.10s - 1127.26s |  using many many muscle groups. So like you don't just need to go and just do
1127.26s - 1131.22s |  bicep curls. In this case doing these heavy compound movements that use many
1131.22s - 1135.10s |  many muscles and require a lot of coordination improves your overall joint
1135.10s - 1141.81s |  health and strength massively. And one that I'd like to emphasize importantly
1141.81s - 1146.73s |  is the deadlift. So the deadlift is basically every time I check and try and
1146.73s - 1149.69s |  remove this from my workout routine according to science there's just too
1149.69s - 1153.57s |  many positive things it does in such a short period of time. There's basically
1153.57s - 1157.01s |  no other exercise that works as many muscles as the deadlift in a shorter
1157.01s - 1162.17s |  period of time. And even in the studies where they try out various different
1162.17s - 1167.29s |  antidepressants and and and like exercises like running and SSRIs and all
1167.29s - 1170.89s |  of these different things that in I've seen various studies where the deadlift
1170.89s - 1177.37s |  just drastically outperforms every other treatment that was applied. It also fixes
1177.37s - 1181.85s |  your grip strength and massively boosts that and your forearm strength. It
1181.85s - 1186.41s |  completely fixes your posture because on the back there you have all these spinal
1186.41s - 1189.85s |  erectors. So if you're like us and you spend a lot of time at your computer
1189.85s - 1193.61s |  with a with like chronically bad posture like this the deadlift forces you to
1193.61s - 1199.37s |  snap that up and have a straight back. It's also good for fixing back pain
1199.37s - 1203.73s |  despite the fact that it looks like it would snap your lower back if you don't
1203.73s - 1206.45s |  learn the movements and how to tighten up and stuff. So it does take a little
1206.45s - 1210.49s |  bit to learn the form but there's basically no other single compound
1210.49s - 1214.85s |  movement you can do that is effective at fixing everything in your body at once.
1214.85s - 1220.25s |  And another one is squatting. I like this article called squatting is as
1220.25s - 1225.69s |  essential as brushing your teeth. So I wanted to read a bit of this. The deep
1225.69s - 1230.89s |  squat from a joint hygiene perspective is akin to brushing our teeth. We do not
1230.89s - 1235.37s |  simply brush the top one day, the bottom another day, and the side or back
1235.37s - 1238.89s |  whenever we feel like it. We brush every angle of our teeth every day. From my
1238.89s - 1242.09s |  perspective the deep squat movement is a toothbrush for our joints ensuring
1242.09s - 1245.53s |  they're all moving without sticking over restricted areas. And I took this
1245.53s - 1249.21s |  stuff a little bit too seriously because whenever I brush my teeth I try to do it
1249.21s - 1255.21s |  in a deep squat in order just to multitask. And actually so four
1255.21s - 1259.05s |  years ago I actually couldn't get into a deep squat like this. It literally took
1259.05s - 1262.25s |  me like several months of practicing. I go down as far as I can without
1262.25s - 1266.13s |  compromising my form and it took me like two months to even just be able to get
1266.13s - 1269.89s |  down here. So don't worry. All you have to do is keep working at it and every day
1269.89s - 1276.33s |  trying harder to get into that deep squat. Another aspect is cardio. As
1276.33s - 1281.25s |  you saw from the store or the videos of people hitting the Apple stores, it's
1281.25s - 1285.73s |  very important to be able to run fast. This can take many forms including
1285.73s - 1290.65s |  jogging, bicycling, swimming, dancing, or whatever makes you personally feel the
1290.65s - 1296.09s |  most comfortable doing it. This also increases your VO2 max which is how much
1296.09s - 1302.77s |  oxygen you can take into your lungs and how efficiently you can use it. One
1302.77s - 1306.57s |  aspect of cardio that is beneficial for your health, instead of just doing normal
1306.57s - 1311.09s |  steady state cardio and going jogging for a marathon for hours, it's probably
1311.09s - 1315.85s |  best for your health scientifically to try and do very intense sprints whenever
1315.85s - 1320.29s |  you can. So very high intensity intervals for 30 seconds and then you rest for a
1320.29s - 1324.33s |  minute or two and then do another 30 second all-out sprint. There's a
1324.33s - 1328.73s |  bunch of reasons that this levels up your mitochondria which is the
1328.73s - 1337.26s |  powerhouse of the cell. So yeah. So that's our general resistance training. The 20%
1337.26s - 1341.78s |  specific training that we want to do as Red Teamers basically focuses around
1341.78s - 1346.78s |  climbing. So this uses a lot of upper back and being able to do a pull-up is
1346.78s - 1350.46s |  is very, very useful for Red Team engagements because most of the exploits
1350.46s - 1356.38s |  we're doing involve just climbing over and around things. Climbing works a lot
1356.38s - 1360.02s |  of different areas of your body and has a lot of carryover effects to other
1360.02s - 1364.98s |  other things. And there are lots of ways you can do this from rock climbing to
1364.98s - 1374.32s |  bouldering, pull-ups, and parkour. However one particular item that I'm a fan of is
1374.32s - 1378.84s |  kettlebells which if I can only have one item for the gym it would be the
1379.24s - 1383.08s |  kettlebell. This I got really into these during COVID when all the gyms were
1383.08s - 1387.60s |  closed because it's just a tiny full comprehensive thing that fits in your
1387.60s - 1392.08s |  closet. So like just taking a kettlebell and swinging it up here and catching it
1392.08s - 1396.36s |  at the top is a full body movement that uses basically every single muscle in
1396.36s - 1400.24s |  your body. So just doing repetition kettlebell snatches for 10 minutes a day
1400.24s - 1403.48s |  is a full body workout. You don't need to worry about all these other complicated
1403.48s - 1407.28s |  movements. However if you're an ultra minimalist and you're stuck in your
1407.32s - 1411.48s |  hotel room for example you can't really go wrong with just burpees and body
1411.48s - 1415.48s |  weight squats. These are also just full body exercises that don't use any
1415.48s - 1418.48s |  equipment whatsoever that you can do anywhere just if you're in a prison
1418.48s - 1424.32s |  cell a hotel room or etc. Going slightly more advanced in the calisthenics area
1424.32s - 1428.64s |  if you can do dip bars and pull-ups just doing those are also pretty
1428.64s - 1433.00s |  comprehensive movements. And if you're feeling very advanced the one-arm push-up
1433.00s - 1437.16s |  the one leg squat and handstand push-ups are just like the limit of what you can
1437.16s - 1441.96s |  do with just purely your own body weight no equipment required. So a note
1441.96s - 1445.20s |  on habit formation if exercise is not already a part of your life and we've
1445.20s - 1449.12s |  convinced you that it should be remember that consistency is key so you just need
1449.12s - 1453.04s |  to pick something that you want to do whether that's sports resistance
1453.04s - 1457.36s |  training just going on daily walks after dinner or dancing or anything else. Only
1457.36s - 1461.52s |  an ounce of discipline is required to change your life. In this case most
1461.52s - 1464.64s |  people who go to the gym compulsively don't feel impressed that they do it
1464.64s - 1467.32s |  they have a habit and it would feel weird for them not to do it. There was
1467.32s - 1472.88s |  only about one brief period of habit formation where they it's sorry where
1472.88s - 1477.68s |  they actually need to apply discipline and do something you don't want. So yeah
1477.68s - 1481.96s |  the conclusion is try and get your 150 minutes a week of exercise for maximum
1481.96s - 1486.52s |  life extension but do whatever is easiest for you to do and maintain
1486.52s - 1491.72s |  consistently and discipline is freedom. Thank you.
