  "description": "I recently googled the meaning of \u201cencryption\u201d and found this definition on Wikipedia: \u201cIn cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext.\u201d Um\u2026no, encoding produces code, enciphering produces ciphertext, encryption is more than just encoding, and so on. Given the jumbling together of historically very unique and significant terminology I set out to find the actual, historical definitions and try to find a way to teach and/or demonstrate the differences in the foundational forms of cryptography. But I quickly noticed that some of this terminology is so often mis-applied in our digital age that I wondered if maybe there has been an evolution of the meanings of these terms? I might not like it, but I\u2019m open to that possibility. This very quickly led me to the conclusion that my research on this topic would make for an interesting talk and so here we are. I want to share the classical, historical forms of cryptography, discuss the etymology of the terminology, look at how the words apply today \u2013 and help the audience decide if the actual meanings even matter (or it\u2019s just me). One important consideration is the tradeoff between keeping the data secret (security) and protecting the identity of individuals associated with the data (privacy). I hope you\u2019ll join me in this journey to victory (or defeat) in the ongoing battle of preserving the classic goals and objectives of data security.",

0.00s - 6.65s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 First of all, what's the name of this talk?
6.65s - 7.73s |  Anyone?
7.73s - 8.93s |  You have to shout.
18.31s - 21.38s |  How about that?
21.38s - 25.10s |  And an example of something called a Caesar cipher,
25.10s - 27.34s |  a simple substitution cipher.
27.34s - 29.62s |  In our tech industry,
29.62s - 33.98s |  we sometimes call it rot, rotation cipher.
35.38s - 36.50s |  My name is Jeff Mann.
36.58s - 41.02s |  I am a former NSA cryptologist,
41.02s - 45.06s |  consultant advisor, industry old timer.
45.06s - 47.50s |  And feel free to reach out to me anytime
47.50s - 49.26s |  for questions, mentoring.
51.42s - 53.30s |  Take pictures, send them to me.
55.54s - 58.14s |  Spent the early part of my career, as I said, at NSA.
58.14s - 60.40s |  I've been out for almost 30 years now.
62.06s - 65.02s |  20 years ago, I got into doing something called PCI.
66.50s - 69.28s |  Has PCI ever been said from stage at DEF CON before?
69.28s - 70.12s |  I don't know.
74.81s - 76.51s |  Most people in this industry know me
76.51s - 79.15s |  because I was one of the architects,
79.15s - 81.23s |  one of the founders of what came to be known
81.23s - 83.39s |  as the first NSA red team.
83.39s - 86.59s |  So I was doing pen testing back in the early 90s
86.59s - 90.31s |  and did it up until about the mid 90s for NSA.
90.31s - 93.53s |  But I was also a cryptanalyst at NSA,
93.53s - 95.23s |  which is why I'm here talking,
95.23s - 98.03s |  representing the crypto and privacy village, by the way.
100.35s - 104.79s |  I was working as a cryptologist designing systems
104.79s - 106.39s |  back in the late 80s.
106.39s - 107.39s |  One of the things I did,
107.39s - 110.83s |  because computers were becoming a thing,
110.83s - 113.71s |  the digital age was becoming a thing.
113.71s - 116.51s |  I had a client that asked if they could do
116.51s - 120.27s |  a paper manual process on a PC
120.27s - 121.87s |  and was able to produce what I think
121.87s - 125.15s |  was the first software-based NSA produced,
125.15s - 126.87s |  which only did half of it.
126.87s - 130.19s |  The spy in the field was still using the paper,
130.19s - 133.39s |  but the case handler was using a PC
133.39s - 137.61s |  and got the one-time pad key put on floppy disk.
138.91s - 141.31s |  I also had another customer, US Special Forces,
141.31s - 143.43s |  that I designed a cipher wheel for
143.43s - 146.19s |  that would help them with their encryption and decryption
146.19s - 151.56s |  in the field of one-time pads.
151.56s - 155.88s |  But this is just a little bit of cryptographic history
155.88s - 158.64s |  to explain where we came from in cryptography.
158.64s - 161.44s |  You were just hearing a talk talking about encryption
161.44s - 163.24s |  that works in the digital age.
164.60s - 167.56s |  But basically, people have been trying to keep secrets
167.56s - 169.44s |  for thousands of years.
169.44s - 172.64s |  And in the early days, it was primarily keeping secrets
172.64s - 176.56s |  and communicating messages from one end to another,
176.56s - 179.00s |  very often used by the military,
179.00s - 181.24s |  trying to get commands and directions
181.24s - 184.20s |  to troops on the battlefield from the command headquarters
184.20s - 186.40s |  and the generals and things like that.
187.36s - 190.44s |  There's basically, historically,
190.44s - 192.08s |  two different ways of doing that,
192.08s - 194.76s |  two different ways of protecting messages,
194.76s - 196.68s |  and that's called codes and ciphers.
198.28s - 201.36s |  The difference between the two, very briefly,
201.36s - 203.92s |  the way I learned it many years ago,
203.92s - 208.92s |  is code is something you do to words and phrases
209.68s - 212.56s |  or thoughts and ideas to try to shrink it down
212.56s - 215.40s |  to something that's briefer to transmit
215.76s - 218.72s |  and to communicate, whereas a cipher
218.72s - 220.88s |  is something you're doing to scramble
220.88s - 224.48s |  and create what used to be called a cryptogram,
224.48s - 226.60s |  but it's a one character, one letter,
226.60s - 229.64s |  one number relationship.
230.56s - 232.36s |  There's two ways of doing that.
232.36s - 237.36s |  One way is to do the title of this talk, a substitution.
237.52s - 240.52s |  You're replacing the real letters, the real characters
240.52s - 243.08s |  for something obscure and different
243.08s - 245.00s |  in hopes of confusing people,
245.60s - 248.08s |  which seemed to work since a lot and a lot of people,
248.08s - 249.32s |  not a lot of people seem to know
249.32s - 250.80s |  what the name of the talk was.
251.68s - 254.40s |  The other thing you can do is you simply
255.72s - 260.72s |  scramble the letters, same letters,
260.76s - 262.88s |  just put them in a different order in some way
262.88s - 265.40s |  where the intended recipient knows
265.40s - 267.60s |  how to put it back together.
267.60s - 269.72s |  I can give you a real brief example.
271.08s - 274.48s |  This is an example of a transposition.
275.16s - 276.76s |  Anybody know what my shirt says?
280.38s - 284.58s |  Close, too many secrets, too many secrets.
284.58s - 285.42s |  Very good.
288.28s - 293.28s |  In terms of US history, back in the American Revolution,
294.08s - 296.24s |  there was codes and ciphers used
296.24s - 301.24s |  and an example of a code would be one if by land,
301.36s - 305.80s |  two if by sea, big long phrases reduced down
305.80s - 310.28s |  to just a light or two lights in a church bell tower.
311.84s - 316.24s |  There was also codes being used by the armies.
316.24s - 318.32s |  They had entire code books written up
318.32s - 321.56s |  where numbers would represent all sorts of words
321.56s - 326.56s |  and just as an example, there was Agent 711,
326.72s - 330.00s |  which was actually the code for George Washington,
330.00s - 334.90s |  General of the Army.
334.90s - 336.54s |  They also were using ciphers,
336.54s - 338.98s |  but in this particular instance,
338.98s - 342.34s |  they weren't using letters to replace letters.
342.34s - 346.26s |  They were using symbols, but it was still a Caesar cipher.
346.26s - 349.22s |  It was still a simple substitution system
349.22s - 351.54s |  and of course, Caesar cipher, that was actually used
351.54s - 353.82s |  by the Confederate Army in the Civil War.
353.82s - 357.18s |  They had a cipher wheel themselves,
357.18s - 358.62s |  which was part of the inspiration
358.62s - 362.26s |  for the cipher wheel that I designed many years later.
362.86s - 367.86s |  Freemasons, they have loved to use ciphers for many years.
369.46s - 371.58s |  The particular cipher they use,
371.58s - 374.14s |  these are examples of tombstones
374.14s - 376.62s |  of dead members of the Freemasons
376.62s - 378.62s |  and they often would leave messages,
378.62s - 382.26s |  encrypted messages on their tombstones
382.26s - 384.62s |  using something called a pigpen cipher,
384.62s - 387.22s |  where instead of letters, they would write letters
387.22s - 389.86s |  into like tic-tac-toe squares
389.86s - 391.78s |  and instead of the letters,
391.82s - 394.50s |  they would simply use the shape of the box
394.50s - 396.58s |  or the cell that the letter fell in.
396.58s - 401.46s |  This is kind of what it looks like.
401.46s - 403.78s |  If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure,
403.78s - 406.74s |  they have something that they call the Ottendorf cipher,
406.74s - 408.58s |  where there's a whole bunch of numbers
408.58s - 411.18s |  written on the back of the Declaration of Independence
411.18s - 415.02s |  and invisible ink and that translates to,
415.02s - 418.98s |  if you know the right book, the particular page of a book,
418.98s - 421.18s |  the particular line on the page
421.18s - 424.02s |  and the particular letter across the line.
425.42s - 427.02s |  That really kind of existed.
427.02s - 430.70s |  That is something that was done in the revolution.
430.70s - 432.30s |  It was called the Arnold cipher.
434.82s - 437.90s |  Others, examples of transpositions
437.90s - 441.86s |  and this goes back, I think it's to the ancient Egyptians.
441.86s - 444.82s |  They used to have a stick of a certain size
444.82s - 447.06s |  and wrap a leather strap around it,
447.06s - 450.42s |  write their message and then unwind it
450.42s - 452.82s |  and so it was just a bunch of random letters
452.86s - 455.02s |  written out on this big long strip.
455.02s - 456.70s |  They would send it to the recipient.
456.70s - 459.10s |  He would have to have the same size stick
459.10s - 462.74s |  to wrap it back together again and put it back in order.
462.74s - 465.18s |  Also something that was used that I learned about
465.18s - 466.70s |  in my early days was something
466.70s - 468.66s |  that's sort of like a crossword puzzle,
468.66s - 470.82s |  but you have a sort of a stencil,
470.82s - 473.14s |  a square with certain holes cut out of it.
473.14s - 476.38s |  You'd write your message in one letter at a time,
476.38s - 478.58s |  rotate it, keep going with your message,
478.58s - 480.14s |  rotate it and so on and so forth.
480.14s - 483.10s |  When you pull it up, you've got a square
483.10s - 485.22s |  filled with letters in a random order
485.22s - 486.82s |  that hopefully nobody could figure out
486.82s - 488.22s |  how to put it back together.
490.74s - 494.50s |  Another example of something that I learned back in my days
494.50s - 497.26s |  is something called a substitution cipher play fair
497.26s - 499.90s |  where you would put the letters of the alphabet
499.90s - 501.82s |  in a five by five square.
502.70s - 504.70s |  Of course, we had 26 letters in the alphabet
504.70s - 506.46s |  so we had to double up very commonly.
506.46s - 509.02s |  It was JK, but it could have been anything else.
510.14s - 512.14s |  The first ones were just simply A to Z,
512.14s - 515.06s |  but to add a level of complexity,
515.06s - 518.50s |  very often you would start using a keyword.
518.50s - 522.18s |  Did I do that?
522.18s - 528.46s |  Hey, who is this guy?
530.46s - 532.62s |  To add complexity, you'd start with a keyword
532.62s - 535.02s |  and write the letters of that word out in the square
535.02s - 537.26s |  and then you've used a letter once,
537.26s - 539.98s |  you'd fill in the rest of the square with the alphabet.
539.98s - 542.42s |  And then the way that you would do the encryption
542.42s - 546.50s |  and the decryption was basically create a square
547.34s - 548.62s |  with the letter that you wanted to write
548.62s - 553.30s |  and then make a square and find out what the cipher is,
553.30s - 555.50s |  if that makes sense to you by looking at it.
557.78s - 560.46s |  World War II, Navajo,
562.66s - 565.94s |  natives were enlisted to be radio operators
565.94s - 567.78s |  and code talkers.
567.78s - 570.66s |  The Japanese, the enemy never broke the code.
570.66s - 573.34s |  They were not only just speaking in their native tongue,
573.34s - 574.62s |  which apparently the Japanese
575.02s - 576.90s |  had a hard time understanding,
576.90s - 581.90s |  but they were using words to mean other things.
582.06s - 584.50s |  So you can see some examples there,
584.50s - 587.70s |  like a battleship was a whale, things like that.
587.70s - 590.22s |  Seems intuitive now that that would have made sense,
590.22s - 591.42s |  but it worked.
593.22s - 597.10s |  Machine encryption started becoming popular in the 30s
597.10s - 600.02s |  and most famously in World War II,
600.02s - 601.94s |  there was the German Enigma machine.
602.70s - 607.50s |  I went to work for the NSA in 1986,
607.50s - 608.94s |  was learning about things like this
608.94s - 611.34s |  and sort of basic courses that we took
611.34s - 613.90s |  to get introduced to the field,
615.02s - 619.06s |  mostly to try to bide our time while our clearances,
619.06s - 622.02s |  our background investigations were being completed.
622.02s - 625.38s |  I learned at that time in 1986
625.38s - 629.02s |  that we weren't telling people
629.02s - 630.74s |  that the Enigma machine had been broken
630.74s - 631.74s |  back in World War II.
632.54s - 633.38s |  That was still a secret.
633.38s - 636.38s |  It wasn't revealed to the public
636.38s - 640.02s |  that the Enigma machine had been broken in World War II,
641.18s - 645.78s |  prior to World War II until I think 1987 or 88.
645.78s - 649.90s |  The reason being there was still somebody out there
649.90s - 651.06s |  that was using it.
652.58s - 657.58s |  It was first broken in 1938 by Polish cryptographers
657.70s - 661.38s |  and used for 50 years after that.
662.06s - 664.14s |  And we kept a secret that we knew how to break it.
664.14s - 666.30s |  I don't think there's anything else that we've ever done
666.30s - 669.66s |  in terms of secrecy that's held up that long.
671.06s - 674.14s |  We being the US, we being NSA types.
675.46s - 679.26s |  Some of the radios and equipment that were being used
679.26s - 681.82s |  when I was there at NSA back in the 80s and 90s,
681.82s - 683.94s |  a lot of these were Vietnam era,
683.94s - 688.22s |  but again, it was about communication security.
688.22s - 689.46s |  When I first went to work
689.46s - 691.58s |  for the defensive side of operations,
691.58s - 694.42s |  it was called ComSec, communication security.
694.42s - 698.14s |  Shortly after that, it was renamed to information security.
698.14s - 699.82s |  So we called it InfoSec.
702.97s - 704.25s |  But some of these radios,
704.25s - 706.81s |  initially they would take an analog signal
706.81s - 709.97s |  and they would apply an encryption algorithm,
709.97s - 712.25s |  usually built into a little black box
712.25s - 714.41s |  because that's what NSA built in those days
714.41s - 716.61s |  with key being applied to it.
716.61s - 718.61s |  So there was encryption involved
718.61s - 720.53s |  and then a receiver on the other end
721.25s - 723.37s |  that could reverse the process.
723.37s - 726.45s |  Later on, there was radios and devices
726.45s - 729.53s |  that would convert the analog signal to digital
729.53s - 731.93s |  and then do the encryption of the digits,
731.93s - 735.37s |  send it and then do the whole process in reverse.
737.33s - 739.17s |  These are just different examples.
740.65s - 744.41s |  One other way to try to defeat the enemy from,
744.41s - 747.53s |  or adversary from intercepting the signal
747.53s - 749.05s |  was not only encrypting it,
749.05s - 751.53s |  but trying to hide it across frequencies.
751.53s - 752.93s |  So send a little bit here,
752.93s - 755.73s |  then using some sort of random algorithm
755.73s - 757.77s |  that was predictable on both sides,
757.77s - 759.61s |  send more and more of the signal
759.61s - 761.81s |  just on different frequencies.
761.81s - 763.05s |  Interestingly enough,
763.05s - 768.05s |  that concept was invented
768.05s - 772.09s |  by Hedy Lamarr, a movie actress from the 1920s.
773.97s - 775.61s |  That's just a shout out to women.
775.61s - 777.45s |  We need more women in industry
777.49s - 782.06s |  because they're smarter than us men very often.
782.06s - 784.62s |  As the systems advanced,
784.62s - 787.62s |  keys needed to be more complex and longer
787.62s - 790.58s |  and keys needed to be changed frequently.
790.58s - 793.02s |  And when you were putting it into a little black box,
793.02s - 795.54s |  you needed to have key machines
795.54s - 797.54s |  that inject the keys.
797.54s - 801.06s |  So these are some examples of key injectors.
802.86s - 805.86s |  This was something that was trying to be popular.
806.86s - 809.78s |  Again, when I was at NSA in the late 80s,
809.78s - 811.86s |  sort of trying to get modern.
811.86s - 814.38s |  So they had a little thing called a KL-43
814.38s - 816.90s |  that had a keyboard and had a little LCD screen
816.90s - 819.62s |  that I think held, you could see 32 digits.
819.62s - 822.06s |  And the idea was you type in a message
822.06s - 824.98s |  and it would immediately be encrypted on the screen.
824.98s - 827.14s |  Usually it would be output to,
828.26s - 830.94s |  gosh, we didn't have thumb drives back then.
830.94s - 833.02s |  It would either be transmitted automatically
833.10s - 836.02s |  or be printed out on paper for distribution.
836.02s - 839.26s |  But the idea was this was high tech,
839.26s - 842.22s |  self-contained encryption system
842.22s - 843.90s |  rather than a little black box
843.90s - 847.02s |  or a little black inside of a radio or a phone
847.02s - 849.30s |  or a little black box that the radio or phone
849.30s - 850.42s |  was attached to.
853.22s - 856.38s |  Stu-3 telephone was what we were using at the time.
856.38s - 860.22s |  So it was one of the first times that NSA put out
860.22s - 862.42s |  for bid to a contractor
863.26s - 866.94s |  an idea of, you know, NSA came up with the specs,
866.94s - 870.94s |  but different contractors bid on the idea
870.94s - 872.98s |  of how to make a secure phone.
873.94s - 875.50s |  These secure phones were starting
875.50s - 877.38s |  to use public key cryptography
877.38s - 880.62s |  and the keys were seeded with these things
880.62s - 883.18s |  that looked like keys, but you had to stick it in,
883.18s - 886.30s |  turn it, have it, read it and set it up.
886.30s - 889.54s |  And the first ones were half duplex,
889.54s - 891.42s |  which means kind of like a walkie talkie.
891.42s - 894.78s |  It's pushed to talk, one way communication,
894.78s - 897.66s |  then you let go and then the other person would talk back.
897.66s - 901.82s |  On a telephone, that was often very difficult.
901.82s - 903.70s |  And because of the encryption,
904.86s - 906.50s |  when you used it, you kind of sounded,
906.50s - 908.10s |  the people on the other end kind of sounded
908.10s - 913.10s |  like Donald Duck, but it was modern technology at the time.
913.82s - 915.34s |  And eventually they were able to put it
915.34s - 919.54s |  into smartphones, cell phones, so it became more portable.
921.70s - 924.02s |  Very briefly, you know, now we're in the age
924.02s - 926.62s |  of digital cryptography, things have evolved.
928.86s - 931.34s |  We all use cryptography every day
931.34s - 933.42s |  in our lives on the internet.
933.42s - 936.46s |  And there's probably a lot of you guys know this,
936.46s - 939.22s |  but there's basically two forms of encryption.
939.22s - 942.30s |  There's symmetric encryption where it's the same key used
942.30s - 945.22s |  on either end of the communication.
945.22s - 947.78s |  And the communication these days are websites
947.78s - 948.98s |  and so on and so forth.
949.46s - 953.58s |  And then the other type public key cryptography
953.58s - 956.66s |  is the idea of key pairs where it's a one way,
956.66s - 959.02s |  there's a public and a private key.
959.02s - 962.22s |  I hold my private key and give you my public key.
962.22s - 964.54s |  And I give all of you my public key
964.54s - 966.02s |  because you can encrypt a message
966.02s - 969.50s |  that I can only decrypt with my private key.
969.50s - 971.98s |  But for me to talk back to you,
971.98s - 975.66s |  I've got to get your public key and I can write a message
975.66s - 977.78s |  and send it to you and you're the only one
977.78s - 978.82s |  that can decrypt it.
979.66s - 981.74s |  Very simplified view.
981.74s - 984.18s |  There is a third form up in Canada
984.18s - 986.70s |  and it's called symmetric A encryption.
987.78s - 988.62s |  That was a joke.
990.26s - 994.06s |  Whitfield Diffie, he was affiliated with NSA
994.06s - 996.14s |  often on Diffie-Hellman algorithm.
996.14s - 999.10s |  I actually took a course with him early on at NSA.
999.10s - 1002.22s |  That's why I kind of threw his picture up there.
1002.22s - 1003.50s |  And then you got the modern age
1003.50s - 1005.74s |  and all the fun stuff coming like with quantum.
1005.74s - 1008.58s |  I don't wanna say that much about quantum cryptography.
1009.54s - 1011.10s |  The other big thing that's popular,
1011.10s - 1012.42s |  I just saw it earlier in the week.
1012.42s - 1014.54s |  I was down at that other conference
1014.54s - 1016.30s |  that we don't mention around here,
1016.30s - 1018.58s |  but the idea of homomorphic encryption,
1018.58s - 1020.18s |  which really rubs me the wrong way
1020.18s - 1022.06s |  because I spent my entire career
1022.06s - 1023.58s |  and learned about all the different ways
1023.58s - 1026.82s |  that we protect data, protect data, encrypt data,
1026.82s - 1029.74s |  with the idea that we're keeping things a secret.
1029.74s - 1032.18s |  But people are coming up with ways
1032.18s - 1034.50s |  of being able to encrypt data,
1034.50s - 1037.46s |  but still get meaningful information out of it.
1037.46s - 1039.94s |  I don't get my head wrapped around that very well.
1039.94s - 1043.38s |  I kind of think that, okay, it's neat technology.
1043.38s - 1044.78s |  It's a neat idea.
1044.78s - 1046.66s |  Just don't call it encryption,
1046.66s - 1050.14s |  but I'm losing that battle as many other battles.
1051.42s - 1054.50s |  Just in terms of why I kind of put this talk together,
1056.30s - 1057.26s |  several months ago,
1057.26s - 1059.74s |  I do a podcast called Paul's Security Weekly.
1059.74s - 1061.82s |  And gosh, it was probably a year ago.
1061.82s - 1063.50s |  We were talking to somebody
1063.50s - 1066.06s |  and somebody in the chat,
1066.06s - 1067.98s |  when we used to broadcast live,
1067.98s - 1070.50s |  was saying something about encryption and encoding.
1070.50s - 1072.46s |  And I'm like, you know, those are two different things.
1072.46s - 1074.10s |  And he's like, well, no, they're interchangeable.
1074.10s - 1077.90s |  So I like went out to Google the meaning of the words.
1077.90s - 1080.66s |  And I went, I found on Wikipedia,
1080.66s - 1084.82s |  the definition here and I'm reading through it.
1084.82s - 1088.22s |  And I'm gonna have to stick to my laptop here for a minute.
1089.54s - 1091.26s |  It says, well, you can read it,
1091.26s - 1092.86s |  but it uses encryption saying
1092.86s - 1095.10s |  it's the process of encoding.
1095.10s - 1100.10s |  And later on, it talks about cipher text, plain text.
1101.54s - 1104.58s |  But this has always been kind of a beef with me
1104.58s - 1107.06s |  because there's codes and there's ciphers.
1107.06s - 1109.74s |  And encoding is something you do with code.
1109.74s - 1112.18s |  And then ciphering is something you do with ciphers.
1112.18s - 1114.10s |  They're two different things,
1114.10s - 1116.46s |  but they're very often used interchangeably,
1117.30s - 1119.86s |  which bothers me because I'm a purist.
1119.86s - 1122.66s |  Another thing I found was another definition
1122.66s - 1125.18s |  and they talked to, oops, sorry.
1125.18s - 1128.50s |  They talked about secret codes
1128.50s - 1130.78s |  and there's talking about coding and decoding
1130.78s - 1132.86s |  and that's how you get ciphers.
1132.86s - 1134.54s |  That's not technically accurate.
1136.42s - 1138.38s |  If you remember, I shared this earlier.
1140.50s - 1143.90s |  This is sort of the summary of what codes and ciphers are.
1143.90s - 1145.58s |  And I kind of wanted to set out
1145.58s - 1147.74s |  and try to give some information
1147.74s - 1150.62s |  about why I say these words are wrong.
1150.62s - 1153.14s |  And the CFP that I submitted,
1153.14s - 1156.18s |  they gave me feedback that this was sounding subjective
1156.18s - 1158.58s |  and opinion-based, but it's actually not.
1159.62s - 1162.50s |  I have sort of the Bibles of cryptography.
1162.50s - 1164.62s |  They're just declassified at some point.
1164.62s - 1166.22s |  I was allowed to keep my copies
1166.22s - 1170.58s |  of military cryptanalytics volumes one and two
1170.58s - 1173.70s |  or part one and two written by gentlemen
1173.70s - 1176.14s |  that were very highly respected cryptographers
1176.14s - 1178.90s |  before World War II sort of became the pioneers
1178.90s - 1183.90s |  in the formation of NSA, Lambros Kalimahos.
1183.98s - 1186.74s |  And if you guys have gone to the village
1186.74s - 1188.86s |  and you've heard about the Goldbug Award,
1188.86s - 1190.82s |  there's also a society at NSA
1190.82s - 1194.18s |  of cryptographers called the Dundee Society.
1194.18s - 1196.90s |  You can see the explanation of it there.
1196.90s - 1200.18s |  But then also the other author was William Friedman.
1200.18s - 1201.10s |  Thank you.
1201.10s - 1204.86s |  Between he and his wife, Elizabeth Friedman,
1204.86s - 1206.54s |  they were sort of responsible.
1206.54s - 1208.46s |  They're sort of considered the godfather,
1208.46s - 1210.90s |  the godmother of cryptography.
1210.90s - 1212.06s |  So these are the authors.
1212.06s - 1213.82s |  These guys were the ones breaking the codes
1213.82s - 1215.74s |  and ciphers back in World War II.
1216.74s - 1220.48s |  So very quickly, the definitions that they wrote
1220.48s - 1224.02s |  that are written down are such,
1224.02s - 1226.34s |  and hopefully you can see it on the screen there.
1226.34s - 1229.18s |  I just wanna highlight a couple of things here
1229.18s - 1231.74s |  where, again, it's in writing.
1231.74s - 1235.42s |  Ciphers have to do with individual letters.
1235.42s - 1236.98s |  I say characters.
1236.98s - 1242.42s |  And then the codes have to do with words and phrases.
1242.42s - 1244.66s |  Oh, this is something I picked up.
1244.66s - 1247.24s |  I was reading, preparing for this this morning,
1247.24s - 1249.30s |  and I thought this was kind of interesting.
1249.30s - 1251.14s |  I hadn't noticed it before.
1251.14s - 1253.92s |  But there's a statement there that simply says
1253.92s - 1255.90s |  you do these things, you encrypt things
1255.90s - 1259.42s |  and create cryptograms for one of two reasons,
1259.42s - 1262.70s |  secrecy and economy or brevity.
1262.70s - 1263.90s |  And I thought that was interesting
1263.90s - 1266.54s |  because the way I was learning code and cipher,
1266.54s - 1269.30s |  especially when we're starting to get into computers
1269.30s - 1272.14s |  and internet technology,
1272.14s - 1275.90s |  encoding was always considered a way to shrink down,
1275.90s - 1278.50s |  compress the data so it could be sent quicker
1278.50s - 1279.98s |  and more easily.
1279.98s - 1283.22s |  And we never presumed that it was secure.
1283.22s - 1285.86s |  That's what the encryption was for.
1285.86s - 1289.78s |  So brevity or speed, coding,
1290.78s - 1294.62s |  secrecy, protection of what you're trying to transmit,
1294.62s - 1295.46s |  cipher.
1297.66s - 1301.14s |  And then finally, just a brief mention here again,
1301.14s - 1303.98s |  where they talk about the introduction of key.
1303.98s - 1307.54s |  And we know key now most commonly as certificates,
1307.54s - 1310.94s |  but key was really any method that was used
1310.94s - 1313.10s |  and agreed upon by both sides
1314.46s - 1318.54s |  as how you were gonna do the encryption, the protection.
1318.58s - 1322.02s |  Nowadays, it's mostly just throwing huge random streams
1322.02s - 1324.06s |  that hopefully nobody can figure out
1324.06s - 1326.18s |  and giving the random streams to both ends
1326.18s - 1329.38s |  to go through a very complex mathematical algorithm.
1329.38s - 1331.18s |  That's where we are today.
1331.18s - 1333.82s |  But just to summarize in terms of
1333.82s - 1335.54s |  why I think words have meanings
1335.54s - 1337.22s |  and why I think we need to understand
1337.22s - 1338.34s |  the meanings of the words,
1338.34s - 1341.38s |  even in our modern digital context
1341.38s - 1343.10s |  is going back to the fundamentals
1343.10s - 1345.94s |  of where they came from, codes and ciphers.
1345.94s - 1348.18s |  And I would suggest to you that again,
1348.82s - 1350.70s |  if you think about codes or encoding
1350.70s - 1354.62s |  as just a way to compress and increase speed,
1354.62s - 1356.94s |  not necessarily security,
1356.94s - 1358.86s |  that's where the cipher and the encryption
1358.86s - 1361.06s |  and the big long key streams come in.
1364.47s - 1368.43s |  Real briefly, it's all about protection of data,
1368.43s - 1370.11s |  information, keeping secrets.
1370.11s - 1371.55s |  You probably know about the idea
1371.55s - 1374.39s |  of confidential integrity and availability
1374.39s - 1379.31s |  and then digital age introduced things like non repudiation.
1379.35s - 1382.35s |  We spent most of our time in the digital age
1382.35s - 1384.67s |  focusing on the confidentiality.
1384.67s - 1386.11s |  Nowadays, we're trying to figure out
1386.11s - 1387.83s |  how to do the availability
1387.83s - 1391.35s |  because of all the ransomware attacks that are out there.
1391.35s - 1393.83s |  One last thing that cipher wheel I mentioned,
1394.71s - 1398.03s |  it was put on display at the National Cryptologic Museum
1398.03s - 1400.87s |  near Fort Meade, Maryland back in April.
1400.87s - 1404.19s |  And it's on display through September.
1404.19s - 1407.47s |  If you make it to Maryland, it's in a display case.
1407.47s - 1411.19s |  There I am looking at it and there's the display.
1411.19s - 1413.47s |  If you could probably not read it there,
1413.47s - 1416.31s |  but it says Jeff Mann reinvents the wheel.
1417.35s - 1418.55s |  So thank you very much.
