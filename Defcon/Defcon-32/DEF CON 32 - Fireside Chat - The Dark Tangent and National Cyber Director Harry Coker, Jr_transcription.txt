  "description": "The world increasingly appreciates how much we rely on space systems for our personal, economic, and national security needs. However, the nation-state cyber threat to government and commercial systems continues to grow at a time when the current landscape of cybersecurity policies and frameworks aren\u2019t readily applicable for space systems.\n\nIn this fireside chat, ONCD will have the opportunity to introduce our 2nd National Cyber Director to the research community and discuss some of his priorities, such as space cybersecurity. We will discuss how the White House has been working to tackle hard problems and challenges. In the instance of space cybersecurity, ONCD has been collaborating with federal space operators and the space industry to develop policy solutions, including by answering a tasking from the Vice President to develop minimum cybersecurity requirements for U.S. space systems.",

0.00s - 7.04s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 great to see everyone. Um, DEF CON noobs, keep drinking water, take care of yourself. Um, I'm
7.04s - 13.42s |  Jason Healy. I was asked to moderate this far side chat with the director of your United
13.42s - 18.32s |  States, um, Office of the National Cyber Director. So today we have, um, Director Harry
18.32s - 22.52s |  Coker, who we're going to be having a far side chat with. My name is Jason Healy. I get
22.52s - 27.96s |  asked to do this. Um, I've been on the DEF CON review board for about ten years. So we're
27.96s - 32.06s |  CFP and review all of the talks that come through. I've also been at the White House twice,
32.06s - 38.80s |  2003, 2005, and also to help set up the, um, the Office of the National Cyber Director. Um,
38.80s - 43.64s |  so Harry's gonna come out. He's got some, um, uh, some initial remarks and then we'll just
43.64s - 47.88s |  dive right into the comments. So, um, he's got an amazing bio we're not gonna cover, but
47.88s - 51.62s |  to, please do be checking it out. Um, and with that, Harry.
59.72s - 79.62s |  Thanks, Jerry. First things first, as I tell all the bartenders I work with, pour it like
79.62s - 85.22s |  you don't own it. So that's what I did. But that actually came from, uh, the military
85.22s - 93.14s |  cyber, uh, professional association. So that is cyber bourbon. Um, I have somewhere around
93.14s - 101.18s |  70. Uh, bought a barrel, but on to why we're here. Sorry. Uh, thanks, Jay. Um, it's a pleasure
101.18s - 106.50s |  to be here and actually it's my first time at DEF CON as you, um, you've noticed. Uh,
106.50s - 111.50s |  but as a scotch drinker myself, I'm a bit disappointed that all of my speeches don't
111.50s - 116.26s |  start this way. Um, but perhaps this will be another tradition that we, uh, bring forth
116.26s - 122.30s |  at, uh, ONCD. All right. Looking forward to our conversation, Jay, uh, where we'll dig
122.34s - 128.70s |  into memory safety, uh, BGP security, firmware, vulnerability, and open source software. All
128.70s - 135.14s |  of the nuanced and technical topics that make Hacker Summer Camp such a draw, even in this
135.14s - 140.54s |  new venue. Uh, but before we get into the hard problems that really define our work
140.54s - 144.30s |  at the, uh, White House Office of National Cyber Director, I want to say a few words
144.30s - 150.54s |  about the importance of this community to our effort to make our nation safer, um, more
151.18s - 157.62s |  innovative, and prosperous. Uh, this is my first DEF CON. Again, as you noticed, uh, by my
157.62s - 163.70s |  baptism, uh, by this bourbon. And actually it shouldn't be a tradition just for first timers.
163.70s - 168.54s |  Um, but while I have been thoroughly impressed by the people, the presentations, and
168.54s - 173.50s |  actually, uh, some policy proposals that I've seen over the past couple of days, uh, I
173.50s - 179.30s |  cannot say that I'm surprised. Uh, from my early exposure to coding as a computer science
179.30s - 186.10s |  graduate student, um, to my time collaborating with reverse engineers, uh, and colleagues
186.10s - 191.54s |  in the intelligence community, to arriving at the White House, I've known how special, uh,
191.54s - 198.46s |  the security research community is. Special, but often misunderstood. Uh, as a society, we
198.46s - 204.74s |  are predisposed to celebrate builders, uh, inventors, engineers, the titans of industries.
204.74s - 210.90s |  All are lauded for what they've designed and constructed. So it can be quite jarring to hear
210.90s - 217.98s |  about a culture where tinkering is turned to, to brick, turn toward breaking things, albeit to
217.98s - 224.58s |  make them stronger. Where rather than synthesis and cohesion, we talk about decompiling code
224.58s - 230.46s |  to find its weaknesses. Where manipulating people in the form of social engineering is
230.50s - 235.86s |  venerated as a way of finding the weak points in a system. And if there's one place in the
235.86s - 242.34s |  world where these concepts are particularly foreign, it's Washington, D.C. Our elected
242.34s - 248.34s |  officials and our civil servants swear an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, and
248.34s - 255.18s |  it is far from intuitive, uh, to how hacking could possibly be in that interest. I can see
255.18s - 260.90s |  where they're coming from, uh, but my personal experiences urge me to challenge them to think a
260.90s - 267.82s |  bit deeper. Uh, to understand that for folks in this community, the desire to make things, to
267.82s - 273.26s |  take things apart, is rooted in a hope that they will be made stronger. Uh, to recognize that the
273.26s - 280.26s |  internet, decentralized, governed largely by a simple set of rules written decades ago, is a
280.26s - 287.66s |  miracle of human ingenuity. And that miraculous, as it may be, the internet also needs
287.66s - 293.90s |  protecting. That ethos of trying to make the internet a safer place is what makes this
293.90s - 299.42s |  community so important and vital to our way of life. It's why it's so important for me to have
299.42s - 305.14s |  made this pilgrimage out to the desert, along with so many of our cyber colleagues. And I've got
305.14s - 311.34s |  good news for you. My voice is not alone in Washington. The chorus is growing. Jay, I know
311.34s - 316.70s |  that when you were actually serving on the National Security Council staff decades ago, uh, you
316.70s - 323.58s |  weren't even allowed to come to DEF CON. Today, not only are the feds here in force to learn and
323.58s - 330.52s |  to celebrate the work of this community, we are recruiting. One of the key projects that we
330.52s - 335.16s |  launched at the Office of the National Cyber Director, uh, was a white paper focused on memory
335.16s - 342.28s |  safety titled, Back to the Building Blocks. I will admit to being a, a bit surprised to see such a
342.28s - 347.32s |  technical product come out of the White House. Yet after reviewing the report and learning about
347.32s - 353.96s |  the research and consultation underlying it, I was completely convinced that it was vital that the
353.96s - 358.56s |  White House shine a spotlight on the need to adopt solutions on the most critical
358.56s - 365.54s |  vulnerabilities. The White House endorsing formal mess methods is now a bit of a meme, and I could
365.54s - 372.00s |  not be happier. These are outward signs of progress. At least as important, though, is a
372.00s - 377.84s |  cultural change happening in Washington. For the first time, we are seeing policymakers consider
377.84s - 383.36s |  how to leverage unique aspects of the security research community to solve some of the very
383.36s - 390.36s |  hardest problems in cyber security. Some of that is manifesting at the operational level as
390.36s - 397.96s |  collaboration, not simply information sharing. And that has been increasingly the norm at NSA's
397.96s - 404.80s |  Cyber Security Collaboration Center and CISA's Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative. And it does
404.80s - 411.94s |  extend to more strategic proposals, too. Just yesterday, ONCD and our partners in the
411.94s - 418.22s |  government's Open Source Software Security Initiative released a report summarizing key
418.22s - 424.38s |  findings from a request for information that we announced right here at last year's DEF CON.
424.38s - 430.74s |  Importantly, that summary also describes actions that we are taking in response to the feedback from
430.74s - 438.30s |  this community. Some of those actions are inherently governmental. For instance, we are proud to
438.30s - 444.82s |  announce that the Department of Homeland Security has committed $11 million from the bipartisan
444.82s - 451.42s |  infrastructure law to launch the Open Source Software Prevalence Initiative. Along with partners
451.42s - 456.70s |  at our national labs, the initiative will assess the prevalence of open source software in
456.70s - 462.58s |  operational technology used by critical infrastructure owners and operators. We know that
462.58s - 468.58s |  open source underlies our digital infrastructure, and it's vital that, as a government, we
468.58s - 475.22s |  contribute back to the community as part of our broader infrastructure efforts. But many more of the
475.22s - 481.38s |  recommendations go beyond what the government can do alone. And that's where you all come in.
481.38s - 487.30s |  These policy proposals rely on the dedication of security researchers and their willingness to
487.30s - 492.94s |  freely share their findings in order to work. In our conversations, we are developing a software
492.94s - 500.14s |  liability regime, too. We are increasingly aiming to leverage this unique community as part of
500.14s - 507.70s |  novel policy solutions. Our reliance on all of you does, however, come with a commensurate increase
507.70s - 514.02s |  in responsibility. In the President's National Cybersecurity Strategy, we call for more of the
514.02s - 521.14s |  responsibility for defending cyberspace to fall upon the more capable actors in the ecosystem.
521.14s - 527.34s |  That means technology producers, yes, and certainly the federal government, but it also means all of
527.34s - 535.10s |  you. I know that you all are up to it. And I know that the same value set that drives responsible
535.10s - 541.94s |  vulnerability disclosure will lead you to continue to step up for the protection of the Internet. I
541.94s - 547.94s |  know the Internet is a safer place today because of all of your efforts. But I hope you can
547.94s - 555.94s |  appreciate the magnitude and impact of the hard problems defending cyberspace. They may seem easy to
555.94s - 561.98s |  some of you, but the President can't simply issue an order and solve those problems. We've known
561.98s - 568.18s |  about vulnerabilities in the Border Gateway Protocol for decades. Still, much of the U.S.
568.18s - 573.90s |  Internet traffic is subject to hijacking. Memory-safe programming languages have similarly been
573.90s - 581.82s |  around for years. Still, critical software that underlies our society is written in C simply
581.82s - 588.14s |  because that's what's convenient. The tragedy of the commons around open-source software
588.14s - 595.22s |  development is a well-understood phenomenon. Still, vital packages are maintained by tiny bands of
595.22s - 603.46s |  volunteers operating on a less-than-shoestring budget. Policy can address some of these problems.
603.46s - 609.94s |  Now, I'll even go further. Policy is essential to addressing these problems, but policy does
609.94s - 615.30s |  require time. The people of the United States have entrusted their government with awesome
615.30s - 621.26s |  responsibilities. And as we work to use them to improve our cybersecurity posture, we must ensure
621.26s - 627.18s |  that we do so responsibly, with an eye towards outcomes that preserve the innovation and
627.18s - 632.94s |  decentralization that have made the Internet the miracle that it is today. Most important,
632.94s - 638.14s |  though, is that we continue to work together. At the core of our approach at the Office of the
638.14s - 644.22s |  National Cyber Director is partnership. We prioritize hearing and learning from a diverse
644.22s - 649.74s |  array of stakeholders, and you all are key constituents of ours. I know that Jay and I will
649.74s - 655.86s |  dig into some of the details on various initiatives, but we will also continue to seek your
655.86s - 661.10s |  feedback throughout the rest of this weekend and beyond. So thank you again for everything you're
661.10s - 668.26s |  doing every day to passionately protect our digital ecosystem. And thank you again for welcoming me to
668.26s - 668.86s |  DEF CON.
677.71s - 685.79s |  Okay, so to start with, Harry, be really careful about this table, because the previous speakers
685.79s - 690.99s |  are messy and there is booze all over this table, and if we touch it, we're going to stick to it. So
690.99s - 694.99s |  I would just be careful about that. Second, remember all those questions that we said we were
694.99s - 700.59s |  going to talk about? I'm not going to start with those. Yeah, so the ONCD staff here is starting to
700.59s - 708.59s |  panic a little bit. Because you said such, you know, a word that we don't use here at DEF CON
708.59s - 714.99s |  often enough, the Internet is a freaking miracle. And I mean that in two ways, and I'm going to ask
714.99s - 720.91s |  you to expand, but let me go into it. Because miracles are two things. One, the Internet is
720.91s - 729.31s |  probably the most transformative technology since Gutenberg. Since we came up with movable type, the
729.31s - 734.91s |  Internet and the things around it have probably transformed us as a species more than anything
734.91s - 741.35s |  else. And just imagine if the Pope, the petty princes of Europe could have known what was being
741.35s - 744.85s |  printed, who was printing it and to whom it was being passed. We wouldn't have had the
744.85s - 750.31s |  renaissance. The Internet is this real miracle that we often take advantage of. And it's a
750.31s - 756.81s |  miracle in another sense too. A lot of times a miracle is just something that is really, really,
756.81s - 764.71s |  really, really hard and still comes to be. And when I see this community, I think a lot of my
764.71s - 770.51s |  colleagues in academia and others just take for granted that the Internet is stable at large
770.51s - 778.51s |  scale. Like, oh, it just works. And I'm like, no, doofus. People are working weekends and
778.51s - 784.51s |  they're missing kids' birthdays and they're missing every holiday for years to keep it running.
784.51s - 791.47s |  You know Apollo 13, yay, nerds, right? It's one of our favorite movies, right? And what did
791.47s - 797.87s |  those NASA engineers have to do to get Apollo 13 running, right? They took all of their stuff and
797.87s - 803.91s |  they had to completely nerd how can we make this work. Y'all are Apollo 13ing every week to
803.91s - 808.91s |  keep the Internet up and it just gets taken for granted and a lot of times it ticks me off. So I
808.91s - 812.33s |  just wanted to say thank you very much for acknowledging and using that word that we don't
812.33s - 820.33s |  enough. Thank you for mentioning that. It's unfortunate that miracles like that are taken for
821.33s - 827.33s |  granted. I think if we take the time to reflect on the impact of our daily lives that the digital
830.99s - 837.71s |  foundation has, it won't be taken for granted. But we have become accustomed to a certain way of
837.71s - 843.49s |  life and we expect things to always be there without looking behind the curtain and seeing those
843.53s - 849.53s |  folks working. So let's dive in. We're wearing some bling here. So I got one because I asked and I
858.41s - 864.53s |  used to work in the office. Can you talk about the badge you have on top here? And how can people
864.53s - 869.45s |  get them? The badge is the Office of National Cyber Director. Hopefully you all got them last
869.49s - 876.29s |  year. And hopefully you'll get them this year. You ought to take a look at the open source
876.29s - 882.57s |  software security report that we issued yesterday. There are some clues there. Read it
882.57s - 889.91s |  carefully. That's the first clue I'm giving you. You can also take a look at our GitHub account to
889.91s - 895.79s |  get additional clues. But they are here and available. And again, I'm just going to call some
895.79s - 900.41s |  things out here. When I was at White House, I started in 2003. I had already been coming at
900.41s - 907.07s |  that point to Black Hat for DEF CON for a couple of years. And they wouldn't let me. And now
907.07s - 913.75s |  there's a White House GitHub page. White House is doing official badges. How many folks do you
913.75s - 919.75s |  have here? At least ten folks. That are all over. And when you do something like this in the
919.75s - 929.25s |  White House, this starts to become a presidential record. You can't imagine. I talked briefly
929.25s - 935.47s |  about the culture change that's ongoing in Washington. And it's required. The things that are
935.47s - 942.67s |  happening around the world require us to evolve with them. There are revolutions. But I think
942.67s - 947.41s |  human nature is only that we can evolve. But we have to try to keep pace. Culture change takes a
947.41s - 954.49s |  while. The White House and other government institutions recognize that we need to be able to
954.49s - 960.13s |  relate more broadly. And that's part of the culture change. We need to be able to trust more
960.13s - 966.85s |  broadly. That's part of the culture change. We need to be able to look at the community research
966.85s - 974.21s |  effort and bring that in. To recognize that it's part of our team. It's always been a part of our
974.21s - 977.57s |  team. But we have not always recognized it. That's part of that culture change.
977.57s - 983.45s |  And I love it because it's so much deeper relationship now. On this stage, in this chair, Jen
983.45s - 987.09s |  Easterly yesterday, I don't know how many saw Director Easterly. She was great. But she talked
987.09s - 993.97s |  about when she was more junior and she was helping prepare Keith Alexander for when he was coming to
993.97s - 999.85s |  Black Hat. And I know one of the leading hackers had brought eggs with him and was going to throw
999.89s - 1004.37s |  eggs and ended up not. Because this was right after Snowden. Because it was a very fragile
1004.37s - 1009.61s |  relationship then between the federal government and hackers. And now again, I remember one time I
1009.61s - 1014.73s |  was in your office. I was in the White House compound. And I turned a corner and there were all
1014.73s - 1020.61s |  these blue hairs. You had all of these hackers who were in their full blue haired regalia with
1020.61s - 1025.53s |  their tattoos and their stickers. And they were just there to review the National Cyber Security
1025.53s - 1026.53s |  Strategy and give their input.
1026.85s - 1032.73s |  Yeah. And that's actually a part of a broader culture change. So excuse me for going off script.
1033.77s - 1040.45s |  We need to get past how people look and how they act. If they're committed to getting things done.
1045.57s - 1050.37s |  If they're committed to getting things done for the good of this nation, they ought to be on the
1050.37s - 1059.25s |  team. And personally, I was challenged when a person I hold dearly came home with a Band-Aid over
1059.25s - 1065.49s |  the eye. And I'm like, oh, what happened? And I bumped my head at school. I'm like, okay. Then I
1065.49s - 1072.85s |  saw the prom picture. So there was an earring there. But I had to get over that. That was my
1072.85s - 1077.65s |  issue. Not my loved one's issue. And that's just a personal anecdote.
1077.97s - 1079.93s |  And it wasn't me, by the way, just to be clear.
1080.21s - 1085.41s |  On getting past how people look, where they're from, how they talk. If we're committed to
1085.41s - 1088.97s |  accomplishing the same outcomes, let's move out together.
1089.17s - 1092.81s |  So let's actually get to one of the questions that I said I was going to ask.
1092.81s - 1093.53s |  If you insist.
1093.57s - 1102.97s |  Because we've had, you know, hackers in general, we hate these bullshit requirements. We hate
1102.97s - 1108.29s |  these things that are put in the way. Because that's what the community is about, is saying,
1108.29s - 1113.01s |  wait a minute, that's security theater. This is bullshit. Let's bypass these. And one of those
1113.01s - 1117.97s |  that's held this community back, like, so much of what we have to do is positive action. But
1117.97s - 1123.49s |  sometimes what we have to do is just remove the bullshit. And often we would have these
1123.53s - 1129.33s |  educational and other requirements for jobs that, and this is tough for me to say as a
1129.33s - 1137.41s |  university professor, is we would have these requirements for degrees that just weren't
1137.41s - 1140.05s |  necessary. And I think we've made a lot of progress, right?
1140.25s - 1149.05s |  We have. But first off on the bullshit, throw a flag. If you see something that's not right,
1149.69s - 1157.85s |  throw a flag. We have thick skin at ONCD. We know that no entity gets it right the first time,
1157.85s - 1166.73s |  every time. So we want constructive feedback nonstop. So bring that on. We want to do that.
1167.89s - 1171.69s |  Skills based hiring. It looks like we've been filling out a lot of requirements.
1171.77s - 1180.65s |  Yeah. And I share your challenge on the four year degree requirement. One of the tangible
1180.89s - 1187.33s |  outcomes that our office has been able to accomplish with our partners, and you'll hear me
1187.33s - 1193.49s |  talk about with our partners a lot. Our office is about collaboration, leadership via
1193.49s - 1201.89s |  collaboration. We stood up to bring coherence to the federal cybersecurity ecosystem, not to be
1201.89s - 1207.73s |  in charge, but to lead. And you don't need to be in charge to lead. So we are leading via
1207.73s - 1215.13s |  collaboration. And one area with our partners is a skills based hiring approach. And we
1215.13s - 1222.97s |  recognized that it had been emerging in the private sector and other functional areas. And
1223.01s - 1231.69s |  given that there are roughly 500,000 open cyber jobs in this great nation, and that does not
1231.69s - 1240.81s |  imply we're 500,000 people short in talent. We have the talent. It's not a talent issue. It's a
1240.81s - 1248.01s |  recruiting issue. So we developed a national cyber workforce and education strategy to help
1248.33s - 1262.25s |  address that $500,000 gap in open cyber positions. And one of the focuses is removing barriers to
1262.25s - 1270.61s |  these good paying, purposeful cyber jobs. One of the barriers that we had seen is requirements for
1270.61s - 1277.93s |  four year degrees. And I'd imagine that just about everybody in here knows folks that don't have
1277.93s - 1285.69s |  four year degrees that are making substantial contributions to cybersecurity. Initially, when
1285.69s - 1292.41s |  our team took that on, we thought that needed to change a law or needed to change a regulation.
1292.97s - 1299.25s |  That's not the case. It was just a legacy bad practice. So the first step that our team has
1299.25s - 1306.93s |  taken on in concert with the Office of Management and Budget, OMB and others, is to reach out to the
1306.93s - 1313.25s |  departments and agencies, senior acquisition executives, to ensure that they know that they are
1313.25s - 1321.85s |  not being held to account by the federal government on this four year college degree. If there is a
1321.85s - 1327.13s |  requirement, it's a specific department and agency requirement, and it should not be there. Again,
1327.13s - 1333.57s |  it's a legacy bad practice. So we're getting that word out on the federal contractor side. On the
1334.05s - 1339.37s |  federal employee government civil servant side, we're working with our partners at the Office of
1339.37s - 1347.37s |  Personnel Management, OPM, to do the same thing, to go towards skills based hiring. Why? Because
1347.37s - 1352.25s |  it's not about the paper certification that we all frame and put up on our wall. It's about the
1352.25s - 1359.05s |  knowledge that we have. It's about the skill set that we can apply to the mission set. And, you know, the
1359.05s - 1365.53s |  example that's most near and dear to me, I spent several years at the National Security Agency,
1365.77s - 1374.09s |  working shoulder to shoulder with our colleagues at the US Cyber Command. And many, many of the
1374.17s - 1381.93s |  operators at NSA and Cyber Command are military members. And many of those military members do not
1381.93s - 1388.41s |  have four year college degrees. But they all have the skill set necessary to make significant
1388.41s - 1394.37s |  contributions to our nation's security in cyberspace. So we're working with OPM. They've taken on the
1394.37s - 1403.85s |  task to be completed by June 2025, to transition the largest IT occupation in the federal
1403.85s - 1410.65s |  government, the 2210 series to a skills based approach. And that's just the right thing to do.
1411.25s - 1416.01s |  That's going to remove some barriers, that's going to close that gap. And it's going to make us safer.
1420.01s - 1428.25s |  So especially for folks that don't necessarily know how DC works, right? I'll start with that would
1428.25s - 1435.13s |  include me. Right, when Harry talked about workforce, right, the very first workforce
1435.13s - 1442.73s |  recommendations came from the White House in 2000. So President Clinton's administration had come out
1442.73s - 1448.53s |  with the first, it wasn't quite a strategy, but it was, it was an implementation. And they said,
1448.53s - 1455.97s |  boy, we've got to solve this. Right. So it goes back to 2000. And it's not like DC was, the US
1455.97s - 1461.41s |  government wasn't trying to do this. It's just that there are hard problems that needed longer
1461.41s - 1465.65s |  than you could do in one administration and more than you could do. Because normally in the White
1465.65s - 1471.49s |  House, like when I was there, we had maybe four or six people that were looking at cyberspace,
1471.49s - 1476.49s |  especially on the defensive side. Right, even now out of the National Security Council, there may be
1476.49s - 1484.29s |  six or eight that are doing defense. And your team now is 85-ish, right? So now the National
1484.29s - 1488.61s |  Cyber, the Office of the National Cyber Director can say, we're going to have a special team of a
1488.61s - 1492.65s |  couple people led by an Assistant National Cyber Director to do workforce. And they're going to
1492.65s - 1499.49s |  stay on the problem year after year and make sure we actually make a difference to stay with it. And
1499.49s - 1506.25s |  because that's at the White House, oh, and some of her actually hired in as career civil servants
1506.25s - 1512.81s |  as part of the White House, those jobs are on USA Jobs, go look for them, that they will be able to
1512.81s - 1517.01s |  be there in between administrations. Because, because the director talked about hard problems.
1517.01s - 1522.25s |  Now in your, so Workforce is One, you brought, you really featured open source and you just had
1522.25s - 1528.53s |  this report came out this week, right? Yes, yesterday. Wow. Great. Yep. You let in with hard
1528.61s - 1534.49s |  problems. And that's one of the things that the Office of National Cyber Director is known for,
1534.49s - 1541.89s |  addressing the hard problems. And what's a hard problem? You mentioned workforce challenges were
1541.89s - 1546.45s |  brought to the forefront during the administration of President Clinton, a couple decades ago,
1546.45s - 1551.97s |  something like that. Years and years, problems lingering that have not been sufficiently
1551.97s - 1557.85s |  addressed. Those are hard problems. That's what we like to take on. The easy stuff we leave to
1557.85s - 1562.37s |  other entities, and that's fine. They're valued. But it's the hard problems that we take on.
1562.37s - 1569.01s |  Several of those hard problems, yes, include open source software. How do we address the
1569.01s - 1576.81s |  vulnerabilities? How do we value the folks that are keeping open source software as safe as they
1576.81s - 1584.81s |  have done? The report talks to how some of our open source folks feel. I think the quote was
1585.29s - 1594.37s |  unpaid hobbyists. Unpaid hobbyists. And that's accurate in many senses. But it's not accurate
1594.37s - 1604.37s |  when you couple unpaid with the impact that they have. We need to take a look at how to show how
1604.37s - 1609.53s |  much we value those folks. We value them, but we don't show it the way we should. So we need to
1609.53s - 1616.49s |  take advantage of that. I know earlier today we talked about the German tech fund that's in the
1616.49s - 1624.17s |  report. That's an investment made by the German government on some of their software. And some
1624.17s - 1631.49s |  of the recommendations into the RFI were for the U.S. federal government to make some
1631.49s - 1640.73s |  investments in the open source software. You mentioned the RFI. So one of the ways the U.S.
1640.73s - 1645.13s |  government works is by putting out, hey, we're thinking about making a new rule or we're
1645.13s - 1652.09s |  looking for new information. So ONCD has done two or three at least. So they did one on, hey,
1652.09s - 1658.05s |  what are your ideas in regulatory harmonization? That got maybe 85-ish responses. What are your
1658.05s - 1661.85s |  ideas on open source? So this came out, I think the responses were due in November.
1661.85s - 1665.53s |  On open source, we actually announced that here last year.
1665.53s - 1665.89s |  Oh, great.
1665.89s - 1673.53s |  Yeah. And actually, that's why we came back to announce it. It's great to take all these actions.
1673.53s - 1680.57s |  It's great to have RFIs to get input from the people who, frankly, may know more about these
1680.57s - 1686.85s |  items than we do. But it's not great if we don't take it on board and follow up with action. So we
1686.85s - 1692.77s |  have the summary reports and there will be a public and private sector working group that
1692.77s - 1699.05s |  stands up later this year to take on those recommendations on how to better protect open
1699.05s - 1703.21s |  source software and demonstrate how much we value that.
1703.21s - 1708.69s |  Yeah, great. Just a quick question. How many folks here have ever responded to one of these RFIs or
1708.69s - 1715.17s |  the like? So we've got a handful, but that's not a lot. So when you hear, if you say, man, the
1715.21s - 1721.61s |  stuff that Washington, D.C. is bullshit, they always get it wrong. Look for those RFIs, right?
1721.61s - 1728.37s |  Because that's the government. That's the White House going out and saying, what are we doing
1728.37s - 1736.05s |  wrong? What can we do better? What are your ideas? And you can just submit, right? You don't have to
1736.05s - 1742.09s |  be this tall to enter. You can submit your ideas directly on how we should be improving open
1742.13s - 1747.85s |  source or regulatory harmonization or whatever the next one is going to be. Because now ONCD has
1747.85s - 1752.85s |  made this a repeatable process. And I don't think NSC ever did this or OMB. I think this is very
1752.85s - 1754.69s |  much an ONCD thing, right?
1754.69s - 1760.61s |  Other agencies are doing it now and we are happy that they're doing it now. Again, the key is to
1760.61s - 1768.73s |  make it meaningful. And I'll just speak frankly. I have heard, we have heard from our partners in
1768.73s - 1774.97s |  the private sector that if we don't act upon the feedback, then the opportunity to contribute to
1774.97s - 1781.45s |  an RFI is not going to be nearly as meaningful. And to that end, Jay mentioned the RFI on
1781.61s - 1789.53s |  regulatory harmonization. And we had a lot of feedback, a lot of valuable feedback. And it came
1789.77s - 1797.81s |  in large part from 11 of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors. And that's great. But my
1797.81s - 1804.65s |  concern is the other five critical infrastructure sectors did not submit input to that RFI.
1805.77s - 1809.85s |  Just think about like critical infrastructure sectors, which are kind of by definition,
1809.85s - 1815.37s |  critical to this country, did not submit on their thoughts.
1815.37s - 1818.49s |  Yeah. And that's unfortunate. We're still reaching out to them.
1818.69s - 1820.33s |  Judge, judge, judge.
1820.33s - 1824.89s |  Yeah, we're still reaching out to them because we value their input. Maybe there's another means
1824.89s - 1831.21s |  that's more convenient for them. So we're not giving up on them. But they passed on that
1831.21s - 1832.85s |  opportunity, but we'll get with it.
1833.53s - 1838.09s |  So one of the ways that you can connect, one of the ways you can make policy better, hopefully we
1838.09s - 1843.37s |  might have time to talk about some other ones. But be on the lookout for those RFIs. Even if your
1843.37s - 1848.61s |  company is not going to let you submit, you can still submit just as an individual or grab a bunch
1848.61s - 1853.89s |  of friends. Okay, other hard problems. Where else are we working? I heard you talk about routing,
1853.89s - 1858.73s |  which we hardly ever talk about. So it was glad to hear you bring it up.
1858.81s - 1866.21s |  Yes, our team is working again with our partners in the federal government to include CISA, NIST,
1866.37s - 1873.77s |  the NSA, and plenty of others on securing the internet. As you all know, internet was created
1873.77s - 1881.53s |  decades ago, not envisioned to be what it is today, critical to the way each and every one of us and
1881.53s - 1887.21s |  our loved ones live. It was not envisioned to be that, but that's where we are right now. It was
1887.21s - 1895.93s |  not built to be as secure and safe and reliable as we need it to be. And as a former program
1895.93s - 1903.09s |  manager, I know how difficult it is to bolt these things on after the product has already been
1903.09s - 1908.17s |  built. Nevertheless, that's not enough reason to not take it on. So our team, again, working with
1908.17s - 1914.85s |  our federal partners, is looking at border gateway protocol, the means of transferring bulk
1914.85s - 1924.73s |  internet data, and how to secure that. What we are working on is a recommendation for RPKI as a
1924.77s - 1932.73s |  solution to that. And we realize that RPKI is not going to solve all of the problems on that border
1932.73s - 1941.25s |  gateway protocol. But we also realize need to start somewhere, sometime. And RPKI is a great place to
1941.25s - 1950.37s |  start. And we're still seeking input on how to address those challenges in BGP. And that's one of
1950.37s - 1957.97s |  the reasons we're here to seek you all's input on BGP. And again, another hard problem. It's been
1957.97s - 1964.93s |  around for years and years and years. We have known that the internet is not secure. But we
1964.93s - 1972.01s |  twiddled our thumbs and said it's not secure. And we have not taken secure action, sufficient
1972.01s - 1974.01s |  action. But we're doing that now.
1974.01s - 1980.53s |  Yeah. That's great. And two quick notes. So you said secure by design, we've known for a while. We
1980.53s - 1987.77s |  have actually known for almost 52 years. So hey, I'm a college professor by day. And so I've got
1987.77s - 1995.73s |  time to look at this. October 1972, the Anderson report came out and said security cannot be
1995.73s - 2002.25s |  included by retrofit. It has to be included by part of the design. So since 1972, we've known
2002.25s - 2007.41s |  that. The same report said basically the red team always gets through. Meaning the offense has the
2007.41s - 2012.49s |  advantage. The attackers are able to get through. So remember I talked about that miracle? We're
2012.49s - 2018.61s |  50 years into this. Our grandparents had these problems. Unless we can really tackle these hard
2018.61s - 2024.05s |  problems, our grandkids are going to be suffering through the same stuff as we are. And that's kind
2024.05s - 2028.13s |  of depressing, right? To think that they're like our grandkids are going daddy, daddy, we had a
2028.13s - 2029.13s |  DNS issue today.
2029.13s - 2037.73s |  But that's our reality. And that should be our impetus for action. And you talk about these
2037.73s - 2044.65s |  decades old problems. Another one is memory safe programming, or not memory safe programming
2044.65s - 2053.45s |  languages. We've known it for years and years. But we have been slow to address it. And when I read
2053.49s - 2058.21s |  our report that was released earlier this year, building blocks, please take a look at it,
2058.49s - 2064.65s |  critique it, and let us know what you think. I was surprised to learn that that problem has been
2064.65s - 2071.57s |  around for so long. And then I was surprised to learn that the software developers, the community
2071.57s - 2077.97s |  itself, knew about the problem and had been advocating us to make that transition. But for
2077.97s - 2083.37s |  whatever reason, and I'm not into blame, I'm into fixing things. But whatever reason, we didn't
2083.37s - 2091.45s |  take action on that. We're trying to do that now. Along those lines, college professor, we need
2092.41s - 2098.01s |  memory safe programming languages to be taught in colleges and high schools and trade schools and
2098.01s - 2105.65s |  elsewhere. And I was at, I'll say, a service academy, not yours or mine. Earlier this year,
2106.57s - 2114.01s |  talking to a young person about that building blocks report, and I asked the individual if they
2114.01s - 2121.53s |  had read that report. And they had not. So I gave a high level, non-technical synopsis of the
2121.53s - 2126.41s |  report, saying, you know, we need to go to memory safe programming languages. Here are some
2126.41s - 2131.77s |  recommendations. Here are examples of non-memory safe programming languages. And when I ran down
2131.77s - 2137.29s |  the list of non-memory safe programming languages, that individual said, oh, but they're so
2137.29s - 2144.25s |  convenient. And I said, exactly. That's the challenge. Can't always choose convenience over
2144.25s - 2149.85s |  safety and security and reliability. Then I asked the individual, well, when you do graduate and get
2149.85s - 2158.17s |  your commission, what warfare specialty will you go into? And the response was cyber. And I said,
2158.17s - 2162.41s |  well, in a few years, you'll understand better. And that individual will.
2162.97s - 2168.89s |  I mean, it was a quote that I first heard from Dan Geer probably in 2001 or 2002, the enemy of
2168.89s - 2180.12s |  security isn't insecurity, it's convenience. And Dan was so right in so much. So some of my
2180.12s - 2190.12s |  friends who run CornCon in Iowa, they had a project of looking at, we want to look at the text
2190.12s - 2196.36s |  books to see if they're actually teaching good coding procedures. Like, not are we including
2196.36s - 2202.76s |  cyber security in computer science programs, but are we teaching crap in computer science, like,
2202.76s - 2208.36s |  out of date stuff in the programs. And it seems like, you know, I mean, degrees are important.
2208.36s - 2213.88s |  That's a lot of the ways that many of us do get in. And I just wanted to raise that because it
2213.88s - 2220.36s |  struck me as an important idea. Yes. Just yesterday, we visited the College of Southern
2220.36s - 2227.80s |  Nevada. And in our student roundtable, one of the students mentioned and several of the students
2228.68s - 2236.04s |  endorsed that student's perspective that the textbooks that they're using need to be more
2236.04s - 2245.00s |  current. And that's valid. That's a challenge. Our field is evolving so rapidly. But we need to
2245.00s - 2250.36s |  figure out how to at least keep pace. It'd be better if we stayed ahead. But we need to figure
2250.36s - 2257.88s |  out how to keep pace with that. By the way, I saw you dancing on the side of the stage.
2257.88s - 2258.68s |  Yes, sir.
2258.68s - 2261.00s |  Are you tracking the Olympics break dance competition?
2261.08s - 2265.80s |  My gosh, it's great. Yeah. All right. Go Team America, for those of you from America. If not,
2265.80s - 2271.48s |  go whatever your country is. It's just amazing. Especially because it's so, right, especially as
2273.48s - 2279.00s |  computer security professionals, it's really easy to get pessimistic about stuff, right? Every year
2279.00s - 2284.12s |  things seem to kind of get worse. And it's nice. And it seems like everybody hates each other a
2284.12s - 2287.96s |  little more each year. So I'm glad you brought it up because it is great to see what all the
2287.96s - 2293.48s |  athletes are doing, especially when we're putting together. But I didn't make the team this year.
2293.48s - 2299.56s |  And it goes back. Had I not been here, I'd have been in Paris competing. But that does go back
2299.56s - 2305.56s |  to our earlier conversation on cultural change. Plenty of people don't think that's a sport,
2305.56s - 2309.96s |  shouldn't be an Olympic sport, shouldn't have a gold medal. Usually they have great
2309.96s - 2314.04s |  beards like me and you. But we need to evolve with our people.
2314.52s - 2319.88s |  All right. So as we start closing out, there's going to be two questions. And one is,
2322.04s - 2327.00s |  we've talked about some ways people can get involved. The RFIs come out, you can apply to
2327.00s - 2331.56s |  the RFIs, right? The jobs at White House, right? You can go and you can apply to a job at the White
2331.56s - 2338.84s |  House. And like, they're amazing. So I've got a couple ideas. I'd love to hear your ideas on how
2338.84s - 2344.52s |  this community in particular can get involved to help unfuck policy in Washington, D.C.
2344.52s - 2355.00s |  Yeah. I'm big on mentoring and sponsoring. And we've been on a tour of colleges around the
2355.00s - 2361.48s |  country. And what a consistent theme that we've heard from the students is they want to learn
2361.48s - 2371.08s |  more from experienced people. I think there's opportunities for all of us to mentor. I almost
2371.08s - 2377.16s |  said these young people. But fortunately, there are some not so young people also changing their
2377.16s - 2384.52s |  career focus into cybersecurity. So there's opportunities there. We are partnering again
2384.52s - 2391.40s |  with our federal department and agency colleagues on hiring sprints across the country. If you
2391.40s - 2398.76s |  all are hiring, let us know. If you know folks looking for jobs, send them in the direction of
2398.76s - 2404.20s |  those hiring sprints. There are plenty of opportunities. And again, when you look at
2404.20s - 2412.36s |  500,000 open jobs, we need to do that. I want to call out a couple of folks here.
2412.36s - 2416.44s |  Do we have any folks that teach cybersecurity? Please clap. All right. Yeah. Hands up. All right.
2416.44s - 2424.36s |  For those that teach. Any teach at the high school level or below? Good. Only a couple, right?
2426.04s - 2431.72s |  Volunteering at the schools. Doing what you can. Seeing if you can put, right, I was just talking
2431.72s - 2438.12s |  to a colleague at dinner the other day that was at Montana. Was it Montana State? And they didn't
2438.12s - 2443.64s |  have cybersecurity. And he said, let's do this. And they just got $14 million grants and now
2443.64s - 2449.72s |  they're plugging ahead, right? There's room for volunteering and to get things done. So please
2449.72s - 2455.16s |  get out and engage on that and mentoring the rest. I mentioned Tech Congress has amazing fellowships
2455.16s - 2459.88s |  to help those on Congress to get better. Hackers on the Hill, if you're ever in D.C., they have
2459.88s - 2465.96s |  got great projects. And the Policy Village here, it's incredible stuff. It is. And we need to
2465.96s - 2470.68s |  increase it. Again, we need to take those numbers down to something more reasonable.
2471.48s - 2475.64s |  You know, again, back to the National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy,
2476.44s - 2483.32s |  create multiple pathways and remove obstacles. One of the focuses there is we need to
2484.68s - 2493.08s |  do better in recruiting. You and I talked earlier about the numbers male versus female.
2494.04s - 2503.00s |  And how to encourage more participation from girls and ladies in cybersecurity.
2504.44s - 2510.44s |  We were pleased yesterday at the College of Southern Nevada and UNLV. They both have women
2510.44s - 2518.04s |  in cyber clubs. And to my delight, they said the numbers were increasing. The productivity
2518.04s - 2526.20s |  was increasing. And that's a good thing. We need to make opportunities available to every American,
2526.20s - 2533.24s |  to every community across this country. A lot of that is exposing them to the opportunities.
2533.24s - 2537.96s |  Oftentimes, people just don't know about cybersecurity and the good paying jobs,
2537.96s - 2543.72s |  the meaningful careers, a way to help protect themselves, the nation and their loved ones.
2543.96s - 2549.96s |  One other way I'll say you can participate, run for office. You'll see Andrew running around with
2549.96s - 2556.44s |  elect more hackers. However, we just need you. If you think you can do better than those bozos,
2557.88s - 2562.44s |  let's see you in there. And I'm serious. Through DEF CON over the last ten years,
2562.44s - 2565.48s |  we've had a lot of great elected officials who were smart about
2565.48s - 2569.00s |  computer security. But a lot of times they only learned about it once they were in office.
2569.08s - 2573.96s |  And so we can do better. Okay. Closing out our last couple of sips, last question,
2574.60s - 2586.14s |  favorite hacker movie or literature and why? The Oceans series was good for me
2587.18s - 2596.70s |  because it incorporated cyber into the team. And when I look back on my military experience
2597.18s - 2604.38s |  and my operational experience in the intelligence community, we did not always incorporate cyber
2604.38s - 2611.58s |  early on in our missions. And we would have been better served had we done that. So Oceans
2611.58s - 2619.34s |  was a great example of that. And along those lines, when we talk to folks about the importance
2619.42s - 2627.18s |  of cyber, every now and then, too often, we'll hear entities, individuals and collectives talk
2627.18s - 2637.74s |  about cyber being an inconvenience. That's just so wrong. Today and tomorrow and all the tomorrows
2637.74s - 2644.86s |  that come after that, cyber is an imperative, not an inconvenience. And so Oceans got me focused on
2644.86s - 2651.82s |  that and I was pleased that they incorporated cyber into their missions. Great movies. All right.
2651.82s - 2655.98s |  So we're going to leave with that, right? Because worrying about this and taking care of it is an
2655.98s - 2661.66s |  imperative because we have been bequeathed a miracle, right? To finish off with how Harry
2661.66s - 2667.82s |  started off, right? I always capitalize internet because to me it is a precious thing and we're
2667.82s - 2673.58s |  going to screw it up like we screw up everything else, like the air, land, sea, if we don't take
2673.58s - 2679.02s |  care of it. And so I always capitalize internet just to remind ourselves, we might not want to
2679.02s - 2685.66s |  do that, that this is only going to survive. Our grandkids are only going to have something as good
2685.66s - 2691.58s |  as we have now if we fight to keep it so. So thank you. Keep the fight alive and have a great rest
2691.58s - 2693.58s |  of your DEF CON. Thank you, Harry Coker.
