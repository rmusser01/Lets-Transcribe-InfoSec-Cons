**Expedient Digital Defense Overview**
- Focus on using free and credible applications, or recommending paid commercial tools
- Aim to make devices and online presence less harmful
- Discusses experiences of a typical traveler in the U.S. and overseas

**Operational Security (OPSEC)**
- Emphasizes the importance of **Operational Security (OPSEC)**
- Encourages a mindset of seeing communication through the eyes of adversaries
- Highlights the surveillance economy and modern data collection

**Threat Modeling**
- **Threat modeling**: Identify attack surface and threat profile
- Attack surface includes phones, computers, social media, and wireless presence
- Threat profile involves people who can benefit from gaining information

**OPSEC Process**
- **Identify vulnerabilities**: Analyze attack surface
- **Identify threats**: Analyze threat profile
- **Risk analysis**: Decide which vulnerabilities to address
- **Mitigations and defenses**: Implement changes and defenses as needed
- It's a continuous mindset and process

**Security Practices**
- Use of **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** and password managers
- Importance of long, complicated passwords and backups
- **End-to-end encryption**: Recommended for chat and calls

**Social Media and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)**
- Adversaries can gather intelligence from social media profiles
- **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)**: Tools to check internet footprint
- Awareness of data presence is crucial; deleting data is challenging

**Digital Device Security**
- Phones emit many signals; location data is highly valuable to adversaries
- **Wireless anti-tracking**: Reducing location data emissions
- **Smart cities**: Ubiquitous technical surveillance and data collection

**Mitigation Strategies**
- Turn off **Bluetooth and Wi-Fi** when not in use
- Use ad blockers and cookie protection in browsers
- Consider using cash for payments to reduce digital footprint
- Avoid connecting phones to cars due to data access risks

**Security Checkpoints**
- Turn devices off for security checkpoints
- Consider uninstalling sensitive apps temporarily
- Avoid using dummy devices

**VPNs**
- **VPNs**: Provide a secure tunnel for data, but not foolproof
- Change perceived online location, but not a complete security solution

**Conclusion and Recommendations**
- Importance of **physical security** and reducing location exposure
- Practice **online security** by assessing and mitigating vulnerabilities
- Use **end-to-end encryption** for communication security
- Continuous learning and adaptation to new threats and security measures
