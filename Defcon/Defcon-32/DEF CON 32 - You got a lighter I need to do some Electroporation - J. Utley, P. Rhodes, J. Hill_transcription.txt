  "description": "Biological warfare is a phenomenon that spans human history, tracing its roots to ancient times rather than being a recent invention. To gain insights into bioweapons' current and future landscape, it is imperative to look into historical examples of conventional biological warfare and understand how methods were devised and implemented. Our future hinges significantly on our ability to foster transparency and creativity within the global community. This optimism is intertwined with our comprehension of technological advancements, the rapid pace of innovation, the interconnectedness of various domains, and the imperative task of constructing practical defenses against emerging threats. As a poignant reminder, our vulnerability lies in technological shortcomings and our collective failure of imagination. This discourse extends to establishing social norms and mores that are pivotal in shaping attitudes toward biological warfare and encompasses an exploration of prospective research endeavors and emerging initiatives leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) in the realm of bioweaponry. As we confront the intricate interplay between technological advancements and human agency, it is imperative to remain vigilant and resolute in our pursuit of a future safeguarded against the malevolent exploitation of biological agents.",

0.00s - 5.52s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 welcome uh welcome to our talk uh it's titled hey bro you got a lighter i need to do some
5.52s - 11.60s |  electroporation so the first warning is on the defcon website it's mentioned that it's like
11.60s - 17.04s |  about a bio weapon under the description that is not what this talk is about i don't know why i
17.04s - 22.88s |  didn't get fixed but so we'll start with saying that this device that uh we're about ready to
22.88s - 31.57s |  show you should not be used as a bio weapon okay cool moving on um all right so for those that
31.57s - 38.13s |  don't know me my name is dr james utley i have a phd in health science i do kind of a lot of
38.13s - 44.77s |  things in the bio so i'm a i guess i'm a biohacker doubling as a professional scientist and i'll just
44.77s - 48.21s |  go through this real quick so you know that i'm not some yahoo that doesn't know what he's kind
48.21s - 55.17s |  of talking about but i think that title of being a yay who is kind of cooler anyway so anyway first
55.17s - 60.45s |  off is i have the honor and the privilege of being a chief scientific officer at a at a
60.45s - 68.05s |  regenerative medicine stem cell clinic in panama which where i live so whoo go origins we uh that's
68.05s - 75.33s |  my that's my day job i also we're flying today under the flag of viva securus which is myself
75.33s - 81.89s |  phil roads and josh hill otherwise known as the post-6 ninja he couldn't make it here today but
81.89s - 86.05s |  he is a mystical creature that has fueled some of the greatness behind our company for sure
87.01s - 92.13s |  and then uh lastly as i have uh folks here from a biohacker collective we have here in las vegas
92.13s - 99.57s |  called syndicate laboratories it's uh yeah we're a shout out it's a homage to the the yt cracker
99.57s - 107.81s |  album for any of those who didn't get that anyway so uh phil philism is the master of many talents
107.81s - 115.97s |  here uh pentester and i don't know if there is truly like this find a fed type uh but anyway
115.97s - 122.69s |  here's one um meaning he's in the navy so who could go navy all right so yeah you can grab the
122.69s - 127.57s |  contacts there from the qr hopefully people can get them yeah all right moving on let's get into
127.57s - 134.61s |  uh oh yes i want to apologize in advance like i don't mean to offend anyone here on this uh this
134.61s - 140.21s |  talk of like what we're gonna you know but it has been infected with like dad jokes and just just
141.01s - 148.45s |  just some fuckery and i uh so be warned if you want me to say earmuffs beforehand i can but
148.45s - 153.73s |  we're making this we kind of like we're thinking like hey are we overusing memes and then we're
153.73s - 159.89s |  like no no let's just let's just go with it right and uh so you'll see anyway moving on
161.73s - 168.05s |  so this is where we're going to start uh so where this all started here is this is what we're we've
168.05s - 174.53s |  developed you know what we've kind of like take the next generation of is is from an electro pen
174.53s - 180.29s |  right so you see some of these like university students here that put together an electroporation
180.29s - 186.21s |  device and we'll kind of get into like we're trying to keep this talk like very kind of simple
186.21s - 192.85s |  and easy to digest and so um but anyway this is where it started and these college kids did a
192.85s - 201.57s |  great job of like really uh taking this barbecue lighter um and then electroporating uh or in
201.57s - 207.73s |  trans transfecting some uh some dna from extracellular to inside the cell and that's what
207.73s - 214.69s |  this that's what this talk is because we took their study and we uh made the next i mean basically
214.69s - 221.25s |  it's an easier device to assemble in my in my opinion um but the key take-home point here is that
222.93s - 229.17s |  we want to stress that like the there's the potential for to democratize science using
229.17s - 236.29s |  frugal tools and that's really what kind of this whole thing is about is that you the people can
236.29s - 239.73s |  learn about these techniques whether it's genetic engineering whether it's you know science in
239.73s - 246.05s |  general um however however you like be able to to learn it from the comfort of your own home
247.97s - 254.50s |  anyway moving on and yeah i guess i kind of started that i started my rant already right
254.50s - 259.06s |  so we just like you know the access to electroporation technology or genetic engineering
259.06s - 265.14s |  that you can uh you know the sky's the limit and you know and kind of like what is your imagination
265.14s - 271.14s |  and how to uh you know transfect cells or genetic engineering and this is just one way to do it and
271.14s - 278.18s |  it allows that like those the people can then uh you know identify like what uh you know that they
278.18s - 283.94s |  have the the skills and the resources and the know-how to do these type of experiments and it
283.94s - 291.30s |  doesn't have to be confined by fancy instruments or you know big pharma or you know or academia
291.30s - 297.38s |  just kind of like locking it up you know science is for everyone so this is just one example
298.66s - 303.78s |  now some of this stuff is already done in biohacker labs that are you know out throughout
303.78s - 309.54s |  the community and you know i i really uh i really appreciate that community and that's why
309.54s - 315.22s |  i try to invest my time and my effort into into the biohacker community meaning like the genetic
315.22s - 320.42s |  engineer diy bio those folks because it's important i know i've noticed over like the
320.42s - 325.62s |  last five years that they just become like less uh i guess maybe less organized or maybe less
325.62s - 331.54s |  prevalent and so if you uh if you have a curiosity for science then you know find a community and
331.54s - 340.83s |  join it so for sure okay now this is a little bit of a the detour here but it's all in the same
340.83s - 346.99s |  row so so so bear with me here transfection is actually what we're trying to do through
346.99s - 353.63s |  electroporation so we're trying to use electricity to develop a pore in a cell to then insert from
353.63s - 360.43s |  an extracellular maybe that's a dna or rna into the cell to hijack uh you know hijack the machinery
360.43s - 370.35s |  and or uh express a different protein now because i am a one a big nicholas cage fan and i like the
370.35s - 376.35s |  the fact of i like electroporation this presentation has been transfected with
376.35s - 381.79s |  nicholas cage memes and so if you see it's a process used in genetic engineering you know
381.79s - 389.71s |  from foreign into the cell so the challenge is here when we get to the end um that there is a
390.27s - 397.15s |  number of nicholas cage memes and or references and or uh and i'll i'll give you one hard one but
397.15s - 401.15s |  at the end we'll see uh we'll see if every you know we have a last slide here that will
401.79s - 408.75s |  that we can see uh how many how many nicholas cage references we have seen and i will also agree that
409.31s - 417.07s |  nicholas cage's face on things is the best thing i've ever looked up so okay all right and again
417.07s - 422.11s |  i'm sorry i'm sorry that you chose this session because there's uh some some some terrible memes
422.11s - 427.87s |  and dad jokes anyway this was so how this all started for me personally is that i realized
427.87s - 432.27s |  from that paper that you could use a lighter to it's not for smoking it's for electroporation
432.27s - 439.79s |  poration and so i wrote this like really cringy type sub stack post uh some years ago and with
439.79s - 446.19s |  that we're like okay well let's see if we can fucking do this thing for real and that's where
446.19s - 451.15s |  it kind of all started um so welcome to the biovault revolution you didn't know that you
451.15s - 456.51s |  were attending this talk and it's a you know a low-cost portable electroporator which just means
456.51s - 460.91s |  it's a barbecue lighter and maybe phil you want to show like what the device looks like
461.63s - 468.83s |  and it's you know inspired by a barbecue lighter or the pzt or the piezoelectric effect of a of a
468.83s - 474.75s |  light of a lighter to start a barbecue and it's meant to you know bring synthetic biology to the
474.75s - 481.55s |  masses okay so electroporation 101 and i'm sorry i'm going through this fast because we only have
481.55s - 487.95s |  a limited amount of time so it's a technique to deliver molecules you know dna into cells right
487.95s - 493.23s |  and it uses electropulses right which is the clicking of the lighter to create a pore which
493.23s - 498.35s |  then uh it then it will enter so sometimes when you're like when you're trying to select
499.39s - 502.83s |  you're trying to select what you want to electroporate or trans infect
503.55s - 508.67s |  uh you get kind of confused like this is what's what's right you know dna rna or whatever but
508.67s - 514.91s |  that's part of the uh that's part of the journey here because this is really part one of really
514.91s - 521.23s |  three phases of a project part one meaning that this is the tool and we're going to try to show
521.23s - 527.47s |  you how we can provide some reproducibility on the tool to electroporate or at um and then step
527.47s - 532.03s |  two is really the plasmid selection like what do you want to put inside the cell and then the last
532.03s - 539.31s |  part is like recovery and counting which we'll kind of gloss over at the end okay electroporation
539.31s - 544.03s |  101 so the first thing to start with is it's not easy it's really difficult to do it in a diy
544.03s - 550.03s |  environment it is really difficult and so it's really carefully uh hinged on parameters like
550.03s - 556.75s |  optimizing those parameters which means like the gap the amount of uh you know trigger the pulse
556.75s - 563.55s |  and those type of things and uh so the electric field the ionic composition of the the fluid in
563.55s - 569.71s |  which you're putting your dna with to transfect the cells in which you which you you have chosen
570.35s - 575.63s |  um so it's actually really it's actually really difficult difficult so as you know if you take
575.63s - 580.11s |  this home and you want to do it just know that it's very very hard um but it's not possible and
580.11s - 586.51s |  you see here i've got like a little picture of the cuvette we call it the cuvette and it has a
586.51s - 593.15s |  microfluidic well which you kind of develop and through the pulsing it provides some electricity
594.03s - 601.47s |  and that's that's that right so again we're going to talk about we're going to talk about how we're
601.47s - 608.11s |  taking a nucleic acid sequence and we're trying to take it from extracellular and put it inside the
608.11s - 614.67s |  cell and i will this is my the freebie here if you look at the nucleus of this meme here um nucleus
614.67s - 623.12s |  cage i don't know hopefully somebody finds that funny moving on okay so another breakdown here
624.64s - 630.48s |  you know you have like this plasmid right so you have like your fluid in which you're
630.48s - 635.60s |  and i guess i i should say that pbs or phosphate buffered saline is really good
636.24s - 641.92s |  um and you want to you want to add your dna and what you've chosen right um with this with
641.92s - 647.28s |  your cells and give it a good pulse you'll see on the right hand side and by doing so it opens up a
647.28s - 654.64s |  pore and that plasmid will then uh become intracellular that's the ultimate goal that's
654.64s - 664.51s |  what you're trying to do um and yeah so why are we doing this we're why are we doing this is because
665.39s - 670.51s |  you know we're all part banana and some of us are part you know if you ever and the broader
670.51s - 676.59s |  point is that if you want to learn about this to make yourself a nicholas cage hybrid banana
677.15s - 680.99s |  like you should be able to right nobody should tell you you can't do that so
681.87s - 689.92s |  you know that's the uh that's the that's the essence there okay so spoiler alert the device
689.92s - 696.80s |  is really ugly and you'll see on the left hand side of this slide there you see it's just a
696.80s - 704.32s |  barbecue lighter and it has the trigger which is the uh the pzt effect and we've kind of like
704.32s - 709.44s |  optimized it and if you were ever wanted to look back at the college kids that did this before
710.08s - 715.36s |  they 3d printed this nice housing environment that had some wires that kind of delivered
716.00s - 721.84s |  but it was definitely difficult to to like you know uh to make contact with the cuvette and
721.84s - 727.04s |  really it's about like the consistency of the fluid the micro the microfluidic well
727.04s - 732.96s |  or a channel if you will um and the cuvette that really kind of makes a difference um you'll see
732.96s - 737.92s |  there's some other equipment of course this is a pipette um and then on the right hand side there
737.92s - 743.36s |  was like some crazy ideas like okay if i'm going to put a i'm going to try to have it migrate down
743.36s - 750.32s |  a microfluidic well and then kind of aggregate there and then uh then zap it there uh no did
750.32s - 755.68s |  not really work because it just killed cells which we'll talk about later um okay moving on
757.04s - 759.76s |  because it's so ugly you know maybe it's the greatest threat to world peace
760.40s - 767.52s |  okay light laugh no okay all right all right we're moving on um we were had this like running joke
767.52s - 771.28s |  about this full body electroporation i don't know if this movie is going to give us if this will
771.28s - 778.24s |  give us sounds but it's like okay let's what's oh all right okay and there's no sound but you
778.24s - 786.48s |  can outplay as luigi again i i already apologized up front um okay yeah but back to back to it yes
786.48s - 794.72s |  this is still a very ugly device and um but it's cheap that's the uh that's the part it's uh it's
794.72s - 800.08s |  cheap to make and you can make it at your home it's very crude um and you can get all these these
800.08s - 805.76s |  items here um i don't know phil let's see we didn't we don't have the heat shrink well wire
805.76s - 811.68s |  insulator but that's like duct tape or a electrical tape the aluminum tape is kind of a conductive
811.68s - 818.88s |  material um that you want to put over the magnets there's a roll of adhesive magnets there that we
818.88s - 824.32s |  kind of stack and that kind of makes that field and then you have the the aluminum overlay that
824.32s - 830.08s |  kind of is a conductive material to make the cuvette and then it's like nine volt battery
830.08s - 836.72s |  kind of a and it doesn't travel very well i'll say that um they're kind of wondering like what
836.72s - 842.80s |  the fuck is that um because i live in panama i travel here so anyway um so we made some more
842.80s - 847.36s |  devices when we got back but it's definitely cheaper than uh and we'll see if this lands
847.36s - 851.12s |  we'll see if this joke lands it's definitely more than the ten dollar uber eats card you
851.12s - 858.16s |  receive because of the crowd strike windows outage nobody nobody yeah okay good it landed it
858.16s - 872.46s |  landed it already expired wow okay so i'm glad the joke landed there because yeah okay uh again
872.46s - 877.34s |  i guess we kind of kind of talked on this at one point here on this slide is this smart glass bio
877.34s - 882.06s |  interface which is a really cool name for a microscope slide they seem to work uh well
882.06s - 887.02s |  when you're trying to develop the arc gap so yeah just a standard microscope
888.54s - 896.94s |  okay uh and you know as so the point here is to kind of like iterate on do you know find crazy
896.94s - 901.98s |  devices and as long as you can insert this pzt crystal or the pzeo electric crystal
902.62s - 909.34s |  uh effect then you could essentially make it an electroporator and i was using superglue to
909.34s - 912.54s |  like develop part of the device and i was like hey you know what i'm gonna use this like
912.54s - 917.18s |  superglue casing to make another one and i put a little washer there and then that red cap
917.18s - 922.78s |  became like the spring and i was like okay this will do it you know um anyway the point is like
922.78s - 931.50s |  you know use your imagination um but the pro tip is that the the bic lighters they suck you know
931.50s - 936.14s |  they're probably great lighters but when you're trying to do that trying to make an electroporator
936.14s - 941.98s |  from from the device they suck we they suck so bad that we took a part two and we're like okay
941.98s - 946.62s |  can we put this thing you know make it a device and then we're like i don't think so and then we
946.62s - 950.22s |  were so genius that we're like you know what we should need to do we need to get another one
950.22s - 955.34s |  and fail for the third time and we did we did in that so pro tip bic lighters suck
956.94s - 961.10s |  um again you know i've like talked about this like it's the power of the voltage
961.74s - 969.74s |  um the piezoelectric effect from the crystal here right and it's uh you'll see this next
969.74s - 976.70s |  couple slides of how how firing is it important important i took this uh one of the words from the
976.70s - 981.98s |  from the college kids that first did this electropen and they said it's very reliable
982.70s - 986.70s |  you know and i'm like okay so there's fair reproducibility which we'll get into
987.26s - 990.86s |  um but that's it you're trying to get over around this like 2 000 volts
992.78s - 998.78s |  um this is actually a little close whoa extreme close-up
1000.54s - 1004.70s |  um okay well here's another and here's another aspect or an important part
1005.42s - 1011.18s |  of of the assembly here which is the cuvette or we were calling it earlier the bio interface
1012.14s - 1018.46s |  and it's if you show that fill you'll see that it's aluminum tape wrapped around it some adhesive
1018.46s - 1025.34s |  magnets on top of some glass pretty crude pretty awesome and in the center picture here these are
1025.34s - 1032.22s |  kind of like some weird configurations i was like hey you know what let's try to adjust the arc gap
1032.22s - 1037.58s |  which which you'll see or let's try to develop a well let's see what works the best you know
1037.58s - 1044.38s |  they were trying to contain me but in a cage made of necklace um and this is the arc gap which i
1044.38s - 1049.58s |  think i'd say at this when you're developing this device or building this device that actually is
1049.58s - 1056.22s |  kind of the most important part and it it is size does matter so most of the literature around
1056.22s - 1063.02s |  electroporation on like a like a like a no shit commercial device is around the one millimeter
1063.02s - 1070.86s |  arc gap um so you see that but we used two really scientific indexes to kind of mess with the gap
1070.86s - 1078.54s |  the first one being the post-it note index so if you take the post-it notes at around 10 or
1078.54s - 1084.14s |  five and fold them in half it gives you kind of a start but then we went we're like hey you know
1084.14s - 1090.70s |  what this is vegas and we need uh another method which is the playing card index so if you start
1090.70s - 1095.34s |  with five playing cards gives you that nice gap but if you want to extend it out to two millimeters
1095.34s - 1102.46s |  just add an extra playing card before while you're while you're yeah when you're uh as you're
1102.46s - 1107.42s |  developing this the the point is you know try it you know mess with it because it is important
1108.14s - 1115.58s |  on uh on zapping these cells and what lighter is the best we found that it's the scripto
1115.58s - 1126.91s |  aim and flame it's fire yes follow them on facebook all right now this is where myself and
1126.91s - 1133.15s |  phil decided to get a little crazy in terms of testing we wanted to look at what these college
1133.15s - 1136.91s |  kids did in their study and then it's like hey let's see if we can kind of reproduce something
1136.91s - 1144.67s |  or provide some scientific value to this and um but as it says on the slide i'm not a crystal
1144.67s - 1151.23s |  wizard or an electrician so you know but the short of it is we zap this thing with a high voltage
1151.23s - 1157.79s |  multimeter and we were getting some reproducibility but it looks like we have uh each fire is two
1157.79s - 1162.59s |  seconds in between and then we waited two minutes and if you can see that you know you don't have
1162.59s - 1167.55s |  to be a genius to see kind of a pattern here that two clicks is good then it drops off right so it
1167.55s - 1173.87s |  kind of decays which has some correlation with what's on the left hand side even though there
1173.87s - 1180.51s |  is a lot of different lighters here and this voltage curve which uh anyway so there's some
1180.51s - 1186.91s |  reproducibility is the point moving on here's the was the raw data so you know that uh it's not just
1186.91s - 1193.39s |  a terrible color chart and then we have this other setting on the multimeter called resistance
1193.39s - 1199.23s |  and again we're not crystal wizards or electricians so we're like hey let's try to hook this thing up
1199.23s - 1204.27s |  and see what the resistance looks like meaning that we can provide reproducibility and sure
1204.27s - 1210.03s |  enough we did it has this nice nice curve there so because we're trying to answer the question
1210.03s - 1214.83s |  is this device does it have some reliability that then you can control the other variables
1214.83s - 1220.51s |  to actually get the dna or the rna inside the cell and so we're saying yes all right now we're
1220.51s - 1226.67s |  going to play this video real quick because i'm running out of time and this is my office here in
1226.67s - 1235.31s |  panama in my biohacker lab anyway here's a device phil shows it it's a click click click
1236.99s - 1239.95s |  i'm gonna fast forward here just a little bit
1241.23s - 1244.83s |  and then you hook that guy up the cuvette and if you really want to
1246.99s - 1251.15s |  well again it's hard to do and there's a lot of trial and error but you can kind of pre-chill
1251.15s - 1256.11s |  that cuvette cuvette so then when you're adding your plasmid or your electrocompetent cells
1256.83s - 1260.11s |  then it uh you're trying to reduce the amount of cell death that you're
1260.83s - 1269.60s |  you know you're the creator of death death of cells um all right so we're gonna yeah okay you
1269.60s - 1274.80s |  put that's where you're gonna put the the fluid the stuff the dna the cells and the phosphate
1274.80s - 1281.28s |  buffered saline and while i'm going through this i'll oh i have a look i also have a little note
1281.28s - 1288.08s |  card because there was things i didn't want to miss around this part which is they you know
1288.08s - 1292.88s |  there's a recommended 2.5 microliters of dna like that's kind of the max if you do more of that and
1292.88s - 1298.96s |  in terms of plasma generation uh it's not very efficient you can use pbs and or sterile water
1298.96s - 1303.68s |  but if you have like contaminants then it kind of messes with uh it'll mess with the the
1303.68s - 1310.32s |  electroporation uh transformation effect uh you're going to kill a lot of cells so this is on this
1310.32s - 1316.48s |  video this is where i'm i'm uh uh providing the inoculum or um the plasmid in through the
1316.48s - 1323.44s |  microfluidic well and and then i'm gonna buzz it okay good video over but the take-home point here
1323.44s - 1330.64s |  is to make sure that you know that you're going to be killing a lot of cells so um and that's just
1330.64s - 1335.04s |  that's just the nature of electroporation i think the literature supports that like between 50 and
1335.04s - 1341.12s |  70 percent of cells are destroyed in this process on these with uh electroporator devices
1343.20s - 1349.28s |  and but uh but you're going to because these it's kind of a more uncontrolled if you will
1349.28s - 1354.88s |  you're going to provide a lot of cell death okay so transformation why what are some things that
1354.88s - 1361.44s |  you can test this guy on you can use ecolite electrocompetent ecoli is very so in terms of
1361.44s - 1368.24s |  electroporation or transfection it's a easier to do uh we had talked about some yeast and then me
1368.24s - 1375.44s |  as of course being a uh stem cell scientist um i was like okay let's hit it up with some stem cells
1375.44s - 1384.96s |  now um like let's see the uh the reporter marker if you will um uh it's really good for the green
1384.96s - 1389.44s |  fluorescent protein or the super folding green fluorescent protein is because when you incubate
1389.44s - 1395.68s |  them then you can see it on the see it on the back end anyway um we're gonna you'll see this
1395.68s - 1401.04s |  is electroporator device here on the on the slide here and of course nicholas nicholas cage is always
1401.04s - 1407.92s |  trying to reinvent himself obviously now we're getting to the last part here is the so this is
1407.92s - 1412.88s |  kind of after we're not talking about the tool but we're talking about the the protocol for cloning
1414.16s - 1419.92s |  you can see in this nice meme here that when you're you're you've already transformed yourselves
1419.92s - 1424.88s |  using this commercial electroporator and then of course this barbecue barbecue lighter that we have
1424.88s - 1429.60s |  here then you look at the colonies and you're like okay there's no colonies and then you have no idea
1429.60s - 1433.52s |  what went wrong and then you cry and then you repeat it and you adjust and that's the whole
1433.52s - 1438.32s |  thing about science you know you just kind of have to adjust the parameters to get it right on and if
1438.32s - 1445.60s |  you do so you can cross the holy grail and make your nicholas cage banana hybrid and the cell
1445.60s - 1449.20s |  recovery is a really tough thing which i think we're like running out of time on that one but
1449.20s - 1456.16s |  here's a short little picture of like uh and this took many iterations but if you see and i'm glad
1456.16s - 1460.64s |  i took a good picture of this even though not so good you see there's kind of this wave of these
1460.64s - 1470.00s |  tiny little colonies those uh graciously were conducted via the bio volt or the electroporator
1470.00s - 1477.60s |  or pen yeah okay troubleshooting now the troubleshooting is of course i have talked about
1477.60s - 1482.32s |  there's a lot of cell death you are the destroyer of worlds when it comes to this a lot of cells are
1482.32s - 1487.12s |  going to die but all you need is a small portion to grow and then you're like okay mission complete
1487.12s - 1491.76s |  the excessive arcing remember the uh some some of the two methods that we said you know use the
1491.76s - 1495.12s |  the playing card index it's really great i like i actually like that one a lot
1495.12s - 1501.20s |  uh but you can adjust the arc and then but you should keep in mind that despite whatever prior
1501.20s - 1508.16s |  studies or even around electroporators that it is it has low efficiency meaning like it doesn't
1508.16s - 1515.39s |  work all the fucking time so you just got to know that going into it um if you want the protocol you
1515.39s - 1520.27s |  can choose your adventure here um one of these will lead you to an access point where we could
1520.27s - 1532.35s |  provide a protocol to have one build and whatever else but it uh so have a look see and then where's
1532.35s - 1540.27s |  my goon or what am i good on time still yeah okay good yeah okay cool um all right and now
1540.27s - 1555.01s |  we move to the uh the key of cage and we will pause here oh uno minuto yeah okay we're at one minute
1555.73s - 1562.53s |  and uh so if uh anybody have a guess how many how many memes we got nickels cage memes
1566.21s - 1577.33s |  send it go ahead 12 that's 1 2 12 yeah no there there there is a there is there's more than that
1578.21s - 1583.89s |  there is ah you got it he's the guy right there if you put 20 here he's kind of like a ruse
1583.89s - 1587.17s |  and then there was that extra one which you must have been scanning qr codes
1587.17s - 1595.65s |  ah oh oh congratulations congratulations okay well yeah we have something for you
1595.65s - 1602.05s |  uh okay well that is our talk um it was it was brief but remember this is tool one of a
1602.05s - 1607.41s |  electroporating journey i hope people try it you know the biohacking community if you uh have an
1607.41s - 1614.21s |  inclination for science then you know please reach out to one of us and and uh again we fly under the
1614.21s - 1620.37s |  flag of viva securis which is actually a medical device pen testing company um and then this right
1620.37s - 1625.33s |  this last is you know remember please don't do coke in the bathroom it uh this is a real sign
1625.33s - 1629.97s |  somewhere in the world for all you osin folks you can go find it thank you
