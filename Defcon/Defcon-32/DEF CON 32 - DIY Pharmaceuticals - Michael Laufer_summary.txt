**DIY Pharmaceuticals and MicroLab**

- **Problem with Hepatitis C Treatment:**
  - **Hepatitis C** causes a quarter-million deaths yearly
  - **Sofosbuvir** is a cure but costs $1,000 USD per pill
  - **Gilead Pharmaceuticals** holds the **Intellectual Property** and refuses to share

- **DIY Solution:**
  - Developed a method to produce the treatment for $300 USD
  - Methodology can be applied to other diseases
  - Use of a **MicroLab** to automate drug synthesis

- **MicroLab Features:**
  - **Automated System** for easy use by non-chemists
  - Composed of a hardware and software stack
  - Includes a **Recipe Press** for writing programs for the hardware
  - **Retrosynthesis**: Start with material and work to desired drug

- **Chemical Automation:**
  - Existing systems are closed source and expensive
  - DIY version is open source and costs around $300
  - Can be assembled with common materials and tools

- **MicroLab Construction:**
  - **Reaction Chamber**: Two mason jars with a circulating fluid for temperature control
  - **Peristaltic Pumps** for injecting reagents
  - **3D Printed Armature** for assembly
  - **Raspberry Pi** and **Arduino** control the system

- **Software and Operation:**
  - GUI interface for ease of use
  - **Automated Steps** and **Human Steps** clearly defined
  - Supports **Branching Processes** for decision-making in reactions

- **Chemhacktica:**
  - Started in 2018, now more efficient
  - Uses **SMILES code** to encode molecules and reactions
  - Searches chemical literature for synthesis pathways

- **Community and Collaboration:**
  - Encourages sharing of synthesis files
  - Potential for crowdsource community to tackle procedures
  - Open invitation for volunteers to join and contribute

- **Safety and Compounding:**
  - Emphasis on **Sterile Technique** for injectable forms
  - Importance of safe handling and compounding to avoid contamination

- **Future Goals and Challenges:**
  - Looking to utilize **AI** for navigating scientific literature
  - Ongoing work to update the system with new data and features

**Call to Action**

- Encouragement to join the effort in making pharmaceuticals accessible
- Emphasis on teaching and sharing knowledge to enhance community capability
