**Introduction to GPS and Aviation**

- Discusses the importance of **time** in aviation
- Mentions **GNSS** and **GPS** as critical components, using terms interchangeably
- Introduces the speaker's background as a **red teamer** and **pen tester** in aviation

**Speaker's Personal Experiences**

- Shares anecdotes about being a **bad pilot** with various incidents 
- Founded a **pen testing firm** in 2002
- Enjoys flying **Piper Cherokee 6** and old Russian airliners

**Aviation Navigation Systems**

- **Non-Directional Beacons (NDBs)**:
  - Simple indicators with long range but can mislead in thunderstorms
  - Still used in remote locations
  
- **VOR (VHF Omnidirectional Range)**:
  - Easier to use and more accurate than NDBs
  - Found at intersections of airways but expensive to maintain

- **DME (Distance Measuring Equipment)**:
  - Provides accurate distance using time of flight

- **ILS (Instrument Landing System)**:
  - Allows precise landing in poor visibility but expensive to maintain

- **Inertial Reference Systems**:
  - Used where GPS is unavailable
  - Very accurate but not precise enough for landing

**GPS and Position Errors**

- Increasing reliance on **GPS** as traditional nav aids are retired
- **GPS spoofing** and **jamming** incidents, especially in conflict zones
- **Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS)** issues due to position errors

**Time as a Critical Component**

- **GPS** provides a critical source of time for aviation systems
- Reports of **GPS time** errors affecting digital certificates and communication systems
- Importance of accurate time for systems like **TCAS** and incident logging

**Future of Navigation and Time Management**

- Emphasizes the need for a **hybrid** system using GPS and ground systems
- Importance of maintaining **existing nav aids** for cross-checking
- Other sectors, like **financial services**, also rely on accurate GPS time

**Conclusion**

- Encourages further research and development in **GPS spoofing** and time management
- Promotes attending related talks for more insights into aviation and GPS technology
