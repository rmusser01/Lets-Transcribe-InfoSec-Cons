  "title": "DEF CON 32 - If Existing Cyber Vulns Magically Disappeared, What Next - Dr  Stefanie Tompkins",
  "description": "The DEF CON community challenges the status quo, bringing a diversity of perspectives and ideas to identify hidden problems and solutions. While DARPA lays claim to the origin of the ARPANET/internet, vast communities of people with different interests created its novel components. The DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge helped launch the field of vulnerability detection and remediation and numerous DARPA Cyber Fast Track program performers continue to contribute to DEF CON.\n\nWhat if current vulnerabilities all magically disappeared overnight and critical infrastructure were \u201csafe and secure\u201d for the time being. What would come next?\n\nIn this talk, Dr. Stefanie Tompkins will discuss the value of the hacker community and many of the contributions that have come from it, as well as the growth and synergy of the two communities. She\u2019ll also explore the question of what comes next.\n\nFor a deeper dive into the real-world impacts of DARPA cyber technologies, Dr. Renee Wegrzyn, the inaugural director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), will join Stefanie and a moderator. They will discuss efforts that impact DEF CON areas of interest and inform ARPA-H work, from Cyber Fast Track to current work focused on securing and defending hospitals and the health tech ecosystem from cyberattacks.",

1.55s - 28.35s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 twenty seconds. So, my name's Stephanie Tompkins. I'm the director of a little organization
28.35s - 32.95s |  called DARPA. That stands for Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. I'm really thrilled
32.95s - 37.19s |  to be here talking to you today. Uh, what I want to do is talk to you about what keeps
37.19s - 43.17s |  me up at night. So, when I talk to people about DARPA, it turns out most of them know,
43.17s - 47.31s |  if they've ever heard of us at all, most of them know what we're famous for. Um, that
47.31s - 54.55s |  would be things like, uh, the internet. Uh, stealth technology. Um, maybe a little more
54.55s - 60.47s |  obscure, but the actual creation of material science as an academic discipline, from which
60.47s - 65.47s |  things like semiconductors and alloys and things like that all sort of arose. So, lots
65.47s - 71.35s |  of really big things. Um, they're also super aware that, um, the first word in DARPA is
71.35s - 75.19s |  defense, right? So, we work for the Department of Defense. We spend a lot of time thinking
75.23s - 81.27s |  about national security. So, when people ask me, uh, what keeps me up at night, I'm pretty
81.27s - 87.91s |  sure they're expecting one of two things. A huge military risk area, and, and there are
87.91s - 92.05s |  certainly plenty of them. I think you've heard a number of them already today. Um, or some
92.05s - 100.03s |  really massive technological gap. Truthfully, what keeps me up at night the most is the
100.03s - 105.77s |  fact that there are probably amazing national security ideas out there that we are just
105.77s - 111.81s |  not hearing. Because the way DARPA works, our ideas are coming in at us and we are
111.81s - 116.75s |  trying things from sort of a bottoms-up process over and over and over again, missing the
116.75s - 123.43s |  idea that is going to change the world. That's terrifying. So, um, you know, one thing I
123.43s - 128.17s |  know is that there are many, many communities out there, uh, across the country, across
128.17s - 134.53s |  this world, um, that have amazing ideas, extraordinary expertise, and an in-depth way at
134.53s - 140.83s |  looking at problems that collectively we at DARPA just might not be, uh, um, aware of. And
140.83s - 145.37s |  I should say, you know, so we understand there's some barriers to entry to that. I'm going
145.37s - 149.17s |  to talk about that. But I, I think it's actually worth pointing out that this particular
149.17s - 153.79s |  community and DARPA, um, have quite a history of working together. Um, probably more than
153.79s - 160.63s |  most people realize. So, um, take the internet. I talked about DARPA in the internet. The
160.63s - 167.13s |  truth is what DARPA actually did was we created something called, uh, the ARPANET. And it's
167.13s - 172.77s |  in no small part this community that helped graduate the ARPANET into the internet, um,
172.77s - 178.97s |  that we know and love or don't love on any given day, um, uh, today. So the original
178.97s - 185.43s |  ARPANET, uh, think about this. It was basically designed so that one specialized computer
185.43s - 189.97s |  could talk to another specialized computer in a different part of the country. Uh, remember
189.97s - 194.01s |  back then computers were the size of refrigerators or entire rooms and they cost a whole lot
194.01s - 198.85s |  of money. So it didn't make a lot of sense to be redundant, um, with everybody having
198.85s - 203.73s |  the same capabilities. And the original ARPANET was also really focused on being able to,
203.73s - 209.09s |  uh, be resistant to disruptions. Uh, and so that led to things like packet switching.
209.09s - 214.61s |  So TCPIP, um, which was a huge radical change from this sort of circuit based technology
214.65s - 219.81s |  that were running communications back then, think, uh, you know, basically telephone calls.
219.81s - 225.45s |  Oh, and by the way, I should mention, the very first thing typed into the ARPANET was
225.45s - 232.33s |  meant to be login. They got L, they got O, and then the system crashed. Just remember
232.33s - 237.13s |  that because I'm going to come back to that part later. Um, but no, so thinking about
237.13s - 242.17s |  the transformation of the ARPANET into the internet, it was a lot of poking and prodding
242.17s - 246.89s |  at strengths and weaknesses, um, in the system, identification of vulnerabilities, coming
246.89s - 252.05s |  up with, uh, solutions, improvements, all of that from, you know, communities like this
252.05s - 258.97s |  one, but this one in particularly, which ultimately led to, um, the transformation into the internet
258.97s - 263.49s |  and into something which I think most of us will agree fundamentally changed how this
263.49s - 270.33s |  world, our entire world works, um, lives and communicates. Now that type of transformation
270.33s - 277.29s |  is what DARPA is all about. We're focused on making really big bets, um, on high risk,
277.29s - 281.69s |  you know, new technologies, things that we think are fundamentally going to be revolutionary
281.69s - 286.61s |  and disruptive and game changing, right? Those are all overused words, but they are words
286.61s - 291.01s |  that we live and breathe and we actually mean them when we talk about that. So DARPA, it's
291.01s - 296.33s |  not about making something 5% better or 10% better or even 50% better. It's about making
296.33s - 300.81s |  it 5,000 times better or it's about saying the thing that we want to make better. We're
300.81s - 304.13s |  just going to get rid of it altogether and we're going to move to an entirely different
304.13s - 308.21s |  solution space. Maybe we're going to create new problems, but we're essentially moving
308.21s - 314.41s |  entirely out of the domain of the problem that might feel too hard to solve. Now, um,
314.41s - 320.25s |  I should point out that sometimes the timing isn't right or sometimes we were just wrong
320.25s - 325.77s |  or we failed. We set these massive audacious goals and we didn't meet them. The truth is
325.77s - 331.01s |  that should happen a lot because if we're succeeding at all our goals, it means we are
331.01s - 336.05s |  not doing our job. Um, and we are not taking the big risks, which is what we have actually
336.05s - 341.49s |  been chartered to do. And for what it's worth, um, sometimes we learn a lot more from our
341.49s - 345.69s |  failures or as much from our failures as we do from our successes. And so we celebrate
345.69s - 350.37s |  our failures. Um, but when we do succeed, our belief is that those successes should
350.37s - 355.41s |  be fundamentally changing the world. And one of the things I actually find amazing is when
355.41s - 360.21s |  we look back on those things where we were successful as the movement from this is utterly
360.21s - 369.41s |  impossible to, okay, maybe, but probably not to, well, of course it's inevitable. And how
369.41s - 375.49s |  did we can't even imagine what life was like before. So I'll give you a few, um, a few
375.49s - 383.45s |  additional examples, uh, miniaturized, uh, GPS. So every time you use a GPS enabled device,
383.45s - 391.57s |  that was DARPA, uh, graphical user interfaces, DARPA, uh, the mouse, who knew the mouse would
391.57s - 398.21s |  become so ubiquitous, or maybe you don't use a mouse, but you use a touchscreen, both DARPA
398.21s - 403.69s |  voice recognition and Siri in particular, love it or hate it. We will accept responsibility.
403.69s - 411.23s |  Um, accelerometers, the wireless capabilities at the core of today's smartphones and tablets.
411.23s - 419.27s |  We kicked off the self-driving car industry, brain machine interfaces. So, um, those are
419.27s - 423.71s |  the, the, all things that link back to major DARPA investments. And a lot of those are
423.71s - 428.87s |  things that you have probably heard about. Um, what might be a little less well known
428.87s - 432.99s |  are the more recent interactions that we have had with this community in particular. So
432.99s - 438.91s |  I'm going to ask for a show of hands. How many of you have used Nmap? Okay. That's a
438.91s - 443.79s |  lot of hands. Right. So DARPA was actually instrumental there. Um, exploring ways to
443.79s - 450.23s |  map and learn from an environment containing 4 billion IP addresses to one of 340 trillion,
450.23s - 460.87s |  so IPv4 to IPv6. How about HackRF? Right? Okay, so the creation of a $340 transmit and
460.87s - 465.71s |  receive software defined radio, um, completely lowering the barrier to entry for hackers
465.75s - 471.31s |  and being really transformative in how we interact, um, with spectrum. Um, how about
471.31s - 477.71s |  Onion Routing? Uh, the underpinnings of Tor. Onion Routing was developed actually by the
477.71s - 482.55s |  Navy, but as part of a DARPA program. And the team then decided to release that tech,
482.55s - 487.27s |  that technology open source. Um, it's now used by millions of people every day, helping
487.27s - 492.67s |  to give people a voice all around the world. Or how about that, uh, car hacking? The one
492.67s - 496.57s |  that made the news a few years back? Maybe more than a few years back. I'm, I'm feeling my
496.57s - 500.41s |  age. Uh, but remember when Charlie Miller and Chris Vlachek demonstrated they could
500.41s - 504.81s |  remotely hack a car while the reporter was still inside? Yeah, that was DARPA and that
504.81s - 509.81s |  freaked a lot of people out. And now automobile companies have entire teams dedicated to
509.81s - 514.49s |  worrying about things like that. Now if you actually just look at DEF CON alone, between
514.49s - 520.13s |  2011 and 2014, about 10% of all of the talks could be traced back to just one DARPA
520.15s - 526.65s |  program. Cyber Fast Track, what we call CFT. So I think it's no surprise when you hear that
526.65s - 532.13s |  history to think that we believe we absolutely need to continue to work with you, um, and
532.13s - 537.97s |  hear from you. It's why I'm here. So, uh, I'm gonna go back to those very first couple
537.97s - 544.41s |  letters typed into the internet, right? So L-O crash. Um, it was a memory corruption. Same
544.41s - 548.81s |  old software defect that we have been repeatedly living with. Um, why are so many of the
548.83s - 552.83s |  security vulnerabilities still found around today? Um, really just variations on the same
552.83s - 559.21s |  theme, themes. Uh, I mean code and data corruption, buffer overflows and memory manipulation,
559.21s - 563.61s |  command interjections when, uh, user input is treated as a command, um, instead of
563.61s - 568.31s |  information. And even though many exploits are exquisitely written, they're still
568.31s - 572.05s |  ultimately taking class, uh, advantage of the very same classes of software defects that
572.07s - 580.07s |  we've been living, um, with forever. So what if, uh, all of the classes of security
580.07s - 585.57s |  vulnerabilities, um, or maybe we can appropriately just call them software defects, what if
585.57s - 590.71s |  they all just disappeared tomorrow? You can suggest that that is a DARPA question and it is
590.71s - 595.29s |  one that we are working on and we would love more help in. But the question I want to ask
595.29s - 600.13s |  you is let's imagine that that happens. What's next? Cause that's really the DARPA
600.17s - 605.75s |  question. The adversary doesn't just pack up their bags and quit. Um, we will always have a
605.75s - 610.81s |  mission to complete. So maybe you are the ones with the magic idea, um, about how we can
610.81s - 616.13s |  make all the cyber vulnerabilities disappear overnight. But maybe you have also imagined
616.13s - 622.53s |  the problem we would face when all of them go away. Um, and the bottom line is I mean it
622.53s - 627.13s |  when I say that I'm really worried about what you might be imagining because if we're
627.13s - 631.97s |  not hearing about that we are completely missing out on being able to really make those
631.97s - 638.17s |  big bets and hopefully change the world. So we want you to have the opportunity, um, to
638.17s - 643.21s |  solve really big problems. We want you to be able to share your seemingly crazy ideas,
643.21s - 647.93s |  things that others have missed. Maybe because you're a seer, uh, maybe because you can
647.93s - 651.99s |  identify a problem that no one else can, you know it intimately and you can actually
651.99s - 657.83s |  envision some thread of a, of a, of an actual solution. So when you have a problem that's
657.83s - 661.77s |  hugely important to you, something that you probably had to duct tape and work around
661.77s - 666.03s |  forever to the point that you almost forget that it's there. Um, but you have a glimmer of
666.03s - 670.95s |  an idea on how to fix it. Um, there's a, there's a pretty good chance that that idea, um,
670.95s - 674.95s |  should be important to us and we need to hear from you. We know that you're likely the
674.95s - 680.51s |  best people to both identify and to help solve the problem and we want to enable you. Okay,
680.51s - 686.51s |  so if you've ever tried to work with the government before, um, I recognize that
686.51s - 692.47s |  that's not always really easy and we're easier than most, but still not necessarily
692.47s - 696.31s |  trivial. Um, so we spend a lot of our time trying to figure out how to lower those
696.31s - 700.11s |  barriers to entry and we do a lot of experimentation, not just in science and
700.11s - 705.59s |  technology, but in business. So we've demonstrated before, um, that we can make these
705.59s - 711.51s |  barriers go away. Um, and the, you know, I mentioned the cyber fast track or CFT program,
711.51s - 719.39s |  uh, who here remembers CFT? Okay. A few people, but actually for those that don't, let me
719.39s - 724.59s |  point out. So it was a two year experiment. During that time we had about 500 proposals
724.59s - 730.11s |  come from people in this community, 130 of which were accepted and funded. The program
730.11s - 735.31s |  manager is someone a lot of you, um, know or at least have heard of much. Um, he turned
735.31s - 742.83s |  around decisions on those proposals within 24 hours and within a week we had funds, um,
742.83s - 749.11s |  at the teams in order to actually start working immediately. Mudge also, um, acted as an ambassador
749.11s - 752.75s |  and he made sure that the government respected the culture of the community, um, and that
752.75s - 757.63s |  there was full transparency. After CFT, um, opened the doors to innovative partnerships
757.63s - 763.91s |  like this, DARPA actually continued to engage. And so, um, a number of years ago now we had,
763.91s - 769.59s |  uh, the cyber grand challenge also at DEF CON. And this week we are doing the semifinals
769.59s - 775.59s |  of the AI cyber challenge, AICC. And additionally, a lot more people from this community, um,
775.59s - 781.03s |  have come to DARPA or been, been working behind the scenes with DARPA. Um, so all of them
781.03s - 785.83s |  have really helped shape our ideas and in a lot of ways fundamentally shape what DARPA
785.83s - 790.27s |  is and how we go about doing our mission, you know, in a way that we wouldn't have recognized
790.27s - 796.23s |  maybe 10 or 15 years ago. So, uh, we've proved that it's possible for the government or at
796.23s - 802.95s |  least DARPA, um, to move faster than the commercial sector, uh, and to, and to, while still taking
802.95s - 808.07s |  those really big, bold transformative risks, um, that are part of our mission. So we have
808.07s - 812.75s |  continued that tradition of experimentation, lots and lots more business experimentation,
812.75s - 817.99s |  a lot of different ways to interact much more quickly and much more easily. Um, in some
817.99s - 822.07s |  ways, maybe so many different ways that that in itself has become kind of an interesting
822.07s - 827.03s |  conundrum to sort of figure out what the easiest path is. So, um, we have an organization called
827.03s - 831.03s |  DARPA Connect and if anybody is struggling with working with DARPA or you're not quite
831.03s - 836.23s |  sure where to start, um, all you have to do is, you know, search for DARPA Connect. Think
836.23s - 842.43s |  of it as a one-stop help desk. Like how do I find a program manager at DARPA? How do
842.43s - 847.19s |  I read one of their, their, their, their documents for our calls for proposal, which we try to
847.19s - 851.83s |  write as simply as possible, but which are always burdened with a whole lot of sort of
851.83s - 856.07s |  official terms and conditions that you might be a little worried about. Uh, DARPA Connect
856.07s - 860.59s |  is there to help. They, they're going to provide custom coaching to help with just about any
860.59s - 865.15s |  aspect of engaging with us or with other parts of the defense department. Because, you know,
865.15s - 868.19s |  if it's not us, there's a good chance that what you're talking about should be heard
868.19s - 872.39s |  by somebody, um, somebody else. You know, we've also got some experiments going on and
872.39s - 878.23s |  how to very rapidly get people with great ideas, um, intersecting into the classified
878.23s - 882.79s |  problem space because we have a chicken and egg problem there where defining the problem
882.79s - 886.83s |  and finding the solutions keep going past each other because you sort of have to already
886.83s - 891.83s |  have one in order to have the other. Um, so, you know, the bottom line is you absolutely
891.83s - 896.75s |  don't have to be a major defense contractor to work with us. Uh, at least 30% of our budget
896.75s - 901.95s |  goes to small, uh, to small businesses and non-traditional organizations. Um, another
901.95s - 906.71s |  20% goes to universities. We really tend to have the, the fundamental thing that we look
906.71s - 913.51s |  for is the idea. And we want to make sure that we can hear that idea as quickly as possible.
913.51s - 916.87s |  So I know we still have a lot to learn. The world is changing rapidly, um, but I think
916.87s - 920.63s |  we're moving in the right direction there. And if we're not, I want to hear from you
920.63s - 926.19s |  as to what we can be doing better. Uh, okay. So you, I say over and over again that, uh,
926.19s - 931.11s |  we want to hear your ideas. Who is this we, right? We, um, at DARPA, when I say that,
931.11s - 935.43s |  that means our program managers. DARPA is made up at any moment in time of about a hundred
935.43s - 942.39s |  program managers. They come to us from all walks of life, from this community, from companies,
942.39s - 947.91s |  from other parts of the government, from universities, from many, many different technological sectors.
947.91s - 952.59s |  And they come to DARPA because they think they can change the world. And, um, that's
952.59s - 956.71s |  a pretty deeply uncomfortable state to be in. I mean, it's a lot of responsibility.
956.71s - 959.75s |  And one of the things we find works best to DARPA is that right around the time you start
959.75s - 965.11s |  feeling comfortable, we kick you out. Um, we have a constant cycle, um, of new ideas
965.11s - 968.35s |  and new people. And so that itself can be a little intimidating. You want to talk to
968.35s - 972.71s |  a program manager, but they're, they're constantly cycling in. That's where DARPA connect can
972.71s - 977.99s |  help, um, find the program manager, tell them about your idea. Think about, you know, what
977.99s - 981.99s |  keeps you up at night, what keeps them up at night and look for those opportunities,
981.99s - 986.83s |  um, where we can then make a major investment and do something really transformative together.
986.83s - 991.31s |  Um, so when you reach out to a program manager, all you have to worry about is the problem
991.31s - 996.71s |  that you care about. Let us worry about connecting it to the bigger national security questions
996.71s - 1003.39s |  or to the rest of the government. Um, don't, don't ask them to tell you what to do, right?
1003.39s - 1007.47s |  I mean, seriously, I can't imagine that most of you would, but it does happen. You tell
1007.47s - 1013.27s |  them, um, where you think these missing opportunities and, um, and problems might be. And we really
1013.27s - 1019.51s |  can't wait to hear from you. Okay. So understandably, I'm really passionate about talking about
1019.51s - 1023.91s |  DARPA. I could probably do it all day. Um, but let's just leave it that, that DARPA is
1023.91s - 1032.15s |  pretty awesome, but, um, we are simply the original ARPA. There are actually, um, quite
1032.15s - 1036.39s |  a number of extraordinary organizations that had been arising around the country, um, and
1036.39s - 1042.35s |  around the world that follow a very similar model and the ecosystem is expanding. Um,
1042.35s - 1045.87s |  so I'm really excited that I'm going to be joined here on stage for a little fireside
1045.87s - 1051.91s |  chat by the inaugural director of one of my very favorite ARPAs, ARPA-H, ARPA for health.
1051.91s - 1055.23s |  We all care about health. So I think you're likely to be, uh, I'm interested in what she
1055.23s - 1060.51s |  has to say. And also, uh, I will be joined by much who has very recently returned to
1060.55s - 1087.36s |  DARPA as our chief information officer. So welcome Renee and much. Yeah. All right. Are
1087.36s - 1103.01s |  these, I think it's on. Yep. Oh, there we go. Okay. All right. So it turns out, you
1103.01s - 1107.33s |  know, we all know each other and we've talked to each other, you know, kind of in a, these
1107.33s - 1111.09s |  kind of bilateral conversations. We've never had a chance for the three of us to chat and
1111.09s - 1116.69s |  it turns out we have questions. Um, so we're hoping to sort of enjoy sitting in. We, we
1116.77s - 1121.49s |  are dying to learn a few things from each other. Um, and I am going to kick off with,
1121.49s - 1126.41s |  uh, something that I am sort of embarrassed that I don't really know much. Like we were
1126.41s - 1130.85s |  actually program managers, um, at the same time. I have no idea what made you take that
1130.85s - 1142.35s |  job to actually come work for DARPA. Yeah, sure. We'll just swap like that. Thanks. It's,
1142.35s - 1146.39s |  it's the sharing amongst agencies already. Tech transition in, in progress right in front
1146.39s - 1151.19s |  of your very eyes. Um, well that's a, that's an interesting one. I thought you were going
1151.19s - 1157.23s |  to ask why I, I decided to rejoin. But, but, um, the, uh, the joining. You rejoined because
1157.23s - 1163.11s |  we like overwhelmed you. We were desperate to have you back. But yeah, but the first
1163.11s - 1167.83s |  job and the first. Yeah, the, the, the first one was, um, well, I mean I had been working
1167.83s - 1173.75s |  in technology. I was doing the loft. Um, you know, I had been around folks, uh, who were
1173.75s - 1180.29s |  interacting with DARPA. There was a good academic and hacker community and program managers
1180.29s - 1187.05s |  that we kind of knew. And, um, I was also in, uh, I ended up in a government, uh, contracting,
1187.05s - 1193.51s |  uh, organization. Uh, I won't, uh, name them. And I was looking at things saying, you know,
1193.51s - 1198.69s |  we can, we can do better. Uh, I'm seeing the same ideas coming in over and over again.
1198.69s - 1202.53s |  And some of them I'm seeing are from this community, but not being presented by this
1202.53s - 1209.23s |  community and not being performed by this community. And wouldn't they be the best to
1209.23s - 1215.27s |  do the work because they know the problem, you know, most intimately. Um, and I also
1215.27s - 1220.53s |  wanted to be an ambassador. Uh, I had done this throughout the loft, uh, the first Senate
1220.53s - 1228.79s |  testimony. Um, we won't talk about, uh, many of the others. Um, and, uh, it was a bi-directional
1228.79s - 1232.75s |  one, you know, because I had a good relationship with people in the government where I was
1232.75s - 1237.95s |  like, oh, I see rays of light. I was, you know, I'm critical of a lot of, uh, the government,
1237.95s - 1244.19s |  but I also, you know, want to, uh, give kudos and encourage where I see positive actions
1244.19s - 1250.39s |  going. Um, and then I also wanted to make sure that this community wasn't viewed as
1250.39s - 1256.03s |  just like a resource to pull from. Um, but that this community that we should be a resource
1256.03s - 1262.75s |  to this community as well. Um, what I fell in love with was the fixed term. Uh, the fact
1262.75s - 1267.07s |  that it was like you were fired as soon as you were hired because you're only there for
1267.19s - 1272.79s |  four years, uh, at most. So you better sprint and the things you're dealing with are of
1272.79s - 1279.51s |  such magnitude. And if you stop sprinting, you know, you'll have wasted your time. You'll
1279.51s - 1285.11s |  have missed an opportunity to potentially have changed the world for the better. Um,
1285.11s - 1289.43s |  or you'll have missed the opportunity to take a big chance at an agency that's much more,
1289.43s - 1294.91s |  you know, risk tolerant and acceptant, uh, so that, you know, it's okay to fail. We're
1294.91s - 1300.11s |  going to learn from the failure. So that combination was just like, okay, I, I can't
1300.11s - 1304.63s |  pass this up. Let's give this a try. So that was a huge honor then. And it's a huge honor
1304.63s - 1311.67s |  to rejoin. Um, I wrote a bunch of these down cause so many people sent me in questions,
1311.67s - 1318.11s |  uh, and I wanted to make sure we, we, uh, caught some of these. So, uh, I'm not the
1318.11s - 1323.35s |  only one who was at DARPA. You were at DARPA also, you were at another, uh, ARPA that,
1323.35s - 1329.23s |  uh, I have, uh, relationships with as well. Um, two questions. I'll ask them one at a
1329.23s - 1336.23s |  time. What's, what do you view as the Delta or the differences between ARPA-H and DARPA?
1336.23s - 1342.39s |  Yeah. Oh, right. Yeah. Pass it. I'll pass it back. Um, so I love hearing your origin
1342.39s - 1347.51s |  story to becoming a program manager. And, uh, I do think that's where a lot of the similarities
1347.51s - 1352.83s |  lie. So when I became a program manager, it was also the same sense of urgency to solve
1352.83s - 1357.71s |  a problem and not having an outlet for it. And so, uh, what brought me to DARPA was,
1357.71s - 1362.67s |  was really around genome editing technologies. And this is dating myself here over a decade
1362.67s - 1367.29s |  ago where these were brand new technologies, um, that had a lot of off target effects and
1367.29s - 1371.23s |  unexpected consequences. Um, and that was the first time I came to DEF CON actually
1371.23s - 1374.79s |  was to engage with this community, thinking about DNA as a programming language and what
1374.79s - 1379.51s |  are other ways that you can be, um, preventing misuse, but creating tools to make sure we
1379.51s - 1383.55s |  can get this into the real world. And so giving this back to the people is, is, is
1383.55s - 1387.67s |  such an important part, I think, of what ARPAs do. And so when there was an opportunity to
1387.67s - 1392.51s |  come back to government and, and lead and launch the first ARPA for health, um, with
1392.51s - 1398.95s |  that spirit of adopting that, you know, DARPA bravado, but taking that model and really
1398.95s - 1404.31s |  pursuing our mission, which is to accelerate better health outcomes for everyone. So we
1404.31s - 1409.31s |  stole directly the first eight Heilmayer questions from DARPA. So this is, you know, what's the
1409.35s - 1413.23s |  problem you're trying to solve? How's it done today? What's new in your approach? And then
1413.23s - 1418.75s |  some tactics around, you know, cost, um, how long will it take and what are your milestones?
1418.75s - 1422.99s |  We've added a few questions, um, at ARPA-H. This is one of the differentiators. It's so
1422.99s - 1427.79s |  important in healthcare that we are creating tools that are cost effective, that people
1427.79s - 1433.03s |  can actually afford and that they are accessible to communities, whether it's urban, rural,
1433.03s - 1437.63s |  regardless of your demographics, but then having a customer experience in mind. And
1437.67s - 1441.75s |  so our program managers can't launch a program unless they've thought about who's the end
1441.75s - 1446.31s |  user. As a patient, we've all had negative experiences with the healthcare sector. And
1446.31s - 1452.23s |  so how would you redesign with a human centered approach, that entire process, or as a
1452.23s - 1456.55s |  doctor, um, you know, what I've learned that the OR is sacred. And if you're going to
1456.55s - 1460.87s |  introduce something into the operating room, you need that doctor as a partner, um,
1460.87s - 1465.43s |  developing those capabilities with you. And so, um, we're really trying by design to build
1465.43s - 1470.07s |  that into a lot of what we're doing, um, at ARPA-H. And, you know, Stephanie said that we
1470.07s - 1474.31s |  had, you all have about a hundred program managers. We're at about 20. Uh, we're still
1474.31s - 1478.95s |  growing. So, uh, that's also an open call to think about what are some of those big
1478.95s - 1483.71s |  problems in health, um, at the intersection of, uh, some of the cyber and, and data
1483.71s - 1486.43s |  capabilities is certainly an area that we really want to grow out.
1486.43s - 1492.11s |  I don't know where we're getting the hum or feedback from. So the second one is, I
1492.11s - 1496.79s |  understand the connection on like the biohacking village. I understand the weird
1496.79s - 1504.63s |  machines, uh, uh, Emmanuel LaFroy and, and Sergey Bratis at all. Um, and, and that
1504.63s - 1512.39s |  relationship, but this is normally a predominantly cyber, uh, conference. So ARPA-H
1512.39s - 1514.83s |  and cyber, can you give me a little elaboration there?
1516.35s - 1520.55s |  Yeah. So, you know, when, when coming back to our mission to accelerate better health
1520.59s - 1524.23s |  outcomes for everyone, people really associate health outcomes typically with
1524.39s - 1530.19s |  diagnostics or therapeutics, but actually a hospital shutting down and, uh, because
1530.19s - 1534.95s |  of a ransomware attack or whatever vulnerability may be exploited actually
1534.99s - 1539.11s |  immediately impacts patient outcomes as well. And so if we're being true to our
1539.11s - 1544.47s |  mission, we are really, um, leaning into the, the cyber capability as well. Um, but
1544.47s - 1547.71s |  this is an area where healthcare does not have a lot of strengths. We don't have the
1547.71s - 1552.27s |  workforce that a national security workforce has. Um, so we hired a program
1552.27s - 1556.39s |  manager, uh, back a little over a year ago, Andrew Carney, um, who had been really
1556.39s - 1561.11s |  thinking about programs that, that he can be moving into in this space. Um, and so
1561.11s - 1566.87s |  when Stephanie called me this spring to tell me about the AI, uh, CC challenge, um,
1566.95s - 1572.47s |  it was just such a great opportunity to play to both agencies' strengths. Um, the
1572.51s - 1576.91s |  ability of a DARPA to launch a grand challenge for our agency to learn, but also
1576.91s - 1580.95s |  operate at that intersection. Um, and really Stephanie, it, you know, I learned so
1580.95s - 1584.99s |  much in that call about the challenge, um, where it's been and where it's going. And
1584.99s - 1588.15s |  I think it'd be fun if you wanted to share some of that with the audience today.
1588.55s - 1592.99s |  Oh, sure. Yeah. So the AI cyber challenges is even for DARPA, it's been moving
1592.99s - 1597.75s |  really, really fast. So I should point out like DARPA starts 40 or 50 new DARPA
1597.75s - 1602.19s |  programs a year. Obviously a lot of them don't succeed. Um, when we're looking for
1602.19s - 1605.87s |  those really major breakthroughs, but typically our programs are around, you know,
1605.87s - 1610.31s |  we lay out a hypothesis, we lay out a goal, we call for proposals, and then we fund
1610.31s - 1615.95s |  people with the coolest and craziest ideas. But sometimes problems are, they just
1615.95s - 1619.35s |  don't lend themselves to that structure. Sometimes we need to issue a global
1619.35s - 1624.87s |  challenge. Um, and we want to have teams from all over the country, like working in
1624.87s - 1628.43s |  so many different ways. Like we don't want to over specify the solution space. Um,
1628.43s - 1631.35s |  the first time we did that was something called the DARPA grand challenge. You
1631.35s - 1635.83s |  remember I mentioned, um, our role in the, uh, on the, uh, self-driving car
1635.83s - 1639.59s |  industry. The DARPA grand challenge was all about self-driving cars and it was a
1639.59s - 1643.15s |  race. And we spent a lot of time worrying about like the finish line and how to
1643.15s - 1646.87s |  score, like who was going to, how do we know who actually won? It turns out in
1646.87s - 1651.47s |  that first year, not a single car made it across the finish line. And some of them
1651.47s - 1655.23s |  were on fire. They rolled over, all kinds of crazy stuff happened. So when I say we
1655.23s - 1658.51s |  embrace failure, we do, we do embrace failure. Um, because we went back out the
1658.51s - 1663.99s |  next year and we did it again. Um, and, and that challenge idea is sometimes the
1663.99s - 1669.59s |  right way to structure certain, certain questions. And the AICC, the AI cyber
1669.59s - 1673.91s |  challenge kind of grew around the confluence, a couple of different
1673.91s - 1678.43s |  questions. Um, one was, you know, we were, we were like everybody else. We were
1678.43s - 1683.83s |  looking at this wave of large language models, um, and dominating the
1683.83s - 1687.23s |  conversation. And a lot of the conversation was like all of the terrible
1687.23s - 1691.11s |  things that could happen. And so part of what we wanted to ask is the classic
1691.11s - 1695.39s |  contrarian question. It's like, how do you harness them in ways that we have some
1695.39s - 1699.27s |  confidence in the outcomes for good? And what can we do as quickly as possible?
1699.27s - 1703.63s |  Because we also want to learn. Um, we were having some conversations with people
1703.63s - 1707.15s |  about fundamental national security vulnerabilities. And one was actually a
1707.15s - 1711.75s |  conversation with Ann Neuberger, who was just up here about infrastructure and
1711.75s - 1716.19s |  all of the software vulnerabilities there. So now here's another thing about
1716.39s - 1721.35s |  DARPA. We do not tell our program managers what programs to run. We hire
1721.35s - 1727.47s |  them and they come and tell us what needs to happen. What I can do sometimes
1727.47s - 1732.99s |  is throw out into the atmosphere of DARPA a question and say, if anyone has
1732.99s - 1737.59s |  ideas, this could be really important. And so we threw this question out there,
1737.61s - 1741.83s |  large language models, national infrastructure, lots of looming national
1741.83s - 1746.95s |  security questions. Um, and one of our program managers, Perry Adams, came in
1746.99s - 1750.71s |  like within a couple of weeks and she's like, I got an idea, but we need to do a
1750.71s - 1754.43s |  challenge. We need to do this thing where we're actually looking at harnessing
1754.43s - 1758.67s |  the large language models and finding and repairing vulnerabilities in national
1758.71s - 1764.51s |  national infrastructure as quickly as possible. Um, okay. Maybe unsurprising
1764.51s - 1768.79s |  given the level of talent among our program managers. Um, less than a year
1768.79s - 1771.79s |  after she, so, so actually a couple of months after she had the idea, she was
1771.79s - 1775.83s |  here at DEF CON announcing the kickoff. So that was one year ago. And then not
1775.83s - 1779.51s |  too many months after that, she got, got pulled in by other parts of the national
1779.51s - 1783.35s |  security community, sort of by name. She needed, she was needed for a bigger
1783.35s - 1788.23s |  mission. So we had to find someone else equally amazing. And that was Andrew
1788.23s - 1793.07s |  Carney. And then I, and he worked for an A. Um, so we said, is it, is it actually
1793.11s - 1797.23s |  like against the law for us to share an amazing program manager? And the more we
1797.23s - 1800.23s |  talked about it, the more we talked about the fact that the infrastructure
1800.23s - 1804.71s |  question is one that hits almost every community from one direction or another.
1804.87s - 1808.47s |  So Renee talked about the healthcare side of it. And we have also been talking
1808.47s - 1814.07s |  to our counterparts at ARPA for energy about the power grid or ARPA for, for
1814.31s - 1816.59s |  infrastructure within the department of transportation.
1823.41s - 1826.33s |  I feel like I'm at a Cuban embassy. Bad joke.
1830.35s - 1832.19s |  Okay. We can all still breathe. This is good.
1832.39s - 1838.07s |  So anyway, we, so the AICC challenge. So Andrew took over. He's been awesome. Um,
1838.19s - 1842.03s |  the, the semifinals are, are sort of underway at this moment. We've had some
1842.03s - 1846.47s |  amazing teams. I suspect some of you were out here in the audience. Thank you, uh,
1846.47s - 1850.79s |  for, for putting you are all into, uh, into that challenge. And, and I have no
1850.79s - 1854.31s |  idea where the results are. I am dying, uh, to see, and we're really looking
1854.31s - 1860.79s |  forward to, to hearing that. But that's the, that's the AICC story. Um, and
1860.91s - 1864.11s |  uh, I think that's the, does that cover what you're, you were looking for? I
1864.11s - 1867.03s |  think it's sort of why this community, I think that's kind of obvious, right?
1867.87s - 1874.23s |  So, um, that actually, you know, we've talked about many, many intersections in
1874.23s - 1878.51s |  this community, um, and the ARPAs. Uh, and, and I think maybe one of the people
1878.51s - 1882.15s |  who can best answer my next question, you know, Mudge is you, what advice would
1882.15s - 1886.07s |  you give, uh, to members of this community on working with organizations
1886.27s - 1890.67s |  like ours? Um, so I, I, I don't know how many of you out there, uh, remember
1890.67s - 1896.03s |  the loft. Uh, I know that most of the really technical folks are over at H.D.
1896.03s - 1901.03s |  Moore's SSH, uh, talk right now. But when I was running the loft, which was this
1901.03s - 1906.03s |  very early, what we like to call ourselves hacker think tank. Um, uh, but
1906.03s - 1908.95s |  that was the Senate testimony of shutting the internet down in 30 minutes
1908.95s - 1913.95s |  using the internet. And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
1913.99s - 1916.19s |  and the other Senate testimony of shutting the internet down in 30 minutes
1916.19s - 1921.19s |  using BGP attacks. Um, was we had all of these ideas and solutions and thought
1922.63s - 1928.51s |  they were really critical, but we looked at places to like figure out we only needed
1928.51s - 1932.01s |  a small amount of funding, you know, in order to do this and there were too many
1932.01s - 1936.27s |  barriers to do it. Um, and that was again back towards the question of why
1936.27s - 1941.85s |  did I join ARPAs? I wanted to remove some of those barriers. And actually a lot
1941.85s - 1947.37s |  of the barriers weren't as big as I thought. And so the advice that I could
1947.37s - 1953.49s |  give to anybody who wants to work on a problem is first off don't try and go in
1953.49s - 1958.53s |  and solve like a government problem. Bring a problem that you're passionate
1958.53s - 1964.21s |  about in your community and it's not just your idea that you know we're
1964.21s - 1969.03s |  looking for. You're probably the one that's been obsessing about it, knows the
1969.03s - 1974.15s |  most nuances about it, have thought about it the most that you've probably got one
1974.15s - 1978.19s |  of the better shots at the solution and you're probably one of the you know the
1978.19s - 1986.31s |  best options to actually perform on it. So how do you you know cross that chasm?
1986.31s - 1994.79s |  You know the first one is the PMs. So as Stephanie mentioned we don't tell the
1994.79s - 1999.31s |  PMs what to do. You know they come in with a general idea or a bunch of ideas.
1999.31s - 2004.27s |  Call them up. They're on the web page. You know they're public servants. We're
2004.27s - 2008.35s |  all public servants up here. Get 30 minutes or 60 minutes of their time if
2008.35s - 2014.07s |  they if they can through the through one of their assistants or schedulers and
2014.07s - 2019.11s |  don't ask you know tell them here's the thing that's been driving me nuts that's
2019.11s - 2024.03s |  been eating our lunch in our community for so long. Here's you know how I
2024.03s - 2029.51s |  quantify why this is just like bleeding us dry and the solutions in place
2029.51s - 2035.95s |  aren't going to converge and here's you know here's my crazy idea with some data
2035.95s - 2040.91s |  points showing that now and with the you know current technology you know might
2040.91s - 2045.99s |  be the right time to do it. And then the other one is when you go to those what
2045.99s - 2049.07s |  they're called broad agency announcements the BAA's what Stephanie
2049.07s - 2053.31s |  was referencing which you know it's a few pages of what you know maybe
2053.31s - 2059.67s |  somebody's looking for and then like a whole bunch of government ease you know
2059.67s - 2067.79s |  you can you can look through those find those five pages use connect and it's
2067.79s - 2072.87s |  not as difficult as possible. If it is difficult or are some of the new ways
2072.87s - 2078.71s |  we've lifted from what we learned from CFT from what we've learned from RFT the
2078.75s - 2083.71s |  different fast tracks and everything and you're still getting stuck somewhere
2083.71s - 2088.63s |  because you can't fly across country to go to an industry day or there's not an
2088.63s - 2093.11s |  announcement from a PM that's directly in line with your idea that doesn't
2093.11s - 2098.11s |  matter tell us where you get stuck tell us what barrier it is how far you went
2098.11s - 2105.55s |  tell us some ideas on how to remove it because we actually have more ability
2105.55s - 2111.55s |  and just might not know that that's a barrier precluding a lot of people from
2111.55s - 2118.43s |  participating and and playing and then the last part is if it's not already
2118.43s - 2122.99s |  some like oh here's an announcement of a program that came out and my thing
2122.99s - 2127.27s |  doesn't really fit in it call the PM's anyway there are these things called
2127.27s - 2133.39s |  office BAA's which are for a whole bunch of other ideas and when you're talking
2133.55s - 2138.31s |  to the PM the PM's aren't allowed to say like oh yes you know this is what I want
2138.31s - 2144.47s |  or yes I will fund your idea or anything thinking everything has to be very equal
2144.47s - 2149.19s |  very open very fair but you can listen for some words that might give you a
2149.19s - 2153.43s |  hint that they're interested such as you know if you wanted to you know spend
2153.43s - 2157.55s |  some time and propose or write up something I'd be interested you know I'd
2157.55s - 2161.79s |  have the interest to read that and consider it you know and look at it so
2161.79s - 2165.71s |  you know if you hear something like that that probably means you have an
2165.71s - 2170.35s |  aligned PM and you know go for it if you hear somebody saying like that doesn't
2170.35s - 2174.55s |  really fit in with what I'm doing you know then maybe you know you couldn't
2174.55s - 2178.07s |  you know look for the next PM or look for the next area so there aren't as
2178.07s - 2182.59s |  many barriers as possible we're trying to remove as many make use of the PM's
2182.59s - 2188.11s |  call tell us where we can do better and make sure it's solving something that
2188.11s - 2193.19s |  matters to you and gives back to your community and your interest we'll figure
2193.19s - 2197.55s |  out if it's something that the DOD has also they will have that problem also
2197.55s - 2201.19s |  even if they don't know about it and that's where DARPA comes into play but
2201.19s - 2206.95s |  we should be a resource to the community and you know any parts of the government
2206.95s - 2211.15s |  shouldn't be in my personal opinion going around and just take take take
2211.15s - 2214.03s |  this looks like a neat community take take take you know what ideas do you
2214.03s - 2217.79s |  have for us it should be bi-directional and it should be in the areas that are
2217.79s - 2223.63s |  naturally aligned neither group trying to change the other into you know a mold
2223.63s - 2228.59s |  of what it expects it to be stay who you are I don't want you to change I want
2228.59s - 2232.31s |  you to keep growing in the direction that you're already growing and the same
2232.31s - 2235.79s |  way you know I do you know there are plenty of ways for the government to
2235.79s - 2240.51s |  change but that's not the game that we're playing right here you know I
2240.51s - 2244.43s |  think you might you really highlight a lot of the roles that a PM has and
2244.43s - 2249.07s |  finding that PM champion is such a key part of I think being successful at an
2249.07s - 2253.91s |  ARPA but one of the roles of a PM is is often to coach the community I've
2253.91s - 2258.43s |  learned over time so how should you be thinking about the problem at ARPA-H a
2258.43s - 2262.75s |  lot of people don't know what even DARPA is and in the healthcare sector so it's
2262.75s - 2266.79s |  having folks think about what does that future look like 10 15 years from now
2266.79s - 2271.39s |  and how should you be thinking about that problem for us we don't have the
2271.39s - 2274.99s |  Department of Defense as our ultimate second buyer we're we're almost
2274.99s - 2278.75s |  exclusively reliant on industry so we have it we have a different challenge at
2278.75s - 2282.51s |  ARPA-H but we have to help industry think about where we should be going and
2282.51s - 2287.15s |  so from your perspective where should how should industry be thinking about
2287.15s - 2291.51s |  cyber and in general where are we going and and how should they be thinking
2291.51s - 2299.35s |  about the path that we're on so and I'm gonna have a similar one back to you for
2299.35s - 2303.71s |  industry I think industry you know this is gonna be much and this is gonna be
2303.71s - 2307.35s |  the whole like well it's why we hired him we knew he'd go off the rails at
2307.35s - 2312.31s |  some point I think the industry is perfectly happy in this perverse steady
2312.31s - 2317.17s |  state situation where we are because you know the the vulnerabilities we keep
2317.17s - 2320.99s |  writing vulnerabilities faster than we can fix them it's not so much that the
2320.99s - 2325.59s |  adversary has gotten so amazing it's that you know like wow well we're
2325.59s - 2329.79s |  producing software more and more rapidly and with the same classes of
2329.79s - 2333.95s |  vulnerabilities over and over and over again so there's not an incentive
2333.95s - 2338.87s |  structure really in place for them to you know go change something if they're
2338.87s - 2344.11s |  not the one owning the cost of fixing it that's us the customers or the end users
2344.11s - 2348.51s |  but it is someplace where like if DARPA went in and magically made everything go
2348.51s - 2353.91s |  away you know I'd be fascinated to say like okay hey why are we throwing all
2353.99s - 2358.99s |  those crashes that we can't turn into RCEs in our fuzzing on the ground it
2358.99s - 2363.91s |  could be that they're actually even more valuable than remote code because if the
2363.91s - 2368.19s |  system turns off at just the right time it can turn back on without leaving
2368.19s - 2373.51s |  permanent damage isn't that kind of one like the the dreams of cyber that like
2373.51s - 2376.87s |  you know you look at look at a drone I don't care about taking over the drone I
2376.87s - 2380.43s |  just would rather it not drop something bad on me right now so let's turn that
2380.43s - 2386.55s |  thing off or you know if I wanted to look at all of the software as a service
2386.55s - 2391.59s |  look at all of AWS or GCE or anything else it's a systems of systems of
2391.59s - 2397.39s |  systems with wild layers of redundancy in different ways and upsetting one part
2397.39s - 2401.95s |  of the system causes it to reroute and change in different ways that might be
2401.95s - 2408.23s |  invisible to the end user but might be very advantageous to either a defender
2408.23s - 2414.47s |  or an attacker so it's this what is the larger system is it side channels is it
2414.47s - 2418.91s |  the fact that it moves into a different realm are you looking at it from like
2418.91s - 2423.07s |  two layers higher than you ever thought of before or are you looking at it three
2423.07s - 2428.83s |  layers lower because your phone has like 35 different CPUs and operating systems
2428.83s - 2434.67s |  and shells inside of it etc so what happens if you know the adversary gets a
2434.67s - 2439.59s |  turn and why don't we figure out that turn first and like you know let's box
2439.59s - 2451.39s |  them in so my final question to the two of you is you're both in charge of
2451.39s - 2459.51s |  agencies with really broad mandates well I'll just say broad areas of interest
2459.67s - 2470.91s |  and execution and challenges two parts to this question one even how broad they
2470.91s - 2475.51s |  are what's something further outside of that realm that you're like this is
2475.51s - 2478.83s |  relevant and we should probably be considering that this might be within
2478.83s - 2486.27s |  our domain and then two if it was just you Stephanie or Renee I get to call her
2486.27s - 2493.67s |  Stephanie as opposed to you Tyro or dr. Tom I'm gonna beat that out of you at
2493.67s - 2501.03s |  some point oh yeah yeah is a what is it you personally if there were no
2501.03s - 2506.79s |  boundaries is something that you're just like I would love to entertain or go
2506.79s - 2512.83s |  after this particular you know bizarre problem that nobody else seems to see
2512.83s - 2522.25s |  but I see it coming around the corner so maybe back to where we started on DNA
2522.25s - 2526.57s |  as a programming language so if we look 10 or 15 years from now we don't have a
2526.57s - 2530.65s |  program on this I would love to find somebody excited about this but you know
2530.65s - 2534.61s |  thinking about large language models every gene has a beginning a middle and
2534.61s - 2538.17s |  an end there's contacts to those sentences there's predictions we can do
2538.17s - 2544.01s |  and we don't have a lot of control of that biological domain we're through
2544.01s - 2547.33s |  gene editing through other genetic therapies we're just starting to do
2547.33s - 2551.73s |  create the tools that that we can control and manipulate genes we can
2551.73s - 2556.69s |  measure genes at scale and to do so in a cost-effective manner but how are we
2556.69s - 2560.29s |  thinking about predicting that obviously for good but at the same time you know
2560.29s - 2565.81s |  preventing malicious use of those technologies and I am so excited we have
2565.81s - 2569.41s |  some little investments at our page looking at this now we have a program
2569.41s - 2573.45s |  called apex that's focused on using generative AI to create you know new to
2573.45s - 2578.17s |  this Earth's sequences that could be antigens to take all the other viruses
2578.17s - 2582.17s |  that we don't yet have vaccines for off the table or to create you know new
2582.17s - 2586.01s |  sequences to make new medicines and diagnostics and so I'm really excited to
2586.01s - 2590.85s |  unlock that moving forward I'd love to hear what you are focused on Stephanie
2590.85s - 2596.21s |  well I mean I'll take the bait I'll ask your second question first I mean if it
2596.21s - 2600.05s |  was just me I would be working on supply chain challenges my training I'm
2600.05s - 2603.85s |  actually a geologist I know where the raw materials come from I know where
2603.85s - 2606.77s |  they don't come from and I know all of the vulnerabilities in that really
2606.77s - 2610.89s |  complex system that the world depends on but you know what there's a whole point
2610.89s - 2615.13s |  about DARPA and ARPA is it actually like what I think is really exciting isn't
2615.13s - 2617.49s |  that important it's what our program managers tell us it's what the
2617.49s - 2621.81s |  communities are telling us an example of one that I'm particularly fascinated
2621.81s - 2625.65s |  right now actually has to do with the future of quantum computing it is still
2625.65s - 2629.13s |  pretty much on the knife's edge as to whether this is going to be one of the
2629.13s - 2635.61s |  most transformative things for humanity ever or utterly useless and while lots
2635.61s - 2639.05s |  of people are working on quantum computing not a lot of people are asking
2639.05s - 2643.65s |  those hard questions as to how we will actually know which side of the fence
2643.65s - 2647.97s |  the technology is going to fall so we're really trying to address that kind of
2647.97s - 2653.05s |  question and the bottom line is that there is no shortage of massively hard
2653.05s - 2657.29s |  problems to solve and amazing technological opportunities so I am very
2657.29s - 2661.05s |  cleverly going to bring this back to our original point which is the ideas
2661.05s - 2665.81s |  are going to come from people like you and we really hope that you aren't shy
2665.81s - 2670.89s |  about telling us what you think they are so and how to solve them exactly yeah
2670.89s - 2679.21s |  with your ideas and you as the performer hopefully 32 seconds to spare so thank
2679.21s - 2683.21s |  you again for your time and your attention thanks everybody
