**Presentation Agenda**
- **Introduction:** Cloud Red Teaming and services for stealth evasion
- **Focus:** AWS and GCP environments
- **Discussion Points:** Defensive strategies, access control mechanisms, case study

**Techniques and Strategies**
- **Cloud Red Teaming:** Simulating real-world attacks to test security defenses
- **Stealth Evasion Techniques:** Long-hanging fruits and key services like AWS Cloud Trail, IAM API calls
- **AWS Techniques:** Put event selectors, stop log API, and roles misuse
- **GCP Techniques:** Service account impersonation through IAM roles

**Defense Strategies**
- **Service Control Policies:** Restrict API call abuses
- **IAM Standardization:** Standard procedures for identity and access management
- **AWS Permission Boundaries:** Define maximum permissions for roles and users
- **Service Account Segmentation:** Implement least privilege principle
- **Purple Teaming:** Combined efforts of red and blue teams to improve security posture

**Case Study**
- **Scenario:** Multi-cloud attack from AWS to GCP
- **Initial Access:** Exploitation through a DLP server on AWS
- **Attack Execution:** Abuse of cloud trial APIs and role impersonation
- **Outcome:** Compromise of production environments, undetected exfiltration

**Conclusion**
- **Importance:** Proper configuration of SIEM, service segmentation, and defensive policies
- **Objective:** Ensure business continuity and enhance security measures through realistic attack simulations
