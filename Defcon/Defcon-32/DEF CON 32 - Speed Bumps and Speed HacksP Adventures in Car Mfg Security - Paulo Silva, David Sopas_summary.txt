**Introduction**
- Talk by Paulo Silva and David Sopas on car manufacturer's security.
- Focus on **web applications** and **API vulnerabilities**.
- Aim to demonstrate security issues and the importance of **responsible disclosure**.

**Researchers' Background**
- **Paulo Silva**: Security researcher with a background in software development.
- **David Sopas**: Long-time security researcher focusing on **open testing** and **API security**.

**Vulnerabilities in Car Manufacturers**
- Modern **web applications** are affected by traditional vulnerabilities.
- Security issues can be chained to build real attacks.
- Common issue: Running unpatched **third-party software**.

**API Security Issues**
- Various **API architectures**: REST, GraphQL, RPC.
- Vulnerabilities often found in **Swagger** and other **open API** tools.
- **Cross-site scripting** (XSS) and outdated components are prevalent.

**Exploiting Vulnerabilities**
- Demonstration of exploiting outdated WordPress plugins.
- Importance of keeping **third-party software** updated.
- Use of subdomain enumeration and **WPScan** for vulnerability detection.

**Information Disclosure**
- Ability to add cars to dashboards without user confirmation.
- Accessing sensitive information like **VIN numbers**, **tire pressure**, and **battery status**.

**Impact of Vulnerabilities**
- Ability to track vehicles and access **PII** (Personally Identifiable Information).
- Potential for **subdomain takeover** and **phishing attacks**.
- Importance of demonstrating impact to get vulnerabilities fixed.

**Responsible Disclosure**
- All vulnerabilities reported to manufacturers.
- Emphasis on **responsible disclosure** programs.

**Conclusion**
- Importance of monitoring **subdomains** and **third-party software**.
- Encouragement to check for **Swagger UI** vulnerabilities.
- Reminder for organizations to subscribe to vulnerability databases and engage in security practices.
