**NTLM Phase-Out and Vulnerabilities**

- **NTLM**: New Technology Lan Manager, an authentication protocol Microsoft plans to phase out in Windows 11 and beyond
- **History and Usage**: Developed in the 1990s, succeeded by LM; intended to provide authentication, integrity, and confidentiality
- **Issues**: Numerous vulnerabilities and CVEs; recommended discontinuation since 2010, yet still widely used
- **Deprecation Plan**: Microsoft aims to phase out NTLM over 50-100 years; plans to use Kerberos primarily, with NTLM as a fallback
- **Security Concerns**: Windows' tendency to authenticate widely; NTLM's vulnerability to attacks and hash leakage

**Security Research and Findings**

- **Research Techniques**: Focus on NTLM vulnerabilities, leveraging responder tools, and exploring software ecosystems
- **Responder Tool**: Used to collect authentication challenges on ports 80 and 445
- **Software Vulnerabilities**: Exploiting NTLM in applications like VLC, ArcGIS, ImageMagick, and various document processing software
- **Exploits**: Techniques involve SSRF, NTLM hash leakage, and file inclusion vulnerabilities
- **Bug Discovery**: Quick identification of bugs through online searches and testing software behavior

**Microsoft Ecosystem and NTLM**

- **Microsoft's Security Controls**: Includes mark of the web and safe zones to mitigate threats
- **NTLM in Microsoft Products**: Exploitation through URI handlers, Visual Studio, and credential management
- **Vulnerabilities in Outlook**: Exploiting URI schemes and headers to bypass warnings and expose hashes
- **Security Communications**: Challenges in reporting and getting acknowledgment for vulnerabilities from Microsoft

**Future and Recommendations**

- **Continued Research**: Encouragement for ongoing disclosure and exploration of NTLM vulnerabilities
- **Community Engagement**: Inviting collaboration and sharing of insights and techniques
- **Security Practices**: Recommendations to disable NTLM, use Kerberos, and continuously assess software for vulnerabilities

**Conclusion**

- **DEF CON Participation**: Acknowledgment of the importance of community and shared research in advancing security
- **Call to Action**: Encouragement to continue research, disclosure, and engagement with the security community for better practices and improvements.
