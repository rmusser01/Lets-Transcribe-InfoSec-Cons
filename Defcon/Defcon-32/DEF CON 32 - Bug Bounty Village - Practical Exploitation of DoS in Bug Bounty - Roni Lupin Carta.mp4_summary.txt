**Introduction to Speaker and Topic**
- Roni Lupin Carta introduces himself
- Discusses **practical exploitation** in **denial of service** (DoS) within **bug bounty** programs

**Denial of Service (DoS) vs. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Single machine attack
- **DDoS**: **Distributed** attack using multiple machines
- Goal: Maximize **business impact**, e.g., halting website traffic

**Impact and Debate on DoS**
- DoS categorized under **availability** or **integrity impact**
- Not a **vulnerability class** but an **impact**
- **CVSS documentation**: Deletion of resource is **integrity**, not **availability**

**Relevance and Scope of DoS in Bug Bounty**
- Relevant for features with **strong dependencies**
- Often marked **out of scope** in bug bounty platforms like **HackerOne**
- Companies avoid DoS due to potential high impact

**Responsible Testing of DoS**
- Find program-specific **gadgets** for exploitation
- Test on **non-production environments** when allowed
- Always **inform programs** of intended DoS testing

**Network-Based Denial of Services**
- **Slow low-risk attack**: Hang packets at network level
- Example: Create **infinite redirect loops** to timeout servers
- Successful transformation of **blind SSRF** to critical vulnerability

**GraphQL Denial of Services**
- **Circular definitions**: Objects referencing themselves
- **GraphQL batching**: Combine multiple requests in one
- **GraphQL directive overloading**: Repeat directives to crash servers

**Cache Poisoning**
- Exploit web caching vulnerabilities
- Example: Manipulating cache keys to **deny package access**

**GraphQL Techniques**
- **Batching and Aliases**: Multiple requests or arguments
- **GraphQL Directives**: Decorate schema parts, potential for overload
- **WebSockets**: Often lack **WAF**, increasing attack surface

**Conclusion and Results**
- Research spanned over **eight months** with significant bounty rewards
- Total bounty: **$150,000**
- Use DoS as a **side strategy** for bug hunting

**Acknowledgements and Final Thoughts**
- Shoutout to collaborators and graphical designer
- Invitation for questions and further discussion
