 Hey, everyone.
1.48s - 3.16s |  Good morning.
3.16s - 5.20s |  Morning, DEF CON.
5.20s - 6.80s |  Good morning.
6.80s - 7.80s |  Just come on.
7.80s - 11.80s |  I flew like 20 hours from India to Las Vegas.
11.80s - 12.60s |  Come on.
12.60s - 15.68s |  Good morning, DEF CON.
15.68s - 17.44s |  Now we got it.
17.44s - 19.64s |  So we have an amazing panel here.
19.64s - 23.20s |  My name is Abhijit Babirajan Renuga.
23.20s - 24.80s |  I know how that sounds.
24.80s - 28.16s |  So I call myself ABX, much, much shorter,
28.24s - 31.52s |  so that the people will not be ruining my night, right?
31.52s - 33.16s |  So I used to be called many things,
33.16s - 36.48s |  but ABX is kind of very, very simple.
36.48s - 40.00s |  I manage, I lead the advocacy village at DEF CON
40.00s - 42.80s |  for the past, like, 45 years, right?
42.80s - 44.32s |  So we are all there.
44.32s - 46.36s |  After this panel, maybe you can come there,
46.36s - 48.00s |  listen to the talks, workshops, all this stuff,
48.00s - 50.12s |  amazing stuff happening in there.
50.12s - 53.68s |  And I'm handing over the mic to the amazing panel here.
53.68s - 55.24s |  They will introduce themselves,
55.24s - 59.52s |  and we can start insulting each other.
60.52s - 61.92s |  I'll go.
61.92s - 64.52s |  I'm What's-His-Face, Adam Pennington.
64.52s - 67.56s |  I'm with a nonprofit called the MITRE Corporation,
67.56s - 71.08s |  where I run a cybersecurity framework called MITRE ATT&CK.
71.08s - 73.80s |  I've been with MITRE a long, long time at this point.
73.80s - 75.48s |  I helped gather a lot of the data
75.48s - 77.64s |  that we used to originally create ATT&CK
77.64s - 81.04s |  through a series of honeypots with state actors.
81.04s - 86.11s |  And so I've been watching this space for a pretty long time.
86.11s - 87.95s |  Hi, I'm Stryker.
87.95s - 90.79s |  I am the head of security communications and planning
91.75s - 95.51s |  and, yes, that acronym was on purpose.
95.51s - 97.11s |  With the Adversary Pursuit Group,
97.11s - 99.63s |  that's the Threat Intel and Threat Research Unit
99.63s - 101.47s |  within Blackpoint Cyber.
101.47s - 103.79s |  We're an MDR, which means that we actually get
103.79s - 108.71s |  a lot of information from both the feedback.
108.71s - 111.43s |  We get a lot of information from both end-user environments,
111.43s - 113.71s |  from a wide range of clients,
113.71s - 116.39s |  from healthcare and critical infrastructure,
116.39s - 119.23s |  all the way through your service-based industries
119.23s - 121.51s |  and your local mom-and-pop shop.
121.51s - 124.75s |  And so we get both the supply chain moments
124.75s - 126.83s |  of them attacking directly the MSPs
126.83s - 128.11s |  and then our end clients,
128.11s - 131.55s |  which leads to some really interesting research and intel
131.55s - 132.75s |  that our teams have been working on.
132.75s - 134.67s |  So looking forward to sharing that.
134.67s - 137.47s |  Oh, also, if you're gonna pitch the Adversary Village,
137.47s - 140.11s |  come visit later at the Lonely Hackers Club.
140.11s - 141.15s |  I am an admin.
141.15s - 142.43s |  It's lots of fun.
142.43s - 144.03s |  And then the XR Village, so.
150.28s - 155.32s |  I'm the guy that can't work a microphone.
155.32s - 156.16s |  My name's Ken.
156.16s - 159.16s |  I'm the VP of AI for Omni Federal.
159.16s - 160.08s |  Previous to that role,
160.08s - 162.48s |  I was a White House Presidential Innovation Fellow
162.48s - 163.32s |  for four years,
163.32s - 166.56s |  where I got to see some pretty interesting fun attacks,
166.56s - 169.40s |  and I'm looking forward to sharing some of those experiences
169.40s - 170.36s |  with you all today.
172.00s - 172.92s |  Hi, everyone.
172.92s - 174.44s |  I'm Nikhil Mittal.
174.44s - 176.00s |  I'm the founder of Altered Security.
176.00s - 178.48s |  We are a small organization
178.48s - 180.60s |  that train people in red teaming,
180.60s - 182.36s |  on-prem, Azure, et cetera.
182.36s - 185.20s |  So we expect some stuff on Microsoft from me.
185.20s - 186.88s |  I'm pretty interested in that.
188.76s - 191.12s |  Now that the introductions are over,
191.12s - 193.76s |  I'm going to start from the right end with Adam.
193.76s - 196.00s |  So like I mentioned, the panel topic,
196.00s - 199.28s |  it's about the formidable adversaries and threat actor.
199.28s - 203.36s |  So I think Adam has a long experience on identifying
203.36s - 206.24s |  and putting these threat actors in the light.
207.24s - 211.00s |  Yeah, so ATT&CK tracks publicly available
211.00s - 212.88s |  threat intelligence information
212.88s - 214.76s |  on lots of different adversary groups.
214.76s - 216.32s |  And we've been doing that since our creation
216.32s - 219.32s |  back in 2013 to 2015.
219.32s - 220.84s |  And so everything I'm going to be talking about
220.84s - 222.48s |  is coming from publicly available
222.48s - 224.92s |  open source intelligence sources.
224.92s - 227.96s |  But state hackers are not a new thing.
227.96s - 229.92s |  We've known about it for a long time.
229.92s - 231.56s |  It's been going on for a while.
231.56s - 234.12s |  It's been in the public eye for a pretty long time too,
234.16s - 237.48s |  back to the cuckoo's nest in the 80s,
237.48s - 241.24s |  which MITRE had a role in, not a terrific one.
241.24s - 245.32s |  But, and so it's been something that has been out there.
245.32s - 248.92s |  We saw a lot more awareness coming with the APT1 report
248.92s - 252.04s |  and then Russian hacking with the elections.
252.04s - 253.96s |  And so we've seen a lot of these waves
253.96s - 256.28s |  in North Korean ransomware.
256.28s - 259.24s |  And more recently, we've seen a lot of activity
259.24s - 261.68s |  where China's become prevalent again,
261.72s - 263.96s |  where we're seeing sophisticated activity
263.96s - 266.36s |  happening across a lot of organizations,
266.36s - 269.32s |  some successful activity.
269.32s - 272.32s |  And so we're seeing trends in a lot of these spaces.
272.32s - 275.12s |  I flinch a little bit at the word sophisticated.
275.12s - 277.20s |  I know it was in the panel description,
277.20s - 281.76s |  but most threat actors are exactly as sophisticated
281.76s - 284.32s |  as they need to be in a given situation.
284.32s - 287.92s |  If they're any good, they're not usually pulling out
287.92s - 290.80s |  sort of the big guns unless they have to.
290.84s - 292.92s |  But in places where we've been seeing
292.92s - 294.72s |  the defenses get a lot better,
294.72s - 296.92s |  people are watching their networks,
296.92s - 298.84s |  people watching their end systems,
298.84s - 300.44s |  and it's gotten a lot harder
300.44s - 302.76s |  to work your way through a network.
302.76s - 305.76s |  Those of you who are red teamers probably know this too,
305.76s - 307.52s |  that the space has gotten harder.
307.52s - 309.92s |  And so we've seen adversaries
309.92s - 312.40s |  who are interested in not getting caught
312.40s - 314.60s |  and sometimes ransomware, not so much,
314.60s - 318.56s |  but a state actor that wants to steal information
318.56s - 322.24s |  and be in a network for months or years
322.24s - 325.72s |  needs to not get caught or not get completely caught
325.72s - 328.32s |  in order to meet their goals.
328.32s - 331.28s |  And so we're seeing more and more of a trend
331.28s - 335.04s |  of adversaries getting into places that we don't watch.
335.88s - 337.72s |  And so it's a natural place to be.
337.72s - 340.80s |  It's nothing that we didn't know was possible.
340.80s - 343.44s |  It's not incredibly surprising,
343.44s - 345.40s |  but adversaries getting into routers.
345.40s - 348.20s |  We saw a lot of reporting on routers last year.
348.80s - 350.04s |  And system security devices.
350.04s - 353.00s |  So finding a lot of zero days in the devices
353.00s - 355.44s |  that we actually bought to protect our networks,
355.44s - 358.52s |  getting into those and using those as pivot points
358.52s - 362.68s |  has been a popular trend to get into VMware ESX servers.
362.68s - 366.92s |  So getting into places where we can't run an ADR,
366.92s - 370.00s |  they're not supported, we don't know how to see there.
370.00s - 372.80s |  And so you're more and more buried into the system.
372.80s - 374.12s |  We've also seen a trend lately
374.12s - 376.84s |  with adversaries getting into security cameras.
376.84s - 381.00s |  And so crappy Linux devices that we have no security on
381.00s - 383.32s |  have no way of adding security to.
383.32s - 385.56s |  And so we're gonna have to be looking at some other places
385.56s - 390.98s |  to actually spot this activity.
390.98s - 393.34s |  That actually reflects a lot of what we've been seeing
393.34s - 395.62s |  in the wild with a lot of our different client bases,
395.62s - 397.18s |  to be honest.
397.18s - 401.22s |  I would say that in addition to some of the really neat
401.22s - 403.86s |  hackery kind of almost admirable things
403.86s - 408.06s |  and sophisticated, maybe less just clever,
408.06s - 410.94s |  unexpected ways that nation state level
410.94s - 412.38s |  threat actors are using,
412.38s - 415.54s |  they do make their way down into the pipeline.
415.54s - 417.94s |  There is a whole undercurrent on the dark web
417.94s - 420.54s |  of people selling everything from malware
420.54s - 422.82s |  and ransomware to initial access
422.82s - 424.18s |  and even phishing as a service.
424.18s - 427.06s |  I have seen extremely sophisticated UI
427.06s - 429.78s |  that look like HubSpot or Salesforce
429.78s - 432.34s |  is gonna send you an email like no before,
432.34s - 435.34s |  but for bad guys, it's pretty sophisticated.
435.34s - 437.62s |  So the tactics and techniques that we're seeing
438.18s - 439.62s |  at the APT level eventually do trickle down
439.62s - 443.02s |  to the script kitties who are just spamming out things
443.02s - 446.74s |  to all of the different organizations at the same time.
446.74s - 450.74s |  And one of the things to add to that is going to be,
450.74s - 454.30s |  we're seeing a lot more of living off the land tactics.
455.42s - 458.98s |  People who are using and abusing either red team tools
458.98s - 462.30s |  that were developed explicitly for research,
462.30s - 464.42s |  impact it, et cetera,
464.42s - 468.10s |  or they're using and abusing scripts and systems
468.10s - 470.58s |  and controls within the endpoints themselves
470.58s - 472.34s |  that were designed for system admins
472.34s - 473.38s |  to make their lives easier.
473.38s - 476.18s |  I mean, remote desktop protocol guys,
476.18s - 479.54s |  like it's designed for somebody with privilege
479.54s - 482.10s |  to go in and fix another user's computer.
482.10s - 483.90s |  Boy, I can't imagine how an adversary
483.90s - 485.50s |  is gonna use that, right?
485.50s - 487.74s |  That's an easy lateral movement.
487.74s - 490.46s |  And you get such friction from the business side
490.46s - 492.38s |  to turn that off because what's the solution
492.38s - 494.30s |  in an increasingly remote world?
495.18s - 496.86s |  So really what we've discovered is one,
496.86s - 498.22s |  you have to be really careful.
498.22s - 500.10s |  Allow listing and block listing
500.10s - 502.46s |  doesn't matter as much anymore.
502.46s - 504.18s |  I mean, obviously make sure
504.18s - 506.50s |  that you have a centralized software center
506.50s - 508.98s |  and we can get more into remediations later,
508.98s - 511.46s |  but the major threat actors we've been seeing lately
511.46s - 515.02s |  have just been using and abusing these particular tools.
515.02s - 516.94s |  And so it's time that we stop talking
516.94s - 518.70s |  about IOCs explicitly.
518.70s - 521.78s |  And it's time that we start talking to MITRE's point
521.78s - 523.82s |  about how they're abusing these tools
523.82s - 525.74s |  and how we can sense that change in behavior
525.74s - 530.34s |  if you really wanna do something about it.
530.34s - 534.62s |  The biggest thing that I always think about
534.62s - 538.90s |  when considering state sponsored attacks is scale.
538.90s - 540.50s |  It's the amount of resources
540.50s - 542.94s |  that state sponsors can commit to it.
542.94s - 546.22s |  It's entire job and workforce.
546.22s - 549.94s |  So the days are gone when I can reliably hope
549.94s - 551.18s |  for a single adversary.
551.18s - 552.66s |  That's never the case.
553.58s - 558.10s |  So now I'm up against teams who has a lot of money,
559.02s - 563.18s |  a lot of compute, and very, very distributed
563.18s - 564.98s |  with interesting, sophisticated attacks
564.98s - 567.62s |  to spend their own R&D money on.
567.62s - 570.42s |  That's the landscape of sponsored attacks.
571.30s - 573.78s |  And that stuff, to your point, does trickle down
573.78s - 575.78s |  where we're now seeing the darkness,
575.78s - 578.26s |  some of those same tech from a few years back
578.26s - 579.98s |  available as a service.
580.98s - 585.74s |  And the next evolution to change the individual players
585.74s - 588.30s |  are models like WhiteRabbit and Neo
588.30s - 593.10s |  that allows you to ask a AI without guardrails,
593.10s - 595.30s |  hey, how do I do a DDoS?
595.30s - 598.90s |  And it gives you a pretty simple example in Python.
598.90s - 601.58s |  So now we have tools that can supercharge
601.58s - 604.34s |  the average person to become a one-person team.
604.34s - 607.50s |  And that is pretty terrifying to think about.
607.50s - 610.42s |  And now let's add that to the state sponsored level.
610.42s - 613.22s |  All that R&D money, all that resource,
613.22s - 615.54s |  all that GPU access,
615.54s - 621.09s |  that's the current reality we're up against.
621.09s - 622.41s |  Okay.
622.41s - 627.21s |  So I would agree to what other panelists say,
627.21s - 629.25s |  but one thing that I would like to add here
629.25s - 634.25s |  is when we talk about advanced adversaries,
634.57s - 637.45s |  are we really defending even for normal attacks?
637.45s - 640.49s |  So if you look at any previous hack,
640.49s - 642.77s |  as I said, Microsoft, for example,
642.77s - 645.45s |  if an organization at the level of Microsoft
645.45s - 647.29s |  or for that matter, any tech organization,
647.29s - 650.89s |  they can't compromise just using a password spray attack.
650.89s - 654.85s |  That's not absolutely anything that is sophisticated.
654.85s - 657.21s |  You know, just so blowing our own trumpet here.
657.21s - 660.69s |  So when we teach, let's say Azure Red TV,
660.69s - 663.93s |  we don't even consider password spraying as a valid attack.
663.93s - 665.09s |  We mentioned that and we said,
665.09s - 667.69s |  okay, this is not going to work against Azure
667.69s - 668.53s |  without testing.
668.53s - 670.93s |  I mean, that is the sort of confidence we had,
670.93s - 673.45s |  we used to have on Microsoft.
673.45s - 676.45s |  So what I think is lacking wherever,
676.45s - 679.49s |  whether it is the advanced adversaries
679.49s - 681.65s |  or your good attackers like penetration testers
681.65s - 684.69s |  or Red Teamers, is the basic hygiene.
684.69s - 688.93s |  Are we still leaving credentials in clear text on shares
688.93s - 690.49s |  in an internal environment?
690.49s - 692.33s |  Oh yes, probably.
692.33s - 695.29s |  So that doesn't need any research,
695.29s - 697.49s |  any research budget at all.
697.49s - 702.49s |  So that is what I like to bring in for the basic hygiene.
703.17s - 707.41s |  Doesn't need an advanced adversary to read your credentials
707.41s - 709.65s |  or, you know, have an SMB really attack
709.65s - 711.73s |  or for that matter, I mean, you know,
711.73s - 715.81s |  sending a phishing link to one of your employees.
715.81s - 719.53s |  So defense in depth, not even that basic security hygiene,
719.53s - 721.89s |  if you follow that, you can actually stop,
722.29s - 724.37s |  using it once again from Microsoft's marketing,
724.37s - 727.33s |  99% of the attacks, that's true.
727.33s - 729.89s |  So that is what my point is.
729.89s - 736.42s |  On top of that, I would add something for Red Teamers,
736.42s - 737.78s |  give them time.
737.78s - 740.14s |  If you are in an organization,
745.36s - 747.44s |  if you're in a position to make a decision,
747.44s - 750.28s |  do not get your Red Team operations done in a week.
750.28s - 752.04s |  Don't do that, please.
752.04s - 754.12s |  Provide the good attackers more time.
754.12s - 757.36s |  You know, APTs include the word persistent.
757.36s - 760.44s |  Have persistently tested your stuff.
760.44s - 762.64s |  It's not going to happen in a week or two
762.64s - 766.24s |  where you give a couple of IPs to your good attackers
766.24s - 768.80s |  and say that, okay, these are our firewall IPs.
768.80s - 770.96s |  Let's see if you can get your domain admin.
770.96s - 773.68s |  That's not unfortunately how it is going to be
773.68s - 775.08s |  for the actual attackers.
775.96s - 777.60s |  Yeah, and one more thing for the Red Teamers,
777.60s - 779.04s |  domain admin is not everything.
779.04s - 781.08s |  Don't go for that all the time.
782.28s - 783.28s |  Yeah, that's for me.
786.06s - 788.10s |  But use this immediately.
788.10s - 790.10s |  I stand with Nikhil on this
790.10s - 795.06s |  because he taught a generation of AI hackers in India
795.06s - 797.58s |  with respect to Red Teaming, right?
797.58s - 799.66s |  I also would like to add a point in there,
799.66s - 801.02s |  a humiliating one.
801.02s - 805.22s |  So I was performing Red Teaming for one of my clients, right?
805.22s - 807.54s |  I'm not going to tell that maybe.
807.54s - 808.94s |  I'm not, okay.
808.94s - 809.90s |  I should not.
809.90s - 813.42s |  So I found a service, like he mentioned, the hygiene.
813.42s - 815.66s |  I have seen a service account in there
815.66s - 819.70s |  that has been waiting for me for the last 18 years.
819.70s - 822.46s |  They created that service account in there
822.46s - 824.50s |  when I was studying in my, I don't know,
824.50s - 826.42s |  maybe eighth or ninth standard.
826.42s - 828.66s |  And it was there for like waiting for me.
828.66s - 830.86s |  Come and break me, come and break me.
830.86s - 832.42s |  I'm waiting for you, right?
832.42s - 834.50s |  It was there for 18 years.
834.50s - 837.14s |  It was like within a couple of minutes we got that.
837.14s - 838.02s |  I was amazed.
838.02s - 840.98s |  Okay, this is when the password was last changed.
840.98s - 844.50s |  That was in 2000, yeah, 2002, I guess, right?
844.50s - 846.86s |  This is, the basic security hygiene is important
846.86s - 848.86s |  because if you're looking at the attacks
848.86s - 850.82s |  happening around the globe,
850.82s - 852.90s |  they are not, sometimes they are not even using
852.90s - 854.94s |  a sophisticated attack vector.
854.94s - 858.34s |  They're just getting in, you know, by brute forcing SSH,
858.34s - 859.98s |  brute forcing RDP, or, you know,
859.98s - 861.10s |  finding stolen credentials.
861.10s - 863.46s |  I mean, these are very, very, very, you know,
863.46s - 866.62s |  basic matter of security hygiene.
866.62s - 868.38s |  I'm not going to take much more time
868.38s - 871.10s |  because once I start talking, then done.
871.10s - 873.82s |  Okay, I'm going to give back to the panel
873.82s - 876.10s |  so that they can share their insights
876.10s - 880.02s |  on how even the major organizations are getting breached.
880.02s - 881.10s |  Right?
881.10s - 884.42s |  Some of them are considered to be impenetrable, right?
884.42s - 887.99s |  So I'm going to, you know.
887.99s - 888.87s |  Pass it back.
890.11s - 890.95s |  You starting with me again?
890.95s - 891.87s |  Yeah.
891.87s - 893.71s |  Okay, I guess starting with me again.
895.23s - 898.95s |  So MITRE's got a pretty good example of this.
898.95s - 902.43s |  We came out in public a matter of months ago
902.43s - 907.43s |  that we had had a breach into a lab network at MITRE.
907.75s - 911.35s |  And so, you know, adversary had used a couple of zero days
911.35s - 912.71s |  against the security appliance
912.71s - 915.83s |  had gotten into the ESX infrastructure
915.83s - 918.31s |  that was within that lab.
918.31s - 921.95s |  And so, you know, we try pretty hard at security,
921.95s - 925.59s |  but, you know, there, we patched as fast
925.59s - 927.03s |  as the patches were available.
927.03s - 929.71s |  We watched the stuff as well as we could,
929.71s - 931.63s |  but they were getting into places
931.63s - 934.99s |  that just hadn't necessarily been seen yet,
934.99s - 939.55s |  or, you know, just a couple days ahead of the zero days.
939.55s - 941.43s |  And so, you know, I'd like to suggest,
941.43s - 944.11s |  and I know some people in sort of software hardening
944.11s - 945.51s |  might get mad at me for this,
945.51s - 948.71s |  but that if an adversary is willing
948.71s - 951.47s |  to dedicate enough resources to it,
951.47s - 954.19s |  they are going to get into their target.
954.19s - 956.87s |  You know, if it doesn't work
956.87s - 959.31s |  through some sort of connected means,
959.31s - 961.43s |  you always have close access operations,
961.43s - 965.67s |  you can, you know, send somebody to the environment.
965.67s - 967.67s |  And so it's, you know, one of the reasons
967.67s - 971.11s |  that even organizations that are getting a lot right
971.11s - 974.19s |  are still having problems is that, you know,
974.19s - 977.47s |  we do have places that are willing to escalate
977.47s - 980.39s |  right up until they succeed.
980.39s - 982.27s |  And so as long as that's going on,
982.27s - 983.67s |  as long as we have people sort of willing
983.67s - 984.83s |  to dedicate resources,
984.83s - 987.99s |  and as long as you're a juicy enough target,
987.99s - 990.31s |  you know, it is, you're going to have to sort of
990.31s - 994.23s |  deal with containment, deal with being able to detect it,
994.23s - 995.99s |  deal with the fallout,
995.99s - 999.71s |  rather than just assuming that you can keep them out.
999.71s - 1003.47s |  We also just have so many interconnected complex systems.
1003.47s - 1007.95s |  And so cloud has definitely made this harder
1007.95s - 1010.87s |  where we have new systems that can get,
1010.91s - 1014.67s |  adversaries can get into more challenging visibility
1014.67s - 1017.03s |  in being able to monitor those systems
1017.03s - 1019.67s |  and just creating a bigger surface now
1019.67s - 1026.74s |  that people have access to.
1026.74s - 1029.66s |  That's very similar to what we've been observing
1029.66s - 1033.54s |  on our level, which I can't disclose who our clients are,
1033.54s - 1037.62s |  but we see, we're certainly not protecting the NSA yet.
1039.18s - 1042.86s |  That said, a lot of the attacks
1042.86s - 1045.10s |  that we've been seeing are opportunistic.
1045.10s - 1047.42s |  So to the point of basic security hygiene,
1047.42s - 1050.02s |  you don't need a pen test to know that you need
1050.02s - 1052.74s |  to get business buy-in to get MFA enabled, right?
1054.94s - 1059.30s |  It's the trick of convincing them that this is worth doing.
1059.30s - 1062.34s |  And to that, I can add a couple of stories.
1062.34s - 1065.10s |  For example, about one out of every four
1065.10s - 1068.74s |  or one out of every five of the people that we onboard
1068.74s - 1072.86s |  at our MDR are in the middle of an active BEC,
1072.86s - 1074.14s |  business email compromise.
1074.18s - 1077.18s |  They had no idea that they were compromised.
1077.18s - 1079.86s |  We would go in as part of the onboarding process
1079.86s - 1081.34s |  and our SOC will get tickets all the time.
1081.34s - 1083.50s |  Hey, we're pinging.
1083.50s - 1085.58s |  Can you isolate that for us, please?
1085.58s - 1086.42s |  Thank you.
1087.38s - 1089.98s |  And they got it as a preventative
1089.98s - 1092.42s |  without knowing that they were actively infected
1092.42s - 1095.50s |  and in some cases for months
1095.50s - 1097.10s |  before they were able to detect that.
1097.10s - 1100.70s |  And so to reiterate, if they wanna get in,
1100.70s - 1101.54s |  they're gonna get in.
1101.54s - 1104.66s |  And even if you're not a major organization,
1104.66s - 1107.38s |  all it takes is one person to get in.
1107.38s - 1109.58s |  And I think part of the problem here is
1109.58s - 1112.94s |  that we're dealing with people don't like the idea
1112.94s - 1114.50s |  of them going into our home.
1115.46s - 1117.62s |  Our servers, our environment, our endpoints,
1117.62s - 1119.86s |  this is where we live in a digital era.
1119.86s - 1120.98s |  Especially if you work from home,
1120.98s - 1123.54s |  there is something very personal and intimate.
1123.54s - 1126.90s |  And thinking about somebody inside your system
1126.90s - 1128.26s |  is a little bit like coming home
1128.26s - 1129.46s |  and having the door wide open
1129.46s - 1130.78s |  and seeing muddy footprints in front of you.
1130.78s - 1131.62s |  It terrifies you.
1131.62s - 1134.34s |  So you spend bazillions of dollars
1134.34s - 1136.14s |  preventing that from ever being seen.
1136.14s - 1138.78s |  But the adversaries are sophisticated enough,
1138.78s - 1140.98s |  even at a script kiddie level,
1140.98s - 1145.06s |  thanks to trickle down dark web economics, I suppose,
1146.46s - 1149.46s |  that they're cleaning up after themselves
1149.46s - 1151.78s |  and the door is very carefully locked behind them.
1151.78s - 1153.46s |  You cannot tell.
1153.46s - 1158.46s |  And so what I would recommend and reiterate
1158.70s - 1160.62s |  is that you can spend all of this money
1160.62s - 1164.94s |  on every phishing email attention and antivirus and EDR.
1164.94s - 1167.98s |  Those are important core technologies
1167.98s - 1169.66s |  that you need for both compliance
1169.66s - 1172.14s |  and just getting rid of the kind of the base level.
1172.14s - 1174.90s |  But don't think that you've stopped everyone.
1174.90s - 1177.74s |  We had a supply chain attack actually
1177.74s - 1180.10s |  with a critical infrastructure partner.
1180.10s - 1183.10s |  It was a supply chain business email compromise
1183.10s - 1185.34s |  that I'm thinking of specifically.
1185.38s - 1188.54s |  Their partner was compromised, but didn't know it.
1188.54s - 1192.90s |  And one of their personnel sent an email that was expected.
1192.90s - 1194.30s |  They wrote it all nine
1195.86s - 1200.38s |  to our protected critical infrastructure environment
1200.38s - 1201.22s |  about a meeting.
1201.22s - 1204.18s |  And it had an attachment and it wasn't the attachment,
1204.18s - 1207.90s |  the email PDF that was actually the vector.
1207.90s - 1210.94s |  It was the image file in this signature line,
1211.82s - 1213.18s |  which was fricking...
1214.02s - 1215.94s |  It was bad.
1215.94s - 1220.42s |  It was very naughty of them, but it was just so clever.
1220.42s - 1223.14s |  And they had ended up compromising several
1223.14s - 1227.30s |  of that other organizations.
1227.30s - 1229.18s |  And so these people were sending out
1229.18s - 1232.62s |  completely legitimate emails that were actually phishing.
1232.62s - 1237.62s |  And we tripped up on attempted NTLM credential theft
1237.86s - 1239.94s |  was how we ended up catching it.
1239.94s - 1241.78s |  Because at that point they got in
1241.78s - 1243.02s |  and it wasn't even your front door.
1243.86s - 1244.70s |  It was somebody else's.
1244.70s - 1245.54s |  And it was a complete...
1245.54s - 1246.90s |  You would never have guessed this was a phishing email.
1246.90s - 1249.26s |  I still read this and I'm like, is there a typo?
1249.26s - 1253.34s |  It was just the image in the email subject line,
1253.34s - 1255.62s |  excuse me, signature line.
1255.62s - 1262.22s |  So just food for thought.
1262.22s - 1264.82s |  At this scale of our organization,
1264.82s - 1267.14s |  the size of the United States government,
1267.14s - 1271.42s |  there is no version where they're doing all the security
1271.42s - 1274.26s |  by themselves, where they're going to rely
1274.30s - 1276.42s |  on private industry vendors.
1276.42s - 1281.22s |  There's no version where that's remotely conceivable
1281.22s - 1285.22s |  to replace private industry.
1285.22s - 1288.30s |  At what point do you draw the distinction
1288.30s - 1290.62s |  of how you trust the company?
1290.62s - 1295.30s |  How far do you dig to find out if they have some,
1296.62s - 1299.98s |  at worst, a vulnerability they know, but don't disclose
1300.98s - 1306.54s |  or willfully ignorant and something popped.
1306.54s - 1309.82s |  The hardest part isn't whether or not we have to
1309.82s - 1312.54s |  or are willing to rely on these vendors.
1312.54s - 1314.86s |  Without that level of trust,
1314.86s - 1317.82s |  we can't also move this industry forward.
1317.82s - 1320.10s |  We all have jobs for this very reason.
1321.06s - 1325.10s |  And at what point can we start forgiving
1326.38s - 1328.82s |  ways to disclose information that's highly critical,
1328.82s - 1330.50s |  but also tightly held?
1330.50s - 1334.02s |  What's the difference between a zero day to hit MITRE
1334.02s - 1336.18s |  or a zero day that hits the White House?
1336.82s - 1340.29s |  Why is one more valuable than the other?
1340.29s - 1341.13s |  Thank you.
1342.25s - 1344.97s |  I would like to add on the same thing
1344.97s - 1347.29s |  on the supply chain stuff.
1347.29s - 1352.29s |  So that is what a lot of us call gentrification of security,
1353.61s - 1355.41s |  hiding stuff behind licenses.
1355.41s - 1357.25s |  You know, you get, you pay more.
1357.25s - 1359.65s |  If you want to be secure, you pay more out of that.
1359.65s - 1363.69s |  So for example, if you are an organization who has,
1363.69s - 1366.89s |  let's say their voice support outsource to Philippines,
1367.25s - 1369.13s |  your tech support to India and so on,
1370.01s - 1373.73s |  are you sure that the kind of security that your HQ
1373.73s - 1375.85s |  or your main office would have,
1375.85s - 1378.73s |  is that the same thing that your partners have?
1378.73s - 1381.97s |  I can tell you that coming from a poor country
1381.97s - 1382.93s |  that is still developing,
1382.93s - 1384.93s |  I can tell you that, no, that's not the case.
1384.93s - 1386.53s |  Having worked from people right away
1386.53s - 1388.21s |  from the easternmost part of the world
1388.21s - 1389.65s |  to the westernmost part,
1389.65s - 1393.25s |  that is something that always stand out.
1393.25s - 1396.33s |  An organization based out of, you know,
1396.73s - 1397.65s |  we call it the western world,
1397.65s - 1399.97s |  you call it the richer part of the world,
1399.97s - 1403.17s |  the kind of security features and the money
1403.17s - 1406.33s |  that they would have, even if it is the same organization,
1406.33s - 1409.57s |  is going to be entirely different across geographies.
1409.57s - 1412.89s |  And however, it is an internal trust that,
1412.89s - 1414.61s |  okay, this is my US office
1414.61s - 1416.01s |  and that is the same organizations,
1416.01s - 1417.41s |  let's say Bangalore office.
1417.41s - 1419.17s |  So we trust those guys.
1419.17s - 1422.37s |  However, the level of security controls the money
1422.37s - 1424.85s |  that is spent there, that is entirely different.
1424.85s - 1427.13s |  So that is a sort of a supply chain attack
1427.13s - 1429.53s |  that goes under the radar.
1429.53s - 1433.65s |  You look at your partners, but not your own offices,
1433.65s - 1435.69s |  if you're a large enough organization.
1435.69s - 1437.57s |  And if you are a small organization
1437.57s - 1441.81s |  that unfortunately not everyone is interested to talk about,
1441.81s - 1444.17s |  where you would have an organization of a thousand people
1444.17s - 1446.37s |  and a couple of IT guys, no, of course,
1446.37s - 1449.37s |  dedicated directing, then best of luck.
1449.37s - 1452.97s |  No one is interested in talking about you at the time.
1452.97s - 1456.29s |  So for them, I would say, pick up the open source,
1456.29s - 1460.37s |  much hated tools, the OSTs that people create
1460.37s - 1462.49s |  on weekends, on their own time,
1462.49s - 1466.85s |  pick them up, run it on your own, in your environments
1466.85s - 1468.49s |  and create your own IOCs.
1468.49s - 1471.73s |  If you're a small enough organization, no one cares.
1471.73s - 1476.62s |  You have to take care of yourself.
1476.62s - 1481.62s |  So I used to share a story about my school days,
1482.26s - 1483.82s |  shamelessly everywhere.
1484.62s - 1487.34s |  That's about I being bullied in the school.
1487.34s - 1489.18s |  So when I was in the lower primary school,
1489.18s - 1490.86s |  I was not this big.
1490.86s - 1492.54s |  I didn't have a mustache.
1492.54s - 1494.94s |  I was a very small, very lean guy, right?
1494.94s - 1497.26s |  So other people, they used to bully me a lot.
1497.26s - 1500.42s |  Then my mother, she got me into a karate school.
1500.42s - 1504.22s |  Then after a couple of years, I became a bit taller.
1504.22s - 1506.54s |  Then eventually I became kind of the bully
1506.54s - 1508.26s |  in my high school days.
1508.26s - 1510.46s |  So here we have been talking about
1510.46s - 1512.82s |  how we have been bullied so far.
1512.82s - 1516.02s |  All these organizations are getting bullied, right?
1516.02s - 1521.02s |  And now it is a time to learn from the wise people here,
1521.30s - 1523.78s |  how we can respond to such attacks.
1523.78s - 1528.78s |  So we have seen that all of these organizations
1529.30s - 1532.90s |  can be bullied, even using a small technique,
1532.90s - 1536.14s |  maybe to the, like, you know, Adam's apple,
1536.14s - 1537.42s |  very small technique, right?
1537.42s - 1539.86s |  Maybe you can try talking to your friends, right?
1539.86s - 1542.02s |  So we have seen that all these organizations
1542.02s - 1543.58s |  can be bullied.
1543.58s - 1548.14s |  Now, back to them, how we can respond to these attacks.
1548.14s - 1550.74s |  How can we respond to these incidents
1550.74s - 1554.14s |  in a better way that we could handle things, right?
1555.02s - 1560.89s |  Back to you.
1560.89s - 1562.73s |  So I think people might be expecting for me
1562.73s - 1565.25s |  to say use MITRE ATT&CK.
1565.25s - 1569.45s |  And that's not where you want to start.
1569.45s - 1572.93s |  I mean, and so a couple of people have mentioned hygiene
1572.93s - 1574.33s |  along the way.
1574.33s - 1578.53s |  And, you know, it sounds so basic,
1578.53s - 1581.09s |  but making sure that you're getting the basics right first,
1581.09s - 1584.09s |  you know, things like multi-factor authentication,
1584.09s - 1585.93s |  segmentation of privileges,
1585.93s - 1589.09s |  making sure that your network isn't just a flat space
1589.09s - 1591.81s |  that an adversary can dance around,
1591.81s - 1594.29s |  actually patching your systems.
1594.29s - 1597.25s |  And so, you know, working your way up through,
1597.25s - 1598.73s |  starting to look at behaviors,
1598.73s - 1601.29s |  looking at what people are doing in systems,
1601.29s - 1604.89s |  sort of more the ATT&CK end of things
1604.89s - 1607.85s |  where people are using EDRs and whatnot.
1607.85s - 1611.93s |  But I'm a huge fan if you've got your act together
1611.93s - 1613.37s |  on all of those things.
1613.37s - 1614.73s |  And, you know, you're talking a little bit
1614.73s - 1617.77s |  about how do we bring it back to the adversary.
1617.77s - 1621.29s |  I'm a big fan of direct adversary engagement.
1621.29s - 1623.49s |  So honeypots, deception,
1623.49s - 1626.21s |  actually placing adversaries in environments
1626.21s - 1628.09s |  where you're able to monitor them
1628.09s - 1630.61s |  potentially for long periods of time
1630.61s - 1632.21s |  for a couple of different purposes.
1632.21s - 1635.81s |  One is starting to understand what an adversary might do
1635.81s - 1638.33s |  when they think that they've broken into your environment.
1638.33s - 1641.29s |  If you've really got things going well
1641.29s - 1643.17s |  and you're able to get somebody to operate,
1643.17s - 1646.49s |  being able to see what exactly those things would be
1646.49s - 1650.17s |  that you might find out that they have ready for you.
1650.17s - 1651.85s |  The other thing is deterrence though.
1651.85s - 1654.45s |  So I've had some experience
1654.45s - 1657.85s |  with getting caught doing that by adversaries too.
1657.85s - 1661.93s |  And what we saw was that they were much more cautious
1661.93s - 1664.09s |  in how they operated in the future.
1664.09s - 1666.13s |  And so they realized that they had been caught.
1666.13s - 1668.97s |  They realized that they'd given up some of their trade craft
1668.97s - 1670.29s |  and we saw them back off.
1670.29s - 1672.53s |  We saw them spend more time doing
1672.53s - 1674.21s |  an attack we'd call discovery.
1674.21s - 1676.73s |  So figuring out, am I in the right place?
1676.73s - 1678.09s |  What's the system I'm on?
1678.09s - 1679.85s |  What are the systems around me?
1679.85s - 1682.33s |  Which can be really noisy activity
1682.33s - 1684.69s |  if you're watching for the right things.
1684.69s - 1687.89s |  And so serving as a little bit of deterrence.
1687.89s - 1690.81s |  And so once you're beyond the basics
1690.81s - 1693.49s |  and once you're bringing it back to the adversary,
1693.49s - 1697.01s |  if you really have all those things working together,
1697.01s - 1699.17s |  I'm a fan of taking it one step further
1699.17s - 1705.77s |  and starting to interact with them a bit.
1705.77s - 1710.77s |  I will start with MFA, please.
1711.21s - 1712.93s |  Please, just MFA.
1714.73s - 1717.77s |  That's my security hygiene pitch right there for today.
1718.57s - 1721.09s |  But okay, so let me build on that then.
1721.09s - 1723.13s |  Why do more organizations not have MFA?
1723.13s - 1724.25s |  Why do more organizations
1724.25s - 1726.09s |  not have these basic security protocols?
1726.09s - 1729.05s |  One, we're overworked and tired and under-resourced.
1729.05s - 1730.73s |  Just straight out, right?
1730.73s - 1735.37s |  Second reason, people see security
1735.37s - 1738.25s |  not as an insurance policy, but as a cost center.
1738.25s - 1739.57s |  And by people, I mean finance
1739.57s - 1742.17s |  and I mean the executives who control the budget.
1742.17s - 1744.77s |  They aren't here right now, you are.
1744.77s - 1748.73s |  You are the advocate for every user in your organization.
1749.57s - 1751.57s |  You wanna know how you use sophisticated
1751.57s - 1754.57s |  nation state attacks at your organization
1754.57s - 1755.97s |  regardless of the size?
1755.97s - 1758.49s |  You use it as an example.
1758.49s - 1760.33s |  Executives and people with finance
1760.33s - 1763.17s |  actually understand headlines, right?
1763.17s - 1765.45s |  Find ones that are similar to yours
1765.45s - 1769.49s |  and say, look, this costs millions scaled down.
1769.49s - 1772.37s |  This could cost us this amount.
1772.37s - 1774.77s |  And of course, do your ALE calculation,
1774.77s - 1777.33s |  percentage of probability of something attacking
1777.33s - 1779.49s |  times the cost of the impact.
1779.49s - 1781.69s |  Remember your soft costs, your knock-on costs,
1781.69s - 1785.33s |  your lost contracts and time and reputation.
1785.33s - 1787.37s |  Those are all in addition to whatever
1787.37s - 1791.17s |  your insurance premium is going to go up by, right?
1791.17s - 1793.25s |  Present that then, and then go to them and say,
1793.25s - 1796.13s |  if we enable MFA, it costs like nothing.
1797.69s - 1799.93s |  And your executives who will be on the line
1799.93s - 1804.05s |  and talking to the press when an attack happens
1804.05s - 1806.33s |  and you have paper trailed
1807.37s - 1811.37s |  everything of your recommendation, you will be fine.
1811.37s - 1812.49s |  The organization ultimately,
1812.49s - 1815.77s |  unless you are in critical infrastructure and healthcare,
1815.77s - 1817.21s |  data is at risk.
1817.21s - 1818.89s |  The company is at risk.
1818.89s - 1821.13s |  Livelihoods are at risks, but not lives.
1821.13s - 1824.25s |  You will be fine.
1824.25s - 1826.37s |  The executives know that they're on the line.
1826.37s - 1828.33s |  Bring it home to them and talk to them
1828.33s - 1829.93s |  in the language that they most understand
1829.93s - 1832.17s |  because it's easy for us to sit up here, right?
1832.17s - 1835.57s |  And say, yeah, easy peasy.
1835.57s - 1837.09s |  We know the solution already
1837.09s - 1839.73s |  for a lot of these nation state attacks,
1839.73s - 1842.53s |  but when boots on the ground, we're not there with you.
1842.53s - 1844.77s |  When you're trying to illustrate to them,
1844.77s - 1847.81s |  you're all fired up from DEF CON, from Hacker Summer Camp,
1847.81s - 1849.93s |  and you're trying to justify this expenditure
1849.93s - 1852.93s |  to those people, bring it back to the money
1853.81s - 1856.49s |  and then demonstrate how this is perhaps
1856.49s - 1858.33s |  a minor inconvenience,
1858.33s - 1861.17s |  but it's so much better than the alternative.
1861.17s - 1865.53s |  And you have all of the stories here at this conference
1865.53s - 1870.96s |  to fuel that for your next budget.
1870.96s - 1873.36s |  The thing to consider is psychology.
1875.04s - 1878.24s |  You have to ask yourself,
1878.24s - 1883.24s |  not who or how you get attacked, but why.
1884.68s - 1886.08s |  What is the motivation?
1886.08s - 1889.04s |  And that motivation direct influence
1889.04s - 1891.48s |  to how the attack is carried out,
1891.48s - 1894.24s |  because there is high value to attacks.
1894.24s - 1896.76s |  There are very noisy and very obvious
1896.76s - 1898.56s |  that winds up on CNN.
1898.56s - 1901.40s |  There's also a lot of value to attacks
1901.40s - 1905.76s |  that go unnoticed for days, weeks, months, and years.
1906.76s - 1910.84s |  So understanding the persona of your adversary
1910.84s - 1915.00s |  is so critical to even have a chance to push back
1915.00s - 1916.84s |  to wear that hat for a day
1916.88s - 1919.76s |  and really consider beyond what this attack
1919.76s - 1921.68s |  or what this person, this human is doing,
1921.68s - 1924.16s |  but what's their motivation?
1924.16s - 1925.76s |  What's their culture?
1925.76s - 1927.60s |  What's their everyday like?
1927.60s - 1930.36s |  Why are they even in that seat?
1930.36s - 1933.56s |  So think about the fact that the other side,
1933.56s - 1937.12s |  there's someone just like you just having a job
1937.12s - 1940.76s |  and well, you are it today for the target.
1942.68s - 1944.00s |  That is a very good point.
1944.36s - 1947.28s |  One tech aspect that I would like to address
1947.28s - 1952.28s |  is when we look at the defense versus offense side,
1953.96s - 1957.00s |  so the skills are not equal.
1957.00s - 1959.20s |  So on the offense side, on the red team side,
1959.20s - 1962.84s |  you would have tools that are not enterprise grade
1962.84s - 1964.56s |  if I use that word.
1964.56s - 1966.80s |  So for the attackers,
1966.80s - 1969.28s |  you would have tools like still mimic arts
1969.28s - 1971.04s |  and probably something similar that was written
1971.04s - 1974.76s |  by someone bored over a weekend or just out of interest.
1974.76s - 1976.48s |  Whereas if you look at the defense side,
1976.48s - 1978.20s |  they have a lot better tools.
1978.20s - 1982.20s |  So why is it that it is looked at
1982.20s - 1984.40s |  as a failure of blue side?
1984.40s - 1986.04s |  It is not the case.
1986.96s - 1989.52s |  The only thing that I would like to put in here
1989.52s - 1994.20s |  for the defense is we need to improve on what we look at.
1994.20s - 1996.68s |  So the parameter-based security is long dead.
1996.68s - 1998.60s |  Do not look at it that way.
1998.60s - 2000.44s |  So there are some very good points made by her,
2000.44s - 2003.24s |  for example, to let your executives understand that
2003.24s - 2005.64s |  even that wasn't eye-opening stuff for me.
2005.64s - 2007.88s |  Of course, we need to speak their language.
2007.88s - 2011.32s |  But on the tech side, I would say look for identity.
2011.32s - 2014.16s |  So if I may use some very tech words,
2014.16s - 2017.04s |  you know, like say attacks very specific to Windows,
2017.04s - 2019.92s |  credential extraction, overpass the hash,
2019.92s - 2024.92s |  replay of tickets, everything is abuse of an identity.
2025.00s - 2026.88s |  Do you look at that?
2026.88s - 2028.44s |  Can someone steal my credentials?
2028.44s - 2029.72s |  Yes, try to stop that.
2029.72s - 2030.56s |  It is fine.
2030.56s - 2031.40s |  They get it.
2031.40s - 2033.88s |  But when they are using those credentials,
2033.88s - 2035.72s |  that is where you step in.
2036.56s - 2040.16s |  And as you said, you know, you push them back.
2040.16s - 2041.96s |  So that needs to be changed.
2041.96s - 2043.04s |  Yes, tools evolve.
2043.04s - 2044.84s |  We've got, you know, your CISOs may get, you know,
2044.84s - 2046.96s |  new toys from RSA.
2046.96s - 2047.80s |  I take names.
2047.80s - 2049.32s |  I'm sorry.
2049.32s - 2052.36s |  So your CISO may get new toys, let's say from RSA.
2052.36s - 2053.20s |  That's fine.
2053.20s - 2054.60s |  But look at the identity part.
2054.60s - 2056.72s |  That is where everything is.
2056.72s - 2057.64s |  It may be hybrid.
2057.64s - 2058.80s |  It may be cloud only.
2058.80s - 2060.48s |  It may be on-prem only.
2060.48s - 2062.24s |  Do not look at the network.
2062.24s - 2064.24s |  It is the identity.
2064.24s - 2065.76s |  That is, it gets stolen.
2065.76s - 2066.60s |  Yes, fine.
2066.60s - 2067.44s |  It will.
2067.44s - 2070.24s |  But when someone uses that, you step in and stop them.
2070.24s - 2071.56s |  That would be my advice.
2072.44s - 2079.70s |  I'm going to add a point.
2079.70s - 2081.30s |  The mic is not letting me speak.
2082.82s - 2083.66s |  Okay.
2083.66s - 2087.46s |  I'm going to add a simple point to what Stryker mentioned.
2087.46s - 2089.30s |  Like, you know, the small things.
2089.30s - 2091.50s |  So there is a, there was an executive.
2092.34s - 2093.18s |  Okay.
2093.18s - 2094.18s |  There was an executive.
2094.18s - 2096.38s |  I think he's still here somewhere.
2096.38s - 2097.22s |  I don't know.
2097.22s - 2098.54s |  I don't know.
2098.54s - 2101.50s |  What he did, he was using MFA.
2101.50s - 2106.50s |  And he was using Google Chrome in his office laptop
2107.78s - 2111.62s |  with his personal email account.
2111.62s - 2113.98s |  All the credentials got synced
2113.98s - 2116.46s |  with that Google Chrome email account.
2116.46s - 2118.90s |  Then eventually he used the same account outside.
2120.38s - 2121.86s |  On a fine morning.
2121.86s - 2122.98s |  I don't know.
2122.98s - 2125.34s |  Always the breaches happens on Friday.
2125.34s - 2127.54s |  I don't know the logic of that.
2127.54s - 2131.22s |  Or it's only after Friday or during Christmas.
2131.22s - 2133.06s |  That's Christmas near you, right?
2133.06s - 2134.14s |  I don't know how it is.
2134.14s - 2134.98s |  I don't know.
2134.98s - 2137.06s |  Maybe that's how it works.
2137.06s - 2139.06s |  Then that email got breached.
2139.06s - 2140.94s |  Then all the credentials were there.
2140.94s - 2142.54s |  Some of them might be having MFA.
2142.54s - 2143.82s |  Some of them might not.
2143.82s - 2147.14s |  And this guy, he was also using a small extension
2147.14s - 2150.46s |  in his browser as a substitute for 2FA.
2151.30s - 2152.74s |  I don't know.
2152.74s - 2157.74s |  Even after using 2FA, people can actually mess things up.
2160.86s - 2165.86s |  And we have 15 more, I think, 17 more minutes.
2166.86s - 2169.02s |  I'm going to add something to Nikhil's point as well
2169.02s - 2171.06s |  about the defense part.
2171.06s - 2173.10s |  So I always tell people, everyone,
2173.10s - 2175.62s |  the teams actually work for the defense.
2175.62s - 2177.50s |  That's where all the money is.
2177.50s - 2179.70s |  They have all the fancy tools.
2179.70s - 2180.54s |  You need to work with them.
2180.54s - 2181.90s |  You need to work with them very closely
2181.90s - 2185.50s |  to share or provide more value
2185.50s - 2188.22s |  in terms of offensive security assessments.
2188.22s - 2191.82s |  Then I started doing that in my life as well.
2191.82s - 2194.78s |  I got close with someone in the blue team.
2194.78s - 2196.26s |  Then I had to marry her.
2196.26s - 2199.98s |  But then again, I tell people, don't go that far.
2199.98s - 2203.30s |  Be friendly with your defense guys.
2203.30s - 2204.94s |  Share tactics.
2204.94s - 2206.50s |  Share the detection plans.
2206.50s - 2208.46s |  Then don't go that far.
2208.46s - 2210.54s |  I talk about it all the time, right?
2210.54s - 2213.10s |  And going back to the panel,
2213.10s - 2214.74s |  because we have like 15 more minutes,
2214.74s - 2216.06s |  if they don't have anything to say,
2216.06s - 2217.78s |  then we can take questions.
2217.78s - 2218.82s |  I will not be answering anything.
2218.82s - 2221.62s |  All these four guys will be answering your questions.
2223.46s - 2226.34s |  Unless you don't have anything more to say, yeah.
2226.34s - 2227.66s |  Yeah, let's do what they want to know.
2227.66s - 2237.71s |  Yeah, it's totally up to you, yeah.
2237.71s - 2239.27s |  Could someone get him a mic?
2242.26s - 2251.20s |  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2251.20s - 2256.95s |  It's going to happen every time.
2256.95s - 2258.63s |  I'm just finding the sweet spot.
2259.59s - 2264.87s |  No mic?
2264.87s - 2265.71s |  Oh, okay.
2265.71s - 2266.55s |  Yeah.
2266.55s - 2268.71s |  You told a story about the email compromise, right?
2268.71s - 2271.11s |  And there was an image on the signature, right?
2271.11s - 2272.55s |  Yes.
2272.55s - 2274.43s |  I'm trying to wrap my head around it.
2274.43s - 2276.07s |  Why would the adversary do that?
2276.07s - 2278.63s |  Because it's easy for them to open,
2278.63s - 2280.39s |  it's easy for the victim to open the attachment
2280.39s - 2281.31s |  rather than the signature.
2281.31s - 2282.83s |  I don't remember the last time
2282.83s - 2284.71s |  I clicked on an email signature.
2284.71s - 2286.91s |  So the question had to do
2286.91s - 2289.63s |  with the explicit business email compromise example
2289.63s - 2291.03s |  that I gave earlier.
2291.03s - 2293.79s |  Why would an adversary put it into the signature line?
2295.27s - 2296.95s |  I actually have a right,
2296.95s - 2299.19s |  I believe we presented on this at Black Hat.
2300.11s - 2301.51s |  That was one of the three case studies
2301.51s - 2304.59s |  that was picked by my VP, Mac,
2304.59s - 2306.75s |  as part of her presentation.
2306.75s - 2309.55s |  So I do have the actual technical information there.
2309.55s - 2312.15s |  It is literally just blanking on my head right now.
2312.15s - 2313.59s |  I will tell you the motivation
2313.59s - 2314.71s |  for doing something like that
2314.71s - 2318.43s |  within a signature line
2318.43s - 2321.63s |  is because if you have correctly targeted,
2321.63s - 2324.35s |  speaking of knowing the persona, right?
2324.35s - 2328.75s |  My client was a critical infrastructure client,
2328.75s - 2332.75s |  which means that they're susceptible to nation state attacks.
2332.75s - 2334.83s |  Like that is one of their targets, right?
2334.83s - 2338.63s |  If they get in there, they can have all of us, right?
2339.67s - 2343.39s |  So it was worth it to them to investigate the supplier
2343.39s - 2345.19s |  and the type of people that they worked with
2345.19s - 2347.95s |  and do those months and that research
2348.47s - 2351.31s |  but that's required days and weeks and months
2351.31s - 2353.11s |  in order to do that, right?
2353.11s - 2355.71s |  So then to your point earlier,
2355.71s - 2357.35s |  you don't wanna be noisy at that point, right?
2357.35s - 2360.55s |  You wanna do something that will escape
2360.55s - 2363.27s |  and evade traditional indicators of compromise
2363.27s - 2364.71s |  where you're not doing discovery.
2364.71s - 2367.59s |  It's a weird APT spray and pray approach, right?
2367.59s - 2370.23s |  You're trusting that you did your OSINT correctly,
2370.23s - 2373.79s |  your research and your reconnaissance
2373.79s - 2376.67s |  that you have in fact infiltrated the correct one, right?
2376.67s - 2379.39s |  So that's the first reason why you would do that supplier.
2379.39s - 2383.79s |  The second is you put it in the email signature line
2383.79s - 2387.19s |  because why would you write the phishing email for them,
2387.19s - 2388.03s |  right?
2388.03s - 2390.27s |  It's written by the victim.
2390.27s - 2391.23s |  They don't know their...
2391.23s - 2393.47s |  How often do you guys go and check your signatures?
2393.47s - 2396.43s |  Just out of curiosity, how often do you check
2396.43s - 2399.55s |  if somebody's changed your signature in your outlook?
2399.55s - 2400.71s |  Are you doing it now?
2401.99s - 2403.83s |  Yeah, I haven't looked at mine in a while
2403.83s - 2405.51s |  and now I'm suddenly very nervous.
2406.51s - 2409.59s |  And so it's something that it's a space
2409.59s - 2411.11s |  that you don't think to look.
2411.11s - 2412.71s |  You don't think to check.
2412.71s - 2414.83s |  We're looking for attachments on emails usually.
2414.83s - 2416.59s |  We're trying to distrust that.
2417.63s - 2419.91s |  The email itself triggered.
2419.91s - 2422.63s |  I don't actually recall what the image was.
2422.63s - 2423.71s |  It did require a click.
2423.71s - 2425.47s |  This was not clickless as I recall.
2427.47s - 2430.71s |  So something about that image was close enough
2430.71s - 2432.83s |  and familiar enough to the person sending the email
2432.83s - 2434.67s |  that they didn't question it.
2434.83s - 2437.83s |  It led to an attempted sign-in,
2437.83s - 2441.51s |  which was rather clumsy and suspected.
2441.51s - 2442.91s |  I don't know if I can say,
2442.91s - 2444.47s |  but it was a nation state threat actor
2444.47s - 2445.67s |  that was suspected based on some
2445.67s - 2447.23s |  of the other indicators we saw.
2448.47s - 2450.63s |  And it did lead to attempted credential theft.
2450.63s - 2453.11s |  So I hope that answers your question.
2454.03s - 2460.18s |  Yeah.
2460.18s - 2463.58s |  If you come up, we will read it back into the mic
2463.58s - 2489.39s |  and not kill you.
2489.39s - 2491.15s |  When you're dealing with an organization
2491.15s - 2493.91s |  with many, many endpoints,
2493.91s - 2496.83s |  what is the low-hanging fruit when dealing with tech debt,
2496.83s - 2498.19s |  when you're starting to implement this?
2498.19s - 2500.11s |  And I'll leave this to everybody else.
2501.55s - 2503.31s |  I don't know if we have quite enough cord
2503.31s - 2505.35s |  for me to answer this piece of it.
2505.35s - 2506.39s |  And so, yeah.
2507.67s - 2508.51s |  Just one suggestion,
2508.51s - 2509.83s |  if you're talking about an organization
2509.83s - 2513.75s |  that has 100,000 level systems
2513.75s - 2515.31s |  and it has a ton of tech debt,
2515.31s - 2517.23s |  really hasn't done a lot yet,
2517.23s - 2518.47s |  start with inventory.
2519.27s - 2522.07s |  And so it's amazing how many organizations
2522.07s - 2523.91s |  don't know what computers they have,
2523.91s - 2526.27s |  what systems they have hooked up to their network.
2526.27s - 2529.35s |  And again, it sounds super basic,
2529.35s - 2531.79s |  but it can be incredibly important
2531.79s - 2533.71s |  in actually dealing with a breach,
2533.71s - 2536.47s |  knowing what systems need which patches,
2536.47s - 2538.95s |  where you actually need to defend yourself.
2538.95s - 2540.71s |  And it's also sort of impressive
2540.71s - 2543.67s |  how many places don't actually have one
2543.67s - 2545.31s |  that are that sort of scale.
2545.31s - 2548.27s |  So at least that's my suggested starting point.
2550.79s - 2555.19s |  Start with your executives.
2555.19s - 2556.71s |  Check their systems first.
2556.71s - 2559.47s |  That's my personal contribution there.
2560.71s - 2566.49s |  I'm gonna hit back on the human factor.
2566.49s - 2569.77s |  Without some kind of a way to measure,
2569.77s - 2571.93s |  track, framework, et cetera,
2571.93s - 2574.45s |  of here's my standard for passwords
2574.45s - 2575.81s |  that you should probably use,
2575.81s - 2578.73s |  or let's not all use the same root password
2578.73s - 2580.29s |  for every server out there.
2581.41s - 2582.25s |  Might be a good idea,
2582.25s - 2584.93s |  but how do you pass those standards down
2584.93s - 2587.37s |  when the organization isn't by people,
2587.37s - 2589.05s |  it's 100,000 people?
2589.05s - 2590.17s |  How do you set that standard
2590.17s - 2592.69s |  where the expected behavior
2592.69s - 2594.93s |  is that you don't likely have more than one IT team?
2594.93s - 2597.01s |  So how do you pass information along,
2597.01s - 2599.93s |  and how do you also change the way people work?
2599.93s - 2601.41s |  Simply put, there are some systems
2601.41s - 2603.37s |  that are just an utter pain to get to.
2604.25s - 2606.41s |  So as an IT admin,
2606.41s - 2608.69s |  you're gonna come up with creative ways
2608.69s - 2611.37s |  to circumvent your own security
2611.37s - 2613.69s |  to be able to work on things.
2613.69s - 2615.57s |  So how do you set those standards,
2615.57s - 2617.49s |  and how do you communicate them effectively
2617.49s - 2623.33s |  to have an expected, we're all doing the same thing?
2623.33s - 2626.17s |  I'll say use the free tools.
2626.17s - 2628.89s |  That's how you find the low-hanging fruits.
2630.73s - 2631.77s |  I keep going back there
2631.77s - 2633.01s |  because that is what I experienced.
2633.01s - 2635.57s |  Do not go for the new shiny tools,
2635.57s - 2639.13s |  anything that shows up as ultra cool stuff
2639.13s - 2641.05s |  on your Twitter, on your Masternode.
2641.05s - 2642.85s |  Go for the basic free tools
2642.85s - 2644.77s |  that have been available for eternity.
2644.81s - 2646.01s |  Go for them.
2646.85s - 2648.69s |  Create your own baseline.
2648.69s - 2650.85s |  That would be a very good starting point.
2652.29s - 2655.25s |  All of us, any one of us can be owned
2655.25s - 2657.09s |  by someone sitting in their mom's basement.
2657.09s - 2659.77s |  So let's at least try to stop that.
2659.77s - 2679.67s |  So that's where you start.
2679.67s - 2681.07s |  Okay.
2681.07s - 2681.91s |  Yes.
2682.75s - 2685.43s |  So the question is,
2685.43s - 2688.15s |  who you think is a more dangerous threat,
2688.15s - 2691.59s |  a kid in their mom's basement or an actual professional?
2691.59s - 2692.47s |  We want to know the truth.
2692.47s - 2694.95s |  In my experience, it is the kid in the basement
2694.95s - 2697.51s |  because they are not limited by time.
2697.51s - 2698.99s |  They can be very persistent,
2698.99s - 2700.79s |  going after you for six months.
2700.79s - 2703.63s |  Whereas a professional, a consultant,
2703.63s - 2706.55s |  or even in your own in-house security team
2706.55s - 2708.59s |  would need to get that done in 10 days.
2708.59s - 2711.91s |  And you need the report on your table by 5 p.m.
2711.91s - 2714.15s |  So the kid in the basement, of course,
2714.15s - 2716.07s |  persistence, consistency pays.
2717.31s - 2718.51s |  Thank you.
2718.51s - 2720.87s |  So as we all respond enthusiastically,
2720.87s - 2722.63s |  yes, we worry about both.
2722.63s - 2725.39s |  But to your point, that kid in the basement,
2725.39s - 2727.75s |  because that kid's pretty bored.
2727.75s - 2729.83s |  That kid just wants to try things to go.
2729.83s - 2731.35s |  I wonder if this works.
2731.35s - 2734.55s |  If I get caught, do I get charged in the adult as a minor?
2735.87s - 2737.99s |  They have less legal liability, right?
2737.99s - 2743.34s |  So I would worry about that kid 100% of the time.
2743.34s - 2744.18s |  I think this gets back
2744.18s - 2747.22s |  to the annualized lost expectancy formula.
2747.22s - 2748.54s |  Honest to God, I swear,
2748.54s - 2750.98s |  I'm going to do math to my response here.
2751.06s - 2752.78s |  What is the percent likelihood
2752.78s - 2755.98s |  that an attack will happen in a given year
2755.98s - 2758.46s |  multiplied by the dollar value
2758.46s - 2760.90s |  of the impact of that incident, right?
2760.90s - 2764.10s |  Okay, so while the hacker kid,
2765.26s - 2767.26s |  God bless us all,
2767.26s - 2771.46s |  is more likely to find you personally interesting
2771.46s - 2773.58s |  just to say they did it,
2773.58s - 2775.38s |  to see how far they can push
2775.38s - 2777.78s |  and forget that it's a federal crime to do that.
2778.22s - 2781.14s |  Ah, that's more likely.
2781.14s - 2783.26s |  Let's think about what the actual dollar impact
2783.26s - 2785.58s |  to the business is, frankly, right?
2785.58s - 2789.82s |  Meanwhile, an APT is much less likely
2789.82s - 2792.34s |  to target an organization on average, right?
2792.34s - 2794.86s |  Just your average organization,
2794.86s - 2796.06s |  they might get caught up in a web,
2796.06s - 2797.26s |  they might be a supply chain attack,
2797.26s - 2799.58s |  but it's less likely that there'll be a direct target.
2799.58s - 2800.58s |  On the other hand,
2800.58s - 2803.34s |  the impact to the business is much greater.
2803.34s - 2807.02s |  So yes, we worry about both,
2807.02s - 2809.42s |  and it's easier to get justification for the APTs
2809.42s - 2811.10s |  because they're like big headlines
2811.10s - 2812.46s |  and no executive wants to admit
2812.46s - 2813.70s |  that they've been pwned by a teenager
2813.70s - 2815.18s |  in their mom's basement,
2815.18s - 2816.14s |  or their dad's actually,
2816.14s - 2819.26s |  I had to share a room with my civil engineer dad.
2819.26s - 2822.10s |  But you need to do that calculation
2822.10s - 2824.78s |  and that risk for your own organization
2824.78s - 2826.82s |  and then move forward with the solutions
2826.82s - 2831.42s |  that cost less than the actual expected incident rate.
2831.42s - 2834.26s |  And that is how you will make your finance people love you.
2834.26s - 2835.66s |  And that requires learning about
2835.66s - 2836.86s |  who you think is attacking you
2837.70s - 2840.80s |  and knowing what you have to protect.
2840.80s - 2842.48s |  I think the question is a trap.
2845.48s - 2849.36s |  So I think the only right answer to that is it depends.
2850.36s - 2854.28s |  But, and so whichever is successful
2854.28s - 2856.20s |  and causes damage to you in a way
2856.20s - 2858.20s |  that actually harms your organization
2858.20s - 2859.36s |  is the one that matters.
2859.36s - 2861.08s |  And that can be anyone.
2861.08s - 2864.44s |  That can be a script that got loose, went wrong.
2864.44s - 2868.16s |  That can be just a DDoS that accidentally got released,
2868.16s - 2869.40s |  but took out your network
2869.40s - 2871.56s |  and caused you to lose that big sale.
2871.56s - 2875.20s |  So it's, you know, it can be anyone.
2875.20s - 2878.28s |  We do have a big focus on talking about state actors
2878.28s - 2881.24s |  because they're a unit that we can really consider
2881.24s - 2883.72s |  that, you know, we've got cool names for them.
2883.72s - 2887.12s |  We might have giant statues of them at Black Hat,
2887.12s - 2890.40s |  but, you know, it can be anyone
2890.40s - 2893.88s |  that can cause sort of any impact to the organization.
2894.84s - 2900.74s |  So I think that's our last question.
2900.74s - 2902.62s |  The goons are about to kick us out.
2902.62s - 2905.22s |  So before that, I'll just add one more point.
2905.22s - 2909.26s |  So this is a part of community, like the hacker community,
2909.26s - 2912.90s |  because we create new tools.
2912.90s - 2915.22s |  We talk, I mean, we teach each other.
2915.22s - 2917.42s |  We kind of, you know, use that in use,
2917.42s - 2918.90s |  you know, increase our defenses.
2918.90s - 2923.26s |  So again, it is always good to be in the hacker community.
2924.14s - 2929.14s |  I mean, because from my personal experience,
2929.14s - 2931.26s |  if I'm sitting here along with these folks,
2931.26s - 2933.54s |  that is a part of community, right?
2933.54s - 2936.94s |  And I would like to thank the panel, the entire panel,
2936.94s - 2939.46s |  DEF CON, all the amazing goons out here,
2939.46s - 2942.06s |  all the, you know, participants.
2942.06s - 2943.50s |  Thank you. Thanks a lot.
2943.50s - 2947.46s |  And shameless plug, do visit Advasive Village.
2947.46s - 2948.30s |  Yeah, thank you.
