**Introduction to Speakers and Background**
- Ceri Coburn and Dirk jan Mollema are the speakers.
- Ceri has a background in **software development** and **cybersecurity**.
- Dirk has experience with **Active Directory** and **Azure AD** (now called **Entra**).

**Windows Hello Overview**
- **Windows Hello**: Microsoft's **passwordless technology**.
- **Windows Hello for Business**: Focuses on **certificate-based authentication**.

**Key Storage Providers (KSPs)**
- **Software Key Storage Provider**: Keys generated in software.
- **Platform Key Storage Provider**: For machines with **TPM**.
- **Microsoft SmartCard Key Storage Provider**: Stores keys on a **SmartCard**.

**Windows Hello Containers and Protectors**
- **Containers**: Store key metadata and protectors.
- **Protectors**: Methods of authentication like **bio protector** (face/fingerprint) and **PIN**.

**Abusing Windows Hello**
- **Privileged Access**: Abusing Windows Hello with system-level access.
- **Unprivileged Access**: Attacks from a regular user perspective.

**PIN Protector Vulnerabilities**
- **TPM-backed PIN**: Robust but can be brute-forced over time.
- **Software-backed PIN**: Vulnerable to attacks like **Hashcat**.

**Bio Protector**
- Not protected by biometrics but by the **system DPAPI key**.
- Can be bypassed with system-level compromise.

**Recovery Protector**
- Used in **Windows Hello for Business** for **PIN reset** without destroying keys.

**Passkey and External Key Abuses**
- **Passkey**: Used for **WebAuthn** and **Fido** based websites.
- **External Key**: Used with third-party applications like **OktaFastPass**.

**Primary Refresh Tokens (PRTs) and Entra**
- **PRTs**: Single sign-on tokens for cloud-connected services.
- **Nonce**: Time-bound value to prevent replay attacks.

**Golden Assertion**
- Method to bypass nonce by generating a timestamp with a wide validity range.
- Fixed by Microsoft with a new **nonce** implementation.

**Tool Demonstration: Shamai**
- **Shamai**: Tool to abuse Windows Hello keys.
- Features include enumerating and extracting keys and **PRT authentication module**.

**Mitigations and Recommendations**
- Use **device compliance** to prevent fake devices.
- Monitor new device registration and RDP access.
- Prefer physical keys over embedded Windows Hello methods.
- **Windows Hello ESS**: Newer technology with improved security.

**Conclusion**
- **Shamai** and **RoadTools** are tools developed for this research.
- Emphasizes the importance of staying informed on security improvements and vulnerabilities.
