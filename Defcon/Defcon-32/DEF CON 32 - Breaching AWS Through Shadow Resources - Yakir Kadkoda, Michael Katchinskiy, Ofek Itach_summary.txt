**Introduction to Session**

- Discuss vulnerabilities found in **AWS**
- Highlight potential for **admin role takeover**
- Debate on the secrecy of **AWS Account ID**

**AWS Account ID**

- Unique 12-digit identifier for each account
- Not considered a secret by AWS, but may pose security risks
- Security practitioners view it as potentially sensitive

**Shadow Resources**

- Resources generated automatically by AWS without user intervention
- Example: **S3 bucket** created during CloudFormation operations
- Can go unnoticed by account owners

**CloudFormation Vulnerability**

- Involves **bucket naming pattern** with predictable elements
- **Bucket namesquatting**: Attacker claims bucket before the user
- Leads to potential denial of service (DOS) and **information disclosure**
- **Resource injection**: Attacker modifies template file for account takeover

**AWS Glue Vulnerability**

- Requires only the **account ID** for exploitation
- Involves creating a job in Glue with a predictable bucket name
- **Remote code execution** achieved through modified scripts

**EMR Vulnerability**

- Triggered by creating a **studio** with a predictable bucket
- Involves injecting **JavaScript** into Jupyter notebooks
- Acts like stored **XSS**, redirecting users to fake login pages

**SageMaker and CodeStar Vulnerabilities**

- **SageMaker**: Data leakage and manipulation through predictable bucket names
- **CodeStar**: Denial of service by claiming bucket before user

**Bucket Monopoly**

- Strategy to increase victim compromise likelihood
- Involves claiming all possible bucket names across AWS regions
- Turns AWS into a landmine of **malicious buckets**

**Disclosure and Mitigation**

- Vulnerabilities reported to AWS and promptly fixed
- Recommendations include:
  - Using scoped policies with **resource account conditions**
  - Verifying expected bucket owner headers
  - Naming buckets with random elements to avoid predictability

**Conclusion**

- Six vulnerabilities identified in AWS
- Introduction of **Shadow Resources** and **Bucket Monopoly**
- Importance of securing account IDs and bucket names
