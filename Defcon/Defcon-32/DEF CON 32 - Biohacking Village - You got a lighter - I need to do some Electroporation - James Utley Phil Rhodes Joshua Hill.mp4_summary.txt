**Introduction to Talk**
- Welcome to the DEF CON 32 Biohacking Village talk
- Title: "You got a lighter? I need to do some electroporation"
- Clarification: Not about a **bio weapon**

**Speaker Background**
- Dr. James Utley: PhD in health science, biohacker, chief scientific officer at a regenerative medicine stem cell clinic in Panama
- Part of Viva Securus: medical device pen testing company
- Involved with Syndicate Laboratories: a biohacker collective in Las Vegas

**Purpose of Talk**
- Discussing a device developed for **electroporation**
- Emphasis: democratizing science using **frugal tools**
- Goal: Enable people to learn genetic engineering from home

**Electroporation Basics**
- **Electroporation**: Technique to deliver molecules into cells using electropulses
- Involves creating a pore in a cell to insert DNA/RNA
- Focus on using a **barbecue lighter** for electroporation

**Device Overview**
- Inspired by university students' electroporation device
- Aim to create a more accessible and simpler device
- Uses a barbecue lighter's PZT effect to create an electroporator

**Challenges and Considerations**
- Electroporation is complicated in a DIY environment
- **Key Parameters**: Electric field, ionic composition, and gap optimization
- Significant cell death is expected; efficiency is low

**Testing and Validation**
- Device tested for reproducibility
- Utilized high voltage multimeter for testing
- Reliability observed in voltage and resistance patterns

**DIY Electroporation Device**
- Components: Barbecue lighter, aluminum tape, adhesive magnets, cuvette
- Challenges with certain lighter brands (e.g., Bic lighters)
- Importance of **arc gap**: Use post-it notes and playing cards for measurement

**Applications and Experiments**
- Suitable for **E. coli** and stem cells
- Use of **green fluorescent protein** for visibility
- Experimentation can lead to creative outcomes (e.g., Nicholas Cage memes)

**Conclusion and Community Engagement**
- Encouragement to experiment with electroporation at home
- Appeal to join the biohacker community for those interested in science
- Reminder: Science is for everyone, and innovation can happen outside traditional labs
