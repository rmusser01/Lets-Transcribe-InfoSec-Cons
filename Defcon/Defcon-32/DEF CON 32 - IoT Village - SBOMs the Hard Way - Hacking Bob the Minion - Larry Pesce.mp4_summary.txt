**Introduction**
- This is a transcription of a talk given by Larry Pesce at DEF CON 32, in which he discusses his experience hacking Bob the Minion, a wireless home router.

**Larry Pesce's Background**
- Product Security Research and Analysis Director and Services Team Lead at Finite State
- Reformed penetration tester
- Co-host of Paul's Security Weekly
- Instructor and course author at SANS, specializing in wireless and IoT hacking

**Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**
- An inventory of all software, their versions, and their origins as part of product security.
- Can be used to identify vulnerabilities and perform risk mitigation.
- Will soon be required for many products, especially those connected to the internet.
- Several regulations are mandating or encouraging the use of SBOMs:
  - Executive Order 14208
  - 524 B for the FDA
  - Voluntary Cyber Trustmark program by the FCC
  - EU Cyber Resiliency Act (EU CRA)

**Hacking Bob the Minion**
- The device in question is the DavoLink AX1800 wireless router, shaped like Bob the Minion.
- Features include Wi-Fi 6, easy mesh support, and WPA3.
- The box claims it has 128 MB of flash and 256 MB of RAM, but there's no open-source support.

**Firmware Extraction Challenges**
- No updates or new versions of the firmware were available via the device's web interface or the manufacturer's website.
- No firmware available for download on the support forums or through Google searches.
- No way to recover the firmware from network traffic.

**Brain Surgery on Bob**
- Took the device apart, performed inventory, and analyzed the chips.
- Identified a Winbond W25N01GV flash chip with 1 GB capacity, despite the box claiming 128 MB.
- Attempted to dump the firmware via SPI using various methods, including soldering wires directly to the flash chip and using a Raspberry Pi.

**Findings**
- Exploits, exploit intelligence, remote code vulnerabilities, default passwords, and other sensitive information were discovered.
- The web application was poorly written, with potential command injection vulnerabilities via the password reset function.
- Scripts were found connecting to IPs in China.
- Attempts to fix the bricked device were unsuccessful due to a lack of NAND support.
