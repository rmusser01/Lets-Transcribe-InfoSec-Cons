0.00s - 5.84s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 So good afternoon, everybody, and welcome. This is my, amazingly, my second talk at DEF CON.
5.84s - 11.76s |  It's such a privilege and honor to talk once at DEF CON, but twice. It's just unbelievable.
11.76s - 16.96s |  So before I continue, I'd like to thank my colleagues, Kerry Coburn, John Waksmanski,
16.96s - 24.24s |  Mike Leonard, Ken, and yeah, the rest of the P2P team that are here helping out. I couldn't have
24.24s - 30.48s |  done this presentation without them. So I've got to do the obligatory, who am I? So my name is
30.48s - 36.32s |  Paul Brownridge, obviously. I started my working life as an engineer in Cape Town in South Africa.
36.32s - 44.16s |  I have an OT background, and then just by a series of accidents found myself into working
44.16s - 49.52s |  in cybersecurity. So I do a lot of OT testing, maritime, IOT, APIs, a lot of interesting stuff.
49.52s - 55.84s |  I mean, we do a lot of interesting stuff. So quite topical, probably something that's been
55.84s - 62.00s |  talked about maybe five or six times at this conference is the MV Dolly. Is it hacked? Well,
63.60s - 68.40s |  there's a lot of, lot of opinion on the internet, right? Everybody's an armchair warrior at the end
68.40s - 74.24s |  of the day. They reckon, yes, it was hacked. Definitely, it's deep state, etc. Other people
74.24s - 79.20s |  say, no, not possible. I think that once you understand how ships are architected,
79.76s - 83.76s |  do you understand actually that maybe the answer is somewhere in the middle.
83.76s - 86.96s |  And what I'm going to be doing is going to be going through the individual systems,
88.08s - 93.60s |  examining some of the attack surface, and maybe some of the threat vectors and that. So
94.24s - 102.08s |  really sort of like a high level view of the systems on the ship. So to be honest, you know,
102.08s - 106.00s |  before I came across this picture, I didn't know how much damage the ship actually done,
106.00s - 111.20s |  which is quite scary, isn't it? I mean, that is a mess or somebody's not getting the bonuses here.
111.84s - 118.00s |  And okay, so let's start with the main engines. So the picture that you see over there,
118.80s - 126.40s |  that is a typical engine on a container ship. It's one engine. It differs from other engines
126.40s - 131.52s |  that you're used to in that it's supported by ancillary systems. So there's pumps, for instance,
132.80s - 138.88s |  they handle the cooling, the fuel injection, etc. And these are handled by generators in
138.88s - 146.00s |  redundant arrays. The generators will power the steering without any power. Obviously,
146.00s - 151.36s |  there's no steering. And this is all organized by the power management system. So the PMS
152.24s - 158.88s |  that is in turn, managed by a network control system called the integrated alarm and monitoring
158.88s - 165.28s |  system. And then you have these multiple systems all over the ship that tie into it by a series of
166.40s - 171.04s |  either serial connections, either IP over serial, etc. And we'll take a look at those in turn.
174.45s - 178.53s |  Of course, we've got the steering controls, right? We have the controls at the helm,
179.49s - 184.77s |  tied into autopilot. And it's important to note that at this time, there is a physical switch
184.77s - 189.73s |  that if anything goes wrong, you can turn that off. It's as we go through these slides, it's
189.73s - 194.85s |  something to note all the time that is always going to be somebody in charge, which is really
194.85s - 200.29s |  important. So there we go, the helm, the steering gear, the steering flat, which is basically a
201.81s - 207.41s |  deck that you can steer the ship from any emergency situation, you can manually control the ship
208.77s - 213.25s |  in case anything goes wrong. All right, then of course, the systems tie into the rudder
213.25s - 217.01s |  and the steering gear. As I mentioned in the previous slide, it's all tied in with the
217.01s - 223.01s |  generators. So this is you can see the picture on the left hand side. This is what you see in
223.01s - 227.81s |  the movies, right? With the telegraph, you know, full steam ahead. But on the right hand side,
227.81s - 234.69s |  this is the more modern derivation of that. It's important to note that a lot of these systems are
236.45s - 241.17s |  tied down to certain revs, so that it doesn't cause any potentially dangerous vibrations on
241.17s - 246.93s |  the ship. Or sometimes it's also economics as well, because a ship will have a most economical,
247.73s - 253.49s |  I can say, revolution band, and they'll be tied into that. What's important to note that at any
253.49s - 261.73s |  time of this, yet again, the captain can override any of these controls. So if there's a blackout
261.73s - 266.53s |  on the ship, like what happened to Emi Dali, right? What are the procedures to restart this? Well,
266.53s - 270.13s |  normally it's as simple as pressing a single button on the screen, but how do we do this when
270.13s - 275.41s |  the rest of your ship does not have any power, right? So it could involve using controls local
275.41s - 280.05s |  to the generator to start, so you could send your engineers down there, waiting for it to come up
280.05s - 285.65s |  to speed, and then closing breakers, for instance. And this is important to note, because it's a
285.65s - 292.13s |  process like any OT system, any refinery, any chemical processes involved, everything works
292.13s - 297.73s |  in a sequence. There's no just like one button, bam, it comes on. It's a series of processes.
298.85s - 301.57s |  Sometimes you have manual management of the system will need to be performed.
302.37s - 307.17s |  As a load is drawn by the ship, this would take 30 seconds normally, but you never know,
307.17s - 313.49s |  and it might take several. But according to regulations, your emergency generator should
313.49s - 318.85s |  come on 45 seconds. But as we all know, in the real world, right, that hardly ever happens. I
318.85s - 325.01s |  mean, that's the ideal state. So what could take or is supposed to take 45 seconds could take
325.09s - 331.25s |  minutes. And if you are in the open sea, with a blackout, and your ship is coasting,
331.25s - 335.73s |  that is not a problem, right? But if you're approaching a bridge or a built up system,
336.61s - 341.17s |  just 45 seconds or even sometimes if these systems don't start, a minute or two minutes can
342.21s - 349.09s |  end in emergency, like we saw in the previous slide. So what triggers a blackout? Well,
349.09s - 354.21s |  bad fuel. Yeah, some of the cheapy fuel that you pick up these ports for, ship rolling,
354.21s - 359.65s |  some of the heavy seas can cause loss of pressure and cause the ship to blackout.
359.65s - 365.09s |  Could have electrical problems, bad maintenance, etc, etc. It's long. The older the ship,
365.09s - 372.53s |  the worse these problems get. And cruise ships do blackout. 2013 Carnival Triumph was out of
373.81s - 379.09s |  commission for a few days due to battery, the battery power failed several times. And
379.09s - 384.77s |  2019, the Viking Sky generator was out for service maintenance. Yet again, we see this,
384.77s - 391.49s |  so it's totally possible that these circumstances can exist, that a ship can blackout. So,
392.21s - 398.13s |  like I said, you know, all the armchair warriors on the internet saying it was a hack. Well,
398.13s - 407.49s |  we'll see. So let's take a look at the autopilot. So as we saw a slide early on,
407.49s - 414.45s |  the autopilot can connect directly to the engine. But it's always possible to disconnect the
414.69s - 418.61s |  autopilot and steer manually. As I said, this is very important to us. There's always a human
418.61s - 424.05s |  in the loop. But if we're taking a look at the threat landscape, we're finding more and more
424.05s - 428.93s |  that these systems are connected up to the internet. So firmware downloads and that. And
430.29s - 435.01s |  if we sort of break it down, we can see this almost becomes like a sort of supply chain attack.
435.01s - 441.97s |  But then you'd have to compromise the firmware supplies. You have to sign the firmware. So yes,
441.97s - 447.41s |  possible, but very unlikely. Unless you really expend a lot of energy going back and hacking
447.41s - 453.25s |  this buyer. Propulsion, rarely connected to the internet. But these are big, big chunky machines.
454.85s - 457.89s |  This is your typical OT versus IT segregation at the end of the day.
459.41s - 464.45s |  Attacks unlikely. And if it did happen, the bridge could manually override. Yet again,
464.45s - 471.23s |  somebody, a person's in the loop. The power systems, frequently network connected. Fair
471.23s - 477.23s |  enough. Right? And this is one of those situations that's becoming more and more connected as the
477.23s - 483.63s |  years go by. But attack is unlikely. And the bridge could manually override. Yet this recurring
483.63s - 488.27s |  theme is that there's always somebody that can change the ship or is going to be on bridge,
488.27s - 495.39s |  et cetera. So conclusion. Yes. Ships can be hacked. But it takes time. It's a manual process.
495.63s - 503.39s |  Oops, sea daisy. And was the MVDali hacked? Well, no. It's practically impossible. I mean,
503.39s - 508.19s |  it's possible, but it's very, very improbable. You need a large amount of time over there.
508.91s - 514.11s |  You need to know the systems. You basically need to engineer tons of social engineering. So for an
514.11s - 518.19s |  armchair hacker from, oh, I don't know, your nation state somewhere, hacking the ship,
518.19s - 524.75s |  very improbable. Unfortunately, polarized views from uninformed commentators do not help. You
524.75s - 534.14s |  need to understand how these ships are architected. So last year, I had about 150 slides.
534.14s - 542.62s |  And I managed to get to 120 of them before time got called. So I blasted to 30. So I'm going to
542.62s - 552.14s |  do a recap of what I did last year. And yeah. So this is the systems recap. Integrated control
552.14s - 558.14s |  and monitoring system. This is the brains, the eyes of the ship. This controls the PLCs in the
558.14s - 564.94s |  engine room, rudder control, power management. These extremely, extremely important piece of
564.94s - 571.26s |  equipment. Without it, the ship cannot operate. So from an attacker's point of view, this is a
571.26s - 574.94s |  high value target. So it's something that we take a look at all the time while we're busy pen
574.94s - 585.18s |  testing ships. This is the charting system. These run in redundant arrays. And basically, as you can
585.18s - 593.10s |  see, there's a map on there. It tells you where you are on the ocean. Obviously, without it, the
593.90s - 597.34s |  captain could not know where he's supposed to be going and the crew don't know where they're going
597.34s - 602.54s |  or where they are. So if these systems go down, then the ship has got to stop. But failing that,
602.54s - 607.58s |  particularly with some of the older ships, we've got some old school maps, right? You can see the
607.58s - 612.70s |  drawers over there. Those are actually all charts from the oceans around the world. And these get
612.70s - 619.82s |  delivered by hand whenever there's an update. So it's quite reassuring that you still have these
619.82s - 625.66s |  manual methods of the ship knowing where they are at the end of the day. Safety management system.
626.46s - 633.66s |  So this is a separate room, usually near the bridge, that whenever there's an emergency situation
633.66s - 640.46s |  on board, it is organized over here. So this is very interesting from attacker's point of view
640.46s - 648.94s |  because it has tendrils into the rest of the ship. It is from the ICMS all the way to the ECTIS,
649.26s - 658.38s |  pressurized doors, CCTV, fire alarm systems. This is so important at the end of the day because
658.38s - 667.50s |  you basically can coordinate with the lifeboats, et cetera. It's something to note as well that
668.62s - 675.10s |  as the crew is running around trying to organize an emergency situation, they can use these iPads or
675.10s - 679.26s |  these window systems to log in and take a look at what's going on at the same time.
681.70s - 686.34s |  It's an idealized version of the IT versus OT system of ship. We've got the internet coming
686.34s - 690.82s |  down via VSAT into the core. We've got the corporate network because as usual, you've got
690.82s - 696.50s |  your bean counters on the ship, your accountants and your people. Then you've got third parties,
696.50s - 703.46s |  something like point of sales, et cetera. And your crew is obviously, you need to provide Netflix,
703.46s - 708.18s |  et cetera for your crew. And that's split up into Wi-Fi and wired. You can see the line down
708.18s - 716.10s |  the middle. You see the bridge and the engine room. And this is what you want in the real world,
716.10s - 721.38s |  but it doesn't always work out because, yeah, we'll see a little bit later. This is really how
721.38s - 727.62s |  it looks like. It's a mess. So it comes on the VSAT into the core network and then the RDP,
727.62s - 733.06s |  not their protocol, but remote distribution points. And these are basically just big chunks
733.06s - 738.90s |  of Cisco equipment. We can see in the next slide. And these are broken down via VLAN trunks into
738.90s - 744.74s |  cabin switches. This is basically what it looks like. This is on the ship. So anybody who's been
744.74s - 750.26s |  in a data center, any on-prem stuff, it looks exactly the same. It's all off the shelf stuff.
750.26s - 759.70s |  It's nothing bespoke for the maritime industry. Breaking down further, we have the VLAN trunking
759.70s - 769.46s |  down to the cabin switches. And we have it split off into TVs, VoIPs, light, Wi-Fi, CTV, TV. The
769.46s - 775.22s |  most important thing to remember on all this is it comes down over a single connection, right?
775.22s - 781.06s |  And as an attacker, that is very interesting. So we got the propulsion system. This is Azipod.
781.70s - 786.82s |  In the olden days, you used to have the big rudders that used to have the pop wash. But now
786.82s - 794.10s |  these are independent systems that you can control from the ICMS. And actually, the recent
794.10s - 800.02s |  ones that we tested are controlled by Wi-Fi, just normal 2.4 gig Wi-Fi, right? Which is quite scary
800.02s - 808.78s |  at the end of the day. This is not even dedicated cables at the end of the day. So yeah. So one of
808.78s - 814.38s |  the things when we test ships is we walk around, and this goes back to my early days in refinery,
814.94s - 818.54s |  is you see pipes everywhere. You see cables going everywhere. You don't know where everything is. So
818.54s - 825.34s |  you spend such a large amount of time chasing stuff down. And because ships have this churn
825.34s - 830.78s |  of engineers, et cetera, a lot of people don't know where the systems do, or even sometimes
830.78s - 833.90s |  they leave the systems on because they're too afraid to turn them off. Because they don't know
833.90s - 836.86s |  what it does, but they don't want to turn it off at the end of the day, right? So in case something
836.86s - 840.46s |  goes wrong, it's like, okay, cool. So you have systems just running like this constantly.
840.46s - 847.82s |  So we knew there was something coming in that monitored the fuel consumption, but we didn't
847.82s - 853.58s |  know where it was, right? So eventually we opened up the panels, and we put it inside,
853.58s - 859.26s |  and we found this little bugger over here. This is like a rugged PC. It's a Windows-based PC.
860.78s - 865.10s |  But we wanted to know more of what it did, right? So you can see on the side over there,
866.94s - 871.66s |  anybody who worked with OT systems a lot, you'll recognize that little box over there. That's an
871.66s - 879.02s |  IP to serial connector. So what it does, it takes IP, internet protocol, then it changes it into
881.58s - 888.78s |  serial bus. Now, the thing is, when you work in OT, these systems have been around for 30,
888.78s - 893.90s |  40 years, and they still operate on discrete systems. So this is why you have the IP to serial.
894.46s - 903.98s |  We wanted to model the attack surface and that. So what we did is we took a look. So we knew that
903.98s - 910.70s |  the IP to serial was going to the bridge ICMS. This was going to the charting system. So it would
910.70s - 915.18s |  track where we were at a certain time from one distance to the next, but it was also talking
915.18s - 920.46s |  to the PLCs on the main engine. It was asking for revolutions a second. It was asking for
920.46s - 927.66s |  maybe fuel consumption, and then it was doing some fancy mathematics and was predicting the
927.66s - 933.66s |  fuel consumption. So what we did is once we took a look at the IP to serial connection
934.38s - 939.42s |  going to the bridge, we noticed that instead of three wires, you can see there's two wires. There's
939.42s - 945.58s |  the ground and one of the serial connections in there. We noticed that one of the wires was
945.58s - 952.86s |  missing. So usually when you have a serial to serial connection, you'll pull the PLC or the
952.86s - 957.82s |  piece of equipment, and it'll talk back to you. But that's how it would normally happen. What we
957.82s - 962.22s |  found is it was transmit only. So the piece of equipment was just taking pulling from the bridge,
962.22s - 965.42s |  which is great. I mean, from attacker's point of view, there's nothing you can do. You can't
965.42s - 971.18s |  inject anything down the line. Fantastic, right? But then we started taking a look at the connection
971.18s - 977.42s |  from the IP to serial to the PLC, and that was using Modbus. So now Modbus, five minutes.
978.14s - 985.10s |  Seriously? All right. So it's using Modbus, right? And Modbus was, that went quickly, right?
985.10s - 990.30s |  And Modbus is like a, you have to call out to the piece of equipment for it to broadcast its value
990.30s - 996.54s |  to you. So this is interesting from attacker's point of view because now we have access to the
996.54s - 1002.06s |  machine. So now we can inject values into the PLCs at the end of the day. And in terms of attack
1002.06s - 1008.06s |  surface, this is very interesting to us. However, what was more interesting, forgive, like I said,
1008.06s - 1011.66s |  I got lots of slides, right? So what was more interesting, we took a look at the system,
1012.22s - 1019.82s |  and we noticed we had team viewer on there, right? So yeah, yeah. I mean, what is more amusing,
1019.82s - 1024.30s |  even more amusing, was that the fact that the company actually had stopped paying for the
1024.30s - 1028.62s |  service four years before, right? But they were too afraid to turn it off, like I was saying before.
1028.62s - 1034.94s |  So you had a machine that was not updated. It was still connected to the internet. You could
1035.82s - 1040.06s |  potentially connect up to the PLC and ruin everything at the end of the day, right? So it was,
1040.94s - 1047.58s |  we found this very amusing. But it was good. I, yeah, I'm going to have to blast through my
1047.58s - 1053.66s |  slides again. I'm really sorry about this, guys. But how many minutes? Three minutes? Two minutes?
1056.69s - 1069.92s |  Okay. Shit, okay. So I'm going to blast my slides quick. Next year, when you come and see me talk,
1069.92s - 1074.00s |  I'll do this properly. I'll do this first so I can actually get through this the first time.
1075.68s - 1082.08s |  Basically, TLDR, we managed to compromise the trusses system from our cabins at the end of the
1082.08s - 1099.39s |  day. So I'm going to run to the conclusion. Those are really interesting slides, aren't they? Sorry,
1099.39s - 1109.58s |  guys. CT view again? Yeah. Okay. So I'm going to hack it up. So I actually had some stuff about
1109.58s - 1112.38s |  regulation as well, but that's very boring. Nobody wants to go through that. Okay.
1116.22s - 1121.66s |  So ships can be hacked, but it takes time and it takes presence. One of the things that we
1121.66s - 1125.42s |  noticed is that we have the advantage of when we're on the ship, we can talk to engineers,
1125.42s - 1129.26s |  we can look at the documentation, right? We can see what's going on. We can run the lines.
1130.62s - 1134.38s |  In an idealized world, hackers are not going to sit on the other side of the world,
1135.74s - 1139.02s |  go through the V set, take over the vessel. It's not going to happen.
1140.14s - 1144.22s |  However, social engineering is still a factor that is something to consider.
1146.06s - 1150.46s |  Convergence and modernization often introduce new risks, and it's true because a lot of the time
1150.46s - 1155.26s |  we're getting IPTCO. Before we had discrete systems, now we have trunking, like we said
1155.26s - 1163.10s |  before, and it's possible to RDP into systems, et cetera, to team view, right? There's undocumented
1163.10s - 1169.98s |  stuff everywhere. This is one of the things when we test a ship, we have a little AP monitoring,
1170.70s - 1175.98s |  and the client or the vendor has installed so many access points, right, that the client,
1175.98s - 1182.54s |  the retesting, has no idea what the hell is going on. Probably about six or seven undocumented
1182.54s - 1188.94s |  APs on a ship at any one time, which is bonkers, right? All of these just bridge the man over
1188.94s - 1196.86s |  there. It's crazy. And that's it. Thank you for coming to see my talk.
