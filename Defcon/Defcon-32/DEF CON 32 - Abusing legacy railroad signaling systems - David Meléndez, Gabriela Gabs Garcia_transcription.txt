  "title": "DEF CON 32 - Abusing legacy railroad signaling systems - David Mele\u0301ndez, Gabriela Gabs Garcia",
  "description": "In this study, we delve into the darker aspects of railway technology, revealing how easily accessible domestic hardware tools can compromise the seemingly infallible robustness of signaling systems. We demonstrate how these accessible technologies can be utilized to devise strategies that potentially threaten train circulation in Spain. Our research presents a critical analysis of the vulnerabilities present in the railway signaling systems, highlighting the ease with which these systems can be tampered with, using tools that are readily available to the general public. Through a combination of theoretical insights and practical demonstrations, we offer a comprehensive overview of the risks associated with such vulnerabilities.\n\nOur findings aim to raise awareness among stakeholders in the railway industry, prompting a reevaluation of current security measures and encouraging the adoption of more stringent protections against such threats. This paper contributes to the ongoing discussion in the cybersecurity community, offering valuable insights into the potential risks facing modern transportation infrastructures and suggesting avenues for future research and development in railway system security.\n\nWe consider this work to be innovative on a type of system that has been present for over half a century in railway infrastructures. Therefore, the references provided are primarily about the operation of the systems and relevant news concerning them.",

1.58s - 4.58s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Okay. Hello, everyone.
4.58s - 9.06s |  Yeah, NRG.
9.06s - 13.06s |  Thanks, everyone, for coming, especially to being the last day,
13.06s - 17.06s |  and most of the people that we knew are going home,
17.06s - 21.06s |  so we are very glad for us to have you here.
21.06s - 26.06s |  Thanks, the La Villa Hacker people that are here, I'm sure,
26.06s - 29.06s |  because I cried for that. Yeah.
30.06s - 40.06s |  And, well, we are prepared now to talk to you about railroad hacking.
40.06s - 42.06s |  We call this...
42.06s - 45.06s |  It's working? Not working? Okay.
45.06s - 48.06s |  We are Gabriela Garcia and David Melendez.
48.06s - 50.06s |  I am a security software developer
50.06s - 53.06s |  that got into hacking and hardware hacking
53.06s - 55.06s |  because of the hardware hacker people
55.06s - 59.06s |  that they like to introduce you to their weird world.
59.06s - 63.06s |  And David Melendez, I am the embedded software engineer
63.06s - 70.06s |  that is here to talk to you with me about railroad hacking.
70.06s - 74.06s |  We call this a dark territory because in railway sector,
74.06s - 77.06s |  a dark territory is a section of the railway
77.06s - 81.06s |  that lacks remotely control of signals
81.06s - 85.06s |  and you have no automatic blocking systems.
85.06s - 88.06s |  So in this area, the communication and coordination
88.06s - 92.06s |  is really exclusive on the railway operator,
92.06s - 98.06s |  and the term has gained popularity in railway hackers
98.06s - 104.06s |  to describe sectors that lack supervision in any other kind of way.
104.06s - 108.06s |  So we are introducing you Fun with Trains.
108.06s - 115.70s |  As you can see, graphic design is our passion.
115.70s - 121.06s |  So let me introduce you to some concepts.
121.06s - 123.06s |  For example, the railway block.
123.06s - 128.06s |  Railway block is a section that is normally no more than one train
128.06s - 133.06s |  can be present to evade collision between two trains.
133.06s - 138.06s |  This block session can be between stations
138.06s - 140.06s |  and can be between signals
140.06s - 146.06s |  for the railroad control people to be able to control
146.06s - 152.06s |  the passes of the trains between these blocks.
152.06s - 156.06s |  To know where and how they have been passing the trains,
156.06s - 163.06s |  we have axle counters that are systems that count the axis of every train
163.06s - 168.06s |  and every train needs to be the same amount of axles
168.06s - 171.06s |  in the first one and in the last one.
171.06s - 175.06s |  It's nice because you don't lose people or half of your train,
175.06s - 177.06s |  so it's very cool.
177.06s - 181.06s |  And we can have train blockings in different ways.
181.06s - 183.06s |  For example, we can give a token.
183.06s - 187.06s |  It's vintage, but it's still happening in some parts of the world.
187.06s - 193.06s |  You can give the railway operator a token and he takes it.
193.06s - 195.06s |  It's vintage, okay?
195.06s - 200.06s |  It takes it and then you know that this train has passed through your station.
200.06s - 205.06s |  The next technological advancement has been to call people
205.06s - 208.06s |  instead of giving them a token because it's weird.
208.06s - 213.06s |  So the telephone block is just to tell the next block
213.06s - 216.06s |  that the train is passing through your block.
216.06s - 219.06s |  It's less vintage, but vintage too.
219.06s - 223.06s |  And then we pass it to the train blocking, the electronic train blocking.
223.06s - 229.06s |  What we have is slices of railway that are controlled by signals
229.06s - 232.06s |  or controlled by a central operation center
232.06s - 240.06s |  that blocks the slice of railway when the train is passing out,
240.06s - 244.06s |  taking into account the data received through the axis counter.
244.06s - 248.06s |  We have it in one track.
248.06s - 252.06s |  We have two tracks and we have reversible two tracks.
252.06s - 260.06s |  So we can have control in every direction you have your train passing.
260.06s - 268.06s |  The control is just set by the side where these beacons in the railway are set.
268.06s - 272.06s |  So if you are in one direction,
272.06s - 279.06s |  the beacon that is controlling you is in the right side of the railway.
279.06s - 282.06s |  And if you are in the opposite direction,
282.06s - 285.06s |  in your direction there will be another beacon
285.06s - 289.06s |  controlling that you are passing through this segment.
289.06s - 291.06s |  And this is the central light traffic control.
291.06s - 294.06s |  This is specially in Madrid called Chamartín.
294.06s - 299.06s |  And there are lots of people working here
299.06s - 303.06s |  controlling that the trains don't collide, especially.
303.06s - 308.34s |  We have based this investigation in one of the systems
308.34s - 312.34s |  that is present in Spain that is called ASFA.
312.34s - 315.34s |  In Spanish it's Anuncio de Señales y Frenado Automático.
315.34s - 319.34s |  In English, Announcement of Signal and Automatic Braking.
319.34s - 323.34s |  What it does is support the train circulation
323.34s - 327.34s |  based on a core capacitor circuit connected to a signal.
327.34s - 331.34s |  And depending the signal, the aspect they need to transmit,
331.34s - 337.34s |  transmit one frequency or another in the onboard equipment.
338.34s - 340.34s |  So this is the whole process.
340.34s - 344.34s |  You have a railway signal that connects to a unit
344.34s - 347.34s |  that gives a signal to a beacon.
347.34s - 352.34s |  The beacon is received by the perturbation.
352.34s - 354.34s |  Is the name?
354.34s - 357.34s |  The perturbation is received by the antenna.
357.34s - 362.34s |  And this antenna gives a signal to a console that is inside the train
362.34s - 367.34s |  and gives different aspects related to different signs.
367.34s - 372.34s |  The first of all is that you can have fixed aspects
372.34s - 376.34s |  that are signals or beacons that only transmit one signal
376.34s - 382.34s |  and variable aspects that have beacons that have different signals.
382.34s - 384.34s |  And it depends on the frequency.
384.34s - 388.34s |  The frequency they leave the antenna is the aspect
388.34s - 392.34s |  that the railway operator is receiving inside.
392.34s - 397.34s |  So the first problem is that, as you can see,
397.34s - 402.34s |  a couple of different signals give different aspects.
402.34s - 407.34s |  Or the same range of frequencies give different signals
407.34s - 410.34s |  to the railway operator.
411.34s - 420.34s |  So, for example, the L1 and the L3 are in the same range of frequencies.
420.34s - 428.34s |  So we can have little problems when we are not controlling it as much as we need.
428.34s - 432.34s |  And this is the panel that the operator receives here.
432.34s - 436.34s |  It's completely in Spanish because this picture is taken
436.34s - 443.34s |  on open source documentation that the railway company in Spain
443.34s - 447.34s |  have completely publicly available on the Internet.
447.34s - 452.34s |  So this is a screenshot of their documentation.
452.34s - 455.34s |  And this is what the train driver sees.
455.34s - 462.34s |  As you can see, this little blue dashboard has some buttons
462.34s - 466.34s |  that represent the acknowledgement of the train driver
466.34s - 471.34s |  that they have received this signal or the advice of this signal.
471.34s - 475.34s |  So they push, I have acknowledged this signal,
475.34s - 479.34s |  and I have to keep moving forward.
479.34s - 482.34s |  And we get into what we call the dark territory
482.34s - 488.34s |  because there have been several serious accidents in Spain
488.34s - 492.34s |  related to the control of the signals.
492.34s - 495.34s |  The first one is the Huarte Araquil.
495.34s - 498.34s |  It was like 30 years ago.
498.34s - 504.34s |  And it was related to not having any kind of beacons or signals
504.34s - 508.34s |  or systems of control on the railway.
508.34s - 516.34s |  And the train driver saw a signal but misconfused the signal
516.34s - 524.34s |  and misinterpreted what he saw, and lots of people died.
524.34s - 531.34s |  And then, like 10 years ago, when was the Galician accident?
531.34s - 534.34s |  It was 10 years ago, right?
534.34s - 542.34s |  They had a huge accident in Spain, too, where kind of lots of people died
542.34s - 546.34s |  because there was a misconfiguration between other factors.
546.34s - 549.34s |  There was a misconfiguration in the ASFA system,
549.34s - 560.62s |  so it could be not completely avoidable but less difficult to fix.
560.62s - 562.62s |  So we have these beacons.
562.62s - 565.62s |  These are the beacons that we have in the ASFA systems,
565.62s - 570.62s |  and these beacons sit on the railway,
570.62s - 573.62s |  and you can receive it by the capture.
573.62s - 580.37s |  So I have to work here.
580.37s - 586.87s |  So we have the beacon in the black box.
586.87s - 588.87s |  The wood doesn't count.
588.87s - 590.87s |  It's only the black box.
590.87s - 597.87s |  And inside this black box is a coil and a capacitor.
597.87s - 602.87s |  So we have a coil-capacitor circuit in closed loop.
602.87s - 610.87s |  No batteries, no voltage here, no batteries, no IC power.
610.87s - 616.87s |  So it's a passive device that is powered by the train
616.87s - 620.87s |  when the train passes along the track.
620.87s - 632.87s |  So we have here a very simple circuit with a coil and capacitors in parallel.
632.87s - 643.87s |  So I'm going to explain why this setup makes sense.
643.87s - 648.87s |  The technology behind the ASFA system is based on induction.
648.87s - 654.87s |  As you can find in your kitchen or in your phone charger,
654.87s - 660.87s |  wireless, of course, and even in RFID tags and so on.
660.87s - 666.87s |  But it's a very primitive kind of RFID tag.
666.87s - 670.87s |  Very primitive because there is no data transmit,
670.87s - 674.87s |  but it's only an aspect transmit.
674.87s - 679.43s |  Where do I want to see that?
679.43s - 683.43s |  It's in Spanish because it's open source.
683.43s - 690.43s |  All of this is publicly available if you Google that.
690.43s - 696.43s |  So a guy put this on the Internet.
696.43s - 701.43s |  Oh, I have to repair an ASFA tester.
701.43s - 708.43s |  An ASFA tester is a device that will be on the train path.
708.43s - 717.43s |  So you put this device above the beacon
717.43s - 722.43s |  and this device reads what kind of beacon it is.
722.43s - 725.43s |  So we have two coils here.
725.43s - 728.43s |  The two circles are two coils.
729.43s - 735.43s |  One coil is for transmit to give power to the beacon
735.43s - 738.43s |  and the other one is to receive power.
738.43s - 749.99s |  So what about if you use a circuit with a coil and capacitor
749.99s - 756.07s |  to emulate a beacon?
756.07s - 761.07s |  We could replicate a beacon and we could make a fake beacon.
761.07s - 767.07s |  So we require wire and a capacitor.
767.07s - 768.07s |  That's all.
768.07s - 769.07s |  It's enough.
769.07s - 772.07s |  It's enough for that.
772.07s - 779.07s |  So I think this is the most important slide here in this talk
779.07s - 786.07s |  because it represents very well how the setup is configured.
786.07s - 790.07s |  So we have the beacon itself in the DAC
790.07s - 794.07s |  and the beacon is, as you can see in the diagram,
794.07s - 798.07s |  we have a coil and a capacitor.
798.07s - 800.07s |  We represented a variable capacitor
800.07s - 805.07s |  because you can change the capacitance of the circuit
805.07s - 807.07s |  to change the aspect.
807.07s - 811.07s |  For example, if I want to transmit a red light,
811.07s - 815.07s |  we change the capacitance.
815.07s - 819.07s |  This beacon is by default in red signal.
819.07s - 826.07s |  It's the safest symbol that is red light, obviously.
826.07s - 835.07s |  So if we put a smart current temporarily to that symbol,
835.07s - 838.07s |  we can change the aspect.
838.07s - 845.07s |  So we only need power only to change from red to another symbol.
845.07s - 849.07s |  For example, green or yellow.
849.07s - 856.07s |  And the other setup here is in the train part.
856.07s - 864.07s |  So we have a capture that has two items.
864.07s - 871.07s |  We have a 111 kilohertz generator, IEC power.
871.07s - 875.07s |  So we can generate a frequency of that kind
875.07s - 880.07s |  with also a coil and a capacitor.
880.07s - 889.07s |  At the same time, the train has put together another device
889.07s - 898.07s |  that receives that power by inductance coupling.
898.07s - 901.07s |  Oh, I've seen 111 kilohertz.
901.07s - 905.07s |  That's okay. It's working.
905.07s - 914.42s |  But when the train passes...
914.42s - 918.42s |  When the train passes through...
918.42s - 923.42s |  When the train passes through the beacon,
923.42s - 928.42s |  an inductive coupling is produced between
928.42s - 932.42s |  the first coil that transmits 111 kilohertz,
932.42s - 935.42s |  the second coil that receives that signal,
935.42s - 938.42s |  and the third coil that is on the tracks
938.42s - 944.42s |  that modifies the inductance coupling to another frequency,
945.42s - 949.42s |  to the frequency that this configures that beacon.
949.42s - 955.42s |  It's easy to understand. Yes? Okay?
955.42s - 959.95s |  It's okay.
959.95s - 964.95s |  So, that's our desk.
964.95s - 969.95s |  We have the transmitter part.
969.95s - 972.95s |  Firstly, to make the fake beacon,
972.95s - 977.95s |  we need the framework like Java, Javascript, and so on.
977.95s - 982.95s |  So, this is our code editor.
982.95s - 987.95s |  So we need a framework to test the beacon
987.95s - 992.95s |  at that point that was not existing.
992.95s - 995.95s |  So, firstly we need a transmitter.
995.95s - 998.95s |  So, we set up a coil and a capacitor
998.95s - 1006.95s |  that is suitable to transmit power at 111 kilohertz.
1006.95s - 1008.95s |  Okay?
1008.95s - 1012.95s |  We use an AliExpress device called NanoVNeA
1012.95s - 1018.95s |  that is a vector network analyzer that you can buy.
1018.95s - 1021.95s |  It's cheap.
1022.95s - 1026.95s |  You can see the impedance, the inductance, the resonance, and so on.
1026.95s - 1032.52s |  So, this is the receiver part.
1032.52s - 1035.52s |  It's more or less the same setup,
1035.52s - 1042.52s |  but instead of transmitting power, it receives power.
1042.52s - 1053.52s |  So, it's fine tuned to capture frequencies from 50 kilohertz to 111.
1053.52s - 1061.52s |  So, it's very wide range to capture all the aspects of any beacon.
1061.52s - 1070.52s |  So, we have a signal generator, also from AliExpress.
1070.52s - 1076.52s |  And we receive that signal on the receiver part.
1076.52s - 1080.52s |  So, we already have the tester.
1080.52s - 1087.08s |  So, we need to make the beacon itself.
1087.08s - 1094.08s |  So, what if two people here or not here could replicate this beacon
1094.08s - 1098.08s |  and show it to you right now?
1098.08s - 1099.08s |  Shall we?
1099.08s - 1101.08s |  I'll pay you for that.
1101.08s - 1104.94s |  It's my turn.
1104.94s - 1106.94s |  The tester.
1110.94s - 1116.94s |  Well, the most important part of this tester we did is a can of morteruero de cuenca,
1116.94s - 1118.94s |  which is...
1118.94s - 1122.94s |  They are laughing because morteruero de cuenca means meat in a can.
1122.94s - 1123.94s |  Okay?
1123.94s - 1129.94s |  So, it's what helped us to have this coil or setup.
1129.94s - 1131.94s |  And it works perfectly.
1131.94s - 1136.94s |  So, meat in a can may be a key factor in this tester.
1136.94s - 1137.94s |  Okay?
1137.94s - 1141.94s |  And the second part is the beacon.
1141.94s - 1142.94s |  Okay.
1142.94s - 1149.94s |  So, we could replicate the beacon by following the calculus that you can do with data
1149.94s - 1158.94s |  that is completely, I repeat, completely available on the Internet in open source information.
1158.94s - 1164.94s |  So, this one is the L5 as you saw.
1164.94s - 1165.94s |  One second.
1165.94s - 1170.94s |  Here, this one is the L5, the yellow sign.
1170.94s - 1178.94s |  And for legal reasons, we cannot show you here on this stage the proof that this works.
1178.94s - 1184.94s |  But outside of the stage, anyone that comes and asks will have the answer.
1184.94s - 1185.94s |  Okay?
1189.21s - 1194.21s |  We don't want to go to jail, but we like to brag about our things.
1194.21s - 1195.21s |  Yeah, okay.
1206.07s - 1208.07s |  Hacking.
1208.07s - 1222.91s |  So, as a computer engineer, I have to make the work of the electronic engineer here.
1222.91s - 1229.91s |  So, if any electronic engineer here can come to explain that, and we rest here.
1229.91s - 1237.91s |  So, if there is any electronic engineer in the house, is there any electronic engineer here?
1237.91s - 1239.91s |  Just raise your hand.
1239.91s - 1246.23s |  Okay, we are sorry in advance.
1246.23s - 1265.23s |  So, when you put current in an inductor and capacitive circuit, it's like magic, you know.
1265.23s - 1266.23s |  It's magic.
1266.23s - 1269.23s |  Indeed, it's black magic here.
1269.23s - 1273.23s |  Because when you put a set of frequencies,
1273.23s - 1283.23s |  So, the circuit behaves differently according to the frequency that you put in the circuit.
1283.23s - 1289.23s |  We, the computing engineers here, we couldn't understand this.
1290.23s - 1303.23s |  The circuit behaves as a capacitive, as a virtual capacitor, as a virtual resistance, or as a virtual inductor.
1303.23s - 1306.23s |  It's okay, eh? That's cool.
1306.23s - 1314.23s |  You don't get rid of virtual devices even if you are an electronic engineer.
1315.23s - 1326.23s |  The point here is to design a circuit that resonates at a very specific and very narrow set of frequencies.
1326.23s - 1336.23s |  Indeed, you need to resonate at a very narrow interval of frequencies.
1336.23s - 1345.23s |  So, as you see, as Gabs explained to you, we need a circuit that resonates at a certain set of frequencies
1345.23s - 1350.23s |  to make the train think that this is a symbol.
1350.23s - 1358.23s |  It's a real symbol, a red light, a green light, a yellow, even a yellow and green light.
1358.23s - 1360.23s |  That exists.
1360.23s - 1364.23s |  It's trainiac stuff, don't worry.
1365.23s - 1370.23s |  So, we need that, but how do you do that?
1370.23s - 1372.23s |  We are computing engineers.
1372.23s - 1385.24s |  So, we need to wire, by public photos and seeing the device in real world,
1385.24s - 1389.24s |  we can get the dimensions of the beacon.
1389.24s - 1394.24s |  We can guess that because there is a public documentation,
1394.24s - 1401.24s |  but they don't give you the exact details to make the beacon, obviously.
1401.24s - 1405.24s |  So, you have to guess that at some point.
1405.24s - 1411.24s |  So, guessing the dimensions of the beacon and the shape, indeed,
1412.24s - 1421.24s |  we started to wire one turn, two turns, three turns, all day long.
1421.24s - 1428.24s |  So, we asked ourselves, what am I doing with my life?
1428.24s - 1432.24s |  I could be in the swimming pool.
1432.24s - 1437.24s |  So, we end with a lot of turns and what happens now?
1437.24s - 1442.24s |  So, we tested with the nano VNA and nothing works.
1442.24s - 1449.24s |  The resonance of the circuit is very far from the target resonance.
1449.24s - 1456.24s |  So, we cut the wire and we put on the nano VNA.
1456.24s - 1462.24s |  So, we start to wire another round of turns.
1462.24s - 1470.24s |  And we saw real time how this graph moves in real time,
1470.24s - 1477.24s |  getting closer and closer and closer to the target frequency or the desired symbol.
1477.24s - 1483.24s |  So, turning and turning and messing it up and what the fuck.
1483.24s - 1487.24s |  So, we achieved one symbol.
1487.24s - 1498.62s |  So, indeed, this is not a real coil capacitor setup, but it's a double inductor setup.
1498.62s - 1506.62s |  There are two inductors put together and taking advantage of the parasitic capacitance.
1506.62s - 1514.62s |  We have a virtual NC circuit that makes the same work at the real device.
1514.62s - 1518.62s |  We know that the real device is one coil and one capacitor.
1518.62s - 1528.62s |  But this stuff is two coils put together and taking advantage of the parasitic capacitance.
1528.62s - 1533.62s |  So, this is the center frequency.
1533.62s - 1538.62s |  And less frequency, the circuit behaves as a capacitor.
1538.62s - 1543.62s |  The more frequency, the circuit behaves as an inductor.
1543.62s - 1549.62s |  So, at the very exact point, the circuit is a resistance.
1549.62s - 1562.15s |  So, this is the graph that you have to see to make sure you are doing right.
1562.15s - 1569.15s |  In order to achieve the correct resonance frequency.
1569.15s - 1580.15s |  The yellow line is the resonance that has to be just in the middle of the graph.
1580.15s - 1585.15s |  The green line is the impedance.
1585.15s - 1590.15s |  So, it has to be as low as possible at the resonant point.
1590.15s - 1593.15s |  And the other one is the standing wave radio.
1593.15s - 1603.68s |  That is how well is the energy transferred from the system to outside and backwards.
1603.68s - 1606.68s |  So, that is the device.
1606.68s - 1611.68s |  As you can see, it's very complex, very expensive.
1611.68s - 1612.68s |  And beautiful.
1612.68s - 1613.68s |  And beautiful.
1613.68s - 1617.68s |  Because it has, I think, this Amazon cardboard.
1617.68s - 1619.68s |  Thank you, Amazon.
1619.68s - 1621.68s |  Thank you, Amazon.
1621.68s - 1629.68s |  And you have to use isolated copper wire.
1629.68s - 1638.68s |  So, once we have this item, we have to put glue on the device.
1638.68s - 1639.68s |  That is very important.
1639.68s - 1646.68s |  Because you make with the fingers any movement and the frequency changes.
1646.68s - 1648.68s |  It's crazy.
1648.68s - 1649.68s |  It's crazy.
1649.68s - 1654.68s |  So, you take the device and no more works.
1654.68s - 1664.68s |  So, you have to glue the wire to make sure that the center frequency remains at the target frequency.
1664.68s - 1668.68s |  In the tester, the most important was the glue.
1668.68s - 1676.68s |  The most important thing in the tester is the can of meat.
1676.68s - 1677.68s |  Here is the glue.
1677.68s - 1681.68s |  The key component.
1681.68s - 1684.96s |  Yeah, I'm sorry.
1684.96s - 1688.96s |  I'm seeing the electronic engineering looking at us.
1688.96s - 1691.96s |  Sorry, really.
1691.96s - 1694.96s |  I have stickers for you to compensate this.
1694.96s - 1702.04s |  So, how do you know that this works?
1702.04s - 1708.04s |  Well, firstly, you have to know what to see.
1709.04s - 1713.04s |  It's a key factor.
1713.04s - 1716.04s |  You have to know that I have to see things.
1716.04s - 1726.04s |  So, in the picture on the left, we have the default frequency being received by the receiver device.
1726.04s - 1730.04s |  So, we transmit 111 kHz.
1730.04s - 1732.04s |  Okay, I'm working.
1732.04s - 1735.04s |  I'm receiving the same frequency as the train transmits.
1736.04s - 1741.04s |  That's a permanent testing that the system works.
1741.04s - 1755.04s |  So, the left one, the right one, is when you pass through a beacon.
1755.04s - 1762.04s |  So, you see another spike on the spectrum analyzer.
1762.04s - 1769.04s |  You have another spike that represents the resonant frequency of the device, of the beacon.
1769.04s - 1773.77s |  So, that works.
1773.77s - 1785.13s |  Thank you for this sincere applause.
1785.13s - 1789.13s |  So, where should I place my fake beacon?
1789.13s - 1797.13s |  Well, the official documentation already tells you where to put your device, your fake device.
1797.13s - 1799.13s |  So, that's the dimension.
1799.13s - 1811.13s |  You have to keep a distance from the rails and a certain height from the sleepers.
1811.13s - 1828.40s |  So, the most important thing is that it matches the position perfectly to make all the setup take place, the induction coupling.
1828.40s - 1838.40s |  This is not a radio frequency stuff, but it's more an inductive coupling.
1838.40s - 1848.40s |  We firstly thought that it was a radio frequency problem, but it's more like an inductive coupling, as Gabriela says to you.
1848.40s - 1857.86s |  So, what about other systems all over Europe and worldwide?
1857.86s - 1861.86s |  Well, in the UK, you have the AWS system.
1861.86s - 1863.86s |  Not powered by Amazon.
1863.86s - 1866.86s |  Not powered by Amazon.
1866.86s - 1877.86s |  Indeed, the Spanish system is the most sophisticated legacy system, because they have more symbols to transmit.
1877.86s - 1880.86s |  The UK system only has two symbols.
1880.86s - 1883.86s |  Go and stop. That's all.
1883.86s - 1887.86s |  So, you see a star in the cabin.
1887.86s - 1889.86s |  It's called the sunflower.
1889.86s - 1891.86s |  Sunflower.
1891.86s - 1896.43s |  It's okay. Not okay. That's all.
1896.43s - 1899.43s |  And this is the Indus Sea.
1899.43s - 1903.43s |  In German, it's very...
1909.43s - 1913.43s |  It has a name in German that we don't know how to spell.
1913.43s - 1919.43s |  So, let's call it Indus Sea and let's have some fun.
1919.43s - 1924.43s |  We don't want to offend German people.
1924.43s - 1931.43s |  So, there is also that kind of systems that is based on the same principle.
1931.43s - 1936.43s |  But they are not one-to-one compatible.
1936.43s - 1943.43s |  So, you will have to make your own device adjusted to that kind of setups.
1943.43s - 1952.35s |  And that is the North American system that also is based on the same principle.
1952.35s - 1960.35s |  But they are not entirely widespread on all the tracks.
1960.35s - 1963.35s |  It's an intermittent system.
1963.35s - 1970.46s |  But it's based, again, on the same principle, by induction.
1970.46s - 1976.09s |  What about new things?
1977.09s - 1979.09s |  No.
1979.09s - 1988.09s |  Well, we talk about a legacy system that was invented in the middle of the 20th century.
1988.09s - 1990.09s |  So, what about new systems?
1990.09s - 1996.09s |  We're talking about new because it was invented in the 90s.
1996.09s - 1998.09s |  Okay? Cool.
1998.09s - 2008.72s |  Well, we have the ATCS, the European Trade Control System, that is based, again, on beacons.
2008.72s - 2011.72s |  But they transmit digital data.
2011.72s - 2016.72s |  So, we will talk about this next year, maybe.
2017.72s - 2030.72s |  So, the main thing here is that all the European regions have very different systems.
2030.72s - 2037.06s |  And they thought, what about a new protocol?
2037.06s - 2046.06s |  So, we have a new protocol that covers all Europe, but it is not implemented already widespread.
2046.06s - 2051.06s |  Only in high-speed trains and very crowded lines.
2051.06s - 2054.06s |  Because it takes money, you know.
2054.06s - 2060.66s |  So, it combines beacons called Euroballis.
2060.66s - 2063.66s |  I like more beacons.
2063.66s - 2073.66s |  And they combine that system with some kind of mobile communications, changing the protocol.
2073.66s - 2076.66s |  It's called JCM-Air.
2076.66s - 2084.75s |  Air means railroad.
2084.75s - 2085.75s |  Okay.
2085.75s - 2094.75s |  So, as you have seen in the whole presentation, what we have discovered is that by inductive coupling,
2094.75s - 2101.75s |  we can reach the most of the signaling system in Spain.
2101.75s - 2111.75s |  Because they don't use this system, ATCS, in most of the railway segments.
2111.75s - 2121.75s |  So, what we have is now security problems that was, in their time, a really robust protocol.
2121.75s - 2128.75s |  Because these kinds of protocols are not being properly revised.
2128.75s - 2136.75s |  So, one of the main things that we receive when we talk about this investigation is why we are talking about this.
2136.75s - 2146.75s |  And the reason is that we want companies to revise these kinds of systems.
2146.75s - 2154.75s |  For example, we can adopt this new ATCS system.
2154.75s - 2162.75s |  This system started being quite less robust, but now it's like in level 3, developing level 3.
2162.75s - 2168.75s |  And having very good results in terms of security.
2168.75s - 2170.75s |  But it costs money.
2170.75s - 2180.75s |  And money is a key factor in the decision making of the petitions and authorities related to this.
2180.75s - 2191.75s |  So, one of the other measures that we can offer, and we are completely willing to work with authorities in that,
2191.75s - 2197.75s |  is the usage, for example, of trained drones that are being developed.
2197.75s - 2200.75s |  This one is AI generated, okay?
2200.75s - 2203.75s |  Because I didn't find the picture.
2203.75s - 2210.75s |  Italy has now quite bigger, but yet tiny, trained drones.
2210.75s - 2221.75s |  And these trained drones can be deployed through the whole railway segments to investigate or inspect the beacons.
2221.75s - 2231.75s |  Just to know if there is anything, any weird objects, for example, in the railway, or anyone has covered these beacons.
2231.75s - 2248.75s |  Because these kind of beacons, ASFA beacons, can be just shot down by putting above them a plaque, a slice of lead.
2248.75s - 2260.75s |  So, we are trying to make quite a concern and talk with our authorities to make them inspect them.
2260.75s - 2271.75s |  Another object they can use are normal drones, just surveillance and looking at these railway segments just to, again,
2271.75s - 2278.75s |  know if there is any strange objects in the railway segments.
2278.75s - 2287.75s |  And, of course, we can use testers and pass testers more frequently just to know everything is okay with the beacons.
2287.75s - 2299.75s |  Actually, we don't have to create this chaos or fear, just want to have more intensity in the inspection rounds
2299.75s - 2307.75s |  or to change these devices into more newer devices around the world.
2307.75s - 2314.75s |  Because this investigation is based on the most robust legacy system, that is the ASFA.
2315.75s - 2319.75s |  But here Amtrak is using it, UK is using it.
2319.75s - 2322.75s |  Not the same, but less robust systems.
2322.75s - 2325.75s |  And, of course, Germany, Austria, Hungary.
2325.75s - 2334.75s |  So, we can work to change this or at least to revise this to keep everyone safe around the world.
2334.75s - 2340.75s |  So, thanks everyone that helped us to get here.
2340.75s - 2353.37s |  And, of course, we are here for the questions.
2353.37s - 2356.38s |  Yes?
2362.70s - 2364.70s |  Right, thanks for the talk.
2364.70s - 2367.70s |  Very educational, funny and scary, honestly.
2367.70s - 2376.70s |  When you have a signal that can display multiple aspects, how does that relate to the meat cans that are set on the track?
2376.70s - 2381.70s |  Does it change its own resonance to reflect the current aspect on the signal?
2381.70s - 2382.70s |  Yeah, actually they do.
2382.70s - 2392.70s |  Because what differentiates one signal through the other is the state they leave the capacitor circuit in the train.
2392.70s - 2400.70s |  So, the difference between these frequencies is the aspect the operator receives inside the train.
2401.70s - 2403.94s |  Okay.
2403.94s - 2404.94s |  Okay.
2404.94s - 2412.94s |  What are the related risks or threats related with this finding that you get?
2412.94s - 2422.94s |  Mostly, beyond that, to prevent accidentality in the trains, what are the risks?
2422.94s - 2424.94s |  The risks?
2425.94s - 2432.94s |  Well, actually we started this investigation because in Spain we are in terrorist alert 4 from 5.
2432.94s - 2442.94s |  So, it's quite important because most of the biggest accidents that have happened in Spain have happened with trains.
2442.94s - 2451.94s |  Actually, we have a real difficult incident that happened on the 11th of March,
2451.94s - 2461.94s |  that marked before and after on the way that people seized the railway and the metro in Spain.
2461.94s - 2469.94s |  So, any people with the right amount of motivation and knowledge could exploit this.
2469.94s - 2475.94s |  So, we want to make a wake-up call before something like this happens
2475.94s - 2484.94s |  and make people invest more time and money to keep the safety around Spain and of course around the world,
2484.94s - 2487.94s |  because this again happens mostly everywhere.
2487.94s - 2491.19s |  So, thanks. This is really fascinating.
2491.19s - 2499.19s |  I'm curious to know if there are any other systems that the drivers rely on to make their decisions
2499.19s - 2505.19s |  about what speed to control the trains. Is it primarily these beacons that they're using for that?
2505.19s - 2510.19s |  Or is there any other input they're also using to make the judgment?
2510.19s - 2513.19s |  Sorry, I didn't hear you.
2513.19s - 2523.41s |  Is there another system?
2524.41s - 2533.41s |  The train driver has the real signals and the system is an acknowledged system
2533.41s - 2538.41s |  to make sure that the train driver has seen the right signal.
2538.41s - 2543.41s |  So, by default there is no other resource.
2543.41s - 2552.41s |  And the point here is that you could make a red signal device in the middle of the track with no lights.
2552.41s - 2554.41s |  For example.
2554.41s - 2556.41s |  Thank you.
2556.41s - 2562.22s |  More questions?
2562.22s - 2566.87s |  Thank you.
2566.87s - 2570.15s |  Thank you very much.
