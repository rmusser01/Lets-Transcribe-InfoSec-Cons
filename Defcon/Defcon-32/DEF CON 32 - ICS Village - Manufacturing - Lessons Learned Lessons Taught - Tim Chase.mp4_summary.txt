**Introduction**
- Speaker: Tim Chase
- Worked in various **Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)** and **Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs)** for **critical and vital infrastructures**
- This talk focuses on **manufacturing** and its unique security challenges

**Manufacturing Sector Overview**
- Defined by the **US government** as an **industry vertical**
- Unlike other industries, manufacturing is a **horizontal modality** supporting all other sectors
- Manufacturers are highly focused on **production and profit**, which can lead to **under-resourcing cybersecurity**

**Ransomware Threats**
- Manufacturers are a prime target for ransomware attacks due to their flat, poorly segmented networks and reliance on **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)** systems
- **Ransomware operators** target mid-level enterprises with sufficient funds but lacking sophisticated security measures
- **Global Resilience Federation (GRF)** analyzes ransomware trends, finding that manufacturing is the **most targeted industry**

**Unique Characteristics of Manufacturing Networks**
- The term **IT-OT convergence** does not apply to manufacturing as their networks were never truly separated
- Manufacturing networks are becoming **less industrial**, adopting IP-based connections and even Wi-Fi, creating new security challenges
- Security solutions must extend beyond traditional ICS environments to cloud and small manufacturer supply chains

**Path to Improvement**
- Manufacturers have a history of **innovation** and **technology adoption**, which can be leveraged to improve cybersecurity
- Executive leadership is key to driving change, recognizing risks, and meeting new compliance and regulatory requirements
- There are early signs of improvement, with a **reduction in ransomware victims** in the manufacturing sector

**Q&A**
- **Cybersecurity** will likely never be "sexy" for manufacturers, but emphasizing its business impact can drive action
- Manufacturers are starting to recognize the importance of cybersecurity and are attracting talent from more mature industries
