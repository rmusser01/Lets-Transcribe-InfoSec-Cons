**DEF CON 32 Presentation Overview**

- **Title:** DEF CON 32 - Unlocking the Gates: Hacking a Secure Industrial Remote Access Solution
- **Presenter:** Moritz Abrell
- **Event:** DEF CON
- **Focus:** Security analysis of industrial remote access solutions

**Importance of Industrial VPN Gateways**

- Enable **secure remote access** to industrial networks
- **Increased security risks** due to architecture
- Widespread use in **critical infrastructures**

**Research Goals and Methodology**

- **Security analysis** of a popular industrial remote access solution
- **Vulnerabilities exposed**: Rooting devices, bypassing hardware-based security, reverse engineering
- **Targeted device:** EVON COSI Plus by HMS

**Key Vulnerabilities Identified**

- **Custom VPN configurations**: Uploading and executing commands
- **Cross-site scripting**: Persistent vulnerability from FTP login attempts
- **Insecure cookie**: Base 64 encoded administrative password in plain text

**Exploitation Process**

- **Exploit chain:** 
  - Inject JavaScript via FTP
  - Administrator visits login page
  - Attacker retrieves administrative password
  - Upload malicious VPN configuration
  - Command execution with **root privileges**

**Firmware and Configuration Analysis**

- **Decryption of passwords**: Using hard-coded keys and reverse engineering
- **Firmware update encryption**: Analysis and reconstruction
- **Hardware Security Module (HSM)**: Examination and limitations

**Backend Communication and Authentication**

- **TLS proxy requirements**: Trusted certificates
- **Communication interception**: Alternative approach using device tools
- **Certificate signing requests**: Possibility of obtaining certificates for other devices

**Implications and Consequences**

- **VPN session hijacking**: Overwriting original device connections
- **Access to connected clients**: Potential attacks on remote desktop services
- **Scalable attack**: Disconnection of over 500,000 devices

**Conclusion and Lessons Learned**

- **Vulnerabilities reported**: Vendor patched and released a fixed firmware
- **Risks of remote access solutions**: Increased attack surface
- **Encouragement for security researchers**: Potential vulnerabilities in other solutions
