**Introduction of Speaker**  
- JBO from DC 9723, Tel Aviv, Israel  
- Jonathan Bar-Orr (JBO) presenting on macOS sandbox 

**Presentation Overview**  
- Focus on macOS sandbox and Office macros  
- Discuss sandbox escape mechanisms and generic sandbox escapes  

**Speaker Background**  
- Principal security researcher at Microsoft  
- Expertise in vulnerability research, cryptanalysis, and offensive security  

**Sandbox and Office Macros**  
- macOS sandbox enhances application security  
- Office macros as entry vectors: limited usage questioned  

**Sandbox Escape Mechanisms**  
- Historical data on Office sandbox rules  
- Launch agents and sandbox escape  

**Sandbox Escape Examples**

- 2020: Archive Utility exploit  
- 2021: Terminal app exploit  

**Sandboxing Rules and Fixes**  
- Microsoft and Apple sandboxing rule updates  
- Sandbox rule adjustments to prevent escapes  

**Sandbox Extensions and Tokens**  
- Tokens grant access to files; signed by kernel  
- Security-scoped bookmarks for persistent access  

**Sandbox Escape Challenges**  
- Hardening of macOS makes sandbox escapes difficult  
- Sandbox extensions and security cookies  

**Sandbox Escape Strategy**  
- Tokens can't persist between reboots  
- Security cookies enable persistent access  

**Sandbox Escape Exploit**  
- Manipulating keychain to control secret keys  
- Generic sandbox escape using keychain manipulation  

**Conclusion**  
- Sandbox escapes are increasingly challenging  
- Office VBA macros are safer due to sandboxing
