**Presentation Overview**
- Topic: Transition from theorized space cyber attacks to practical proof of concepts
- Focus: Demonstration of SPARTA techniques using a **man-in-the-middle attack** on ground infrastructure
- Goal: Highlight the need for enhanced cybersecurity measures in space missions

**About Randi Tinney**
- Affiliation: Aerospace Corporation
- Background: Contractor at NASA's Independent Verification and Validation Center, exploit developer, vulnerability researcher, and main developer for SPARTA framework

**SPARTA Framework**
- **Definition**: Cybersecurity framework for spacecraft and space-related systems
- **Comparison**: Similar to MITRE ATT&CK Framework but focused on space systems
- **Purpose**: Keeps commercial and government users updated on threats

**Cybersecurity Challenges in Space**
- **Perception**: Space systems are seen as untouchable
- **Reality**: Systems can be compromised through ground stations
- **Common Misconceptions**: Firewalls, air gaps, and insider threat mitigations are infallible

**Demonstrated Attacks**
- **Simple Attacks**: Man-in-the-middle, ARP spoofing
- **Serious Impacts**: Compromised telemetry and command systems
- **Jamming and Flooding**: Blocking and sending excess data to disrupt systems

**Tools and Techniques**
- **Sparta Cyber Exploiter**: Tool for man-in-the-middle attacks
- **NOSCube**: Open-source tool for realistic spacecraft system simulations

**Key Attack Scenarios**
- **Exfiltration**: Telemetry and command data capture
- **Falsification**: Altering downlinked telemetry
- **Modification**: Changing command packets on the fly
- **Rogue Ground Station**: Access without being man-in-the-middle
- **Havoc Flight Application**: Backdoor into spacecraft systems

**Defense Strategies**
- **Defense in Depth**: Importance of layered security measures
- **Countermeasures**: Detailed in SPARTA with NIST and ISO mappings
- **Encryption**: Early inclusion of bulk crypto units and space data link security

**Conclusion**
- **Awareness**: Encouraging acknowledgment of vulnerabilities
- **Resources**: Additional reading materials and links for further exploration of SPARTA and cybersecurity topics

**Final Remarks**
- **Engagement**: Open to questions and further discussion on cybersecurity in space systems.
