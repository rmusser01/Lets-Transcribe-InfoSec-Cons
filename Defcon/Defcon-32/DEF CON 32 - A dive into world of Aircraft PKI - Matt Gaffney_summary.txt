**Aircraft PKI Overview**
- **PKI in Aircraft Operations**: Used for protecting aircraft software parts and authenticating aircraft to ground networks.
- **Importance**: Essential for aviation, dealing with **Field Loadable Software (FLS)**, maintenance, and navigation databases.

**Use Cases and Methods**
- **Typical Use Cases**: Include maintenance logs, communication systems, and navigation databases.
- **Methods A, B, and C**: Various approaches to handling FLS, each with specific processes and advantages.

**PKI Processes and Regulations**
- **ATA Spec 42**: Discusses the use of certificates and smart cards for user authentication.
- **Handling FLS**: Requires verification of authenticity and integrity by regulation.
- **ARINC 645-1 Portable Data Loaders (PDLs)**: Enforce signature checking before loading onto aircraft.

**Data and Security**
- **Data Generation**: Aircraft can produce hundreds of megabytes to several gigabytes of data per flight.
- **Gate Link and VPN**: Used for secure data transfer, with certificates required for each VPN connection.

**Challenges and Solutions**
- **Post-Quantum World**: Emerging threats necessitate updates in PKI to accommodate future cryptographic challenges.
- **Smart Cards**: Offer two-factor authentication without mobile devices, enhancing security and user experience.

**Technical Insights**
- **Certificate Use**: Enforce server and application authentication, mapped to **Active Directory (AD)** identities.
- **Signing Methods**: Method A involves using smart cards; Method B involves using an **HSM (Hardware Security Module)**.

**Industry Collaboration**
- **DSWG Involvement**: Guides strategic path for standards and specification changes in the aviation industry.
- **Trust and Verification**: Strong emphasis on identity checks and certificate usage within ATA Spec 42.

**Future Considerations**
- **Post-Quantum Threats**: Aircraft lifespans and regulatory challenges make adapting to quantum-resistant algorithms crucial.
- **Inventory and Testing**: Operators advised to inventory PKI use cases and prepare for future algorithm changes.
