**Introduction to AppSec Program Maturity**

- Speaker: Tanya Jenka, also known as SheHacksPurple
- Focus: Maturing Application Security (AppSec) programs
- Experience: Worked with over 400 companies on AppSec programs
- Goal: Provide practical steps to improve security posture

**Common AppSec Program Models**

- **Model 1: Pen Test Focused**
  - Companies conduct one or two pen tests yearly
  - Issues: High cost, poor coverage, lack of developer support
  - Improvement Steps: Secure coding training, using free tools, creating guidelines, consolidating code, and threat modeling

- **Model 2: Tools-Centric Approach**
  - Reliance on tools like SAST and DAST
  - Issues: Underutilized tools, inconsistent programs, and lack of bug fixes
  - Improvement Steps: Hiring diverse AppSec teams, reassessing tools, providing support, managing incidents

- **Model 3: Over-Tooling and Governance**
  - Extensive tool usage with strict governance
  - Issues: High costs, slow innovation, poor communication between security and development teams
  - Improvement Steps: Implementing security champions programs, making tools efficient, examining APIs, threat modeling, and continuous scanning

**Improvement Strategies Across Models**

- **General Recommendations:**
  - Emphasize **secure coding training** and free resources
  - Encourage consolidation and standardization within development teams
  - Promote positive cultural change through advocacy programs
  - Ensure all team members are aware of incident response processes

- **Budget-Friendly Adjustments:**
  - Utilize free tools and resources for training and code scanning
  - Establish simple security guidelines and requirements
  - Share incident information to raise awareness among developers

- **Advanced and Budget-Intensive Adjustments:**
  - Invest in an AppSec professional and better SAST tools
  - Ensure **complete rollout** of purchased tools
  - Establish company-wide **secret management** and continuous scanning protocols
