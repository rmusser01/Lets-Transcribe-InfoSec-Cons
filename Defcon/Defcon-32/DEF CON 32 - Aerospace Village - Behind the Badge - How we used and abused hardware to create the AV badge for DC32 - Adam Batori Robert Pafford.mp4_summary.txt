**Event Introduction**
- Thank you for attending.
- Apologies for the delay.
- Excited to discuss the **AV badge** creation for **DC32**.

**Project Background**
- The **Aerospace Village** had a long-standing idea to create an **ADS-B receiver** on a badge.
- The receiver would work without a network connection, utilizing **Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B)**, a protocol important for aviation safety.

**ADS-B Protocol**
- **ADS-B**: Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast.
- Transmitted between airplanes, ground stations, and satellites.
- Provides data like call signs, flight numbers, ICAO addresses, and altitude.

**Badge Design and Implementation**
- **SDRs (Software-Defined Radios)** like the **RTL-SDR** are commonly used for ADS-B signal reception.
- The protocol is simple to demodulate and decode.
- **Manchester encoding** is used for data bits.

**Challenges and Innovations**
- **SDR chips** are expensive; too costly for a badge.
- **Log-amp architecture** is utilized for receiving ADS-B, using a fast RF power level meter.

**Technical Details**
- **Receive Chain**: Amplifies and filters RF spectrum to extract the 1090 megahertz slice.
- **Signal Demodulation**: Utilizes an RF power meter and converts to a baseband level output.

**Hardware and Software Integration**
- Used a composite video signal amplifier and anti-aliasing filter to save costs.
- The **Allwinner T113 SoC** is used for Linux components, lacking fast ADCs for ADS-B demodulation.

**Reverse Engineering Efforts**
- Reverse-engineered undocumented registers to disable filters and access ADC raw samples.
- Achieved proof of concept by receiving ADS-B preamble and data packet as raw samples.

**Badge Specifications**
- Runs **full mainline Linux 6.6**.
- Features a custom **40 by 40 circular display**.
- Powered by dual Cortex-A7 cores and a **HiFi 4 DSP** for demodulation.

**Additional Features**
- **128 MB DDR3 SD-RAM**, 8 GB VMMC storage.
- Integrated **GPS and Wi-Fi**.
- Custom RF and PCB antennas implemented.

**Development Challenges**
- **USB-C** and **AXP2585 battery management chip** posed significant development challenges.
- Reverse engineering the HiFi4 DSP required extensive work to enable **ADS-B processing**.

**Conclusion**
- Despite initial challenges, the badge was successfully developed.
- Acknowledgment of the complex development process and readiness to discuss further with interested parties.
