  "description": "Since the first car hit the road, manufacturers have been obsessed with safety. But hey, as AI wisely points out, determining the absolute 'safest' car can be as subjective as trying to decide on the best pizza topping! So, we decided to shift gears\u2026 into the world of car manufacturers' (application) security.\n\nIn this talk, get ready for a wild ride as we unveil the security findings from our research, affecting at least eleven major car manufacturers. Buckle up, folks, because your favorite brand might be on our list\u2014along with your personal info!\n\nBring popcorn to watch some proof-of-concept videos.\n\nWith this talk we aim to demonstrate:\n\nthat modern Web Applications are still affected by old/traditional vulnerabilities,\nhow security issues can be chained together to build real attacks/demonstrate impact,\nhighlight a common pattern on running unpatched third-party software,\nhow organizations benefit from a responsible disclosure policy.",

4.18s - 8.94s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Okay, first of all, thank you for joining. It's a great pleasure to be here today
9.86s - 12.94s |  I'm not sure how many of you have a driving license, but I
13.46s - 17.74s |  Kindly ask you to fasten your seatbelts because this is gonna be a quick one
18.74s - 22.70s |  My name is Paul Silva. I'm a security researcher and pen tester at chart 49
23.42s - 27.50s |  But I've started as a software developer. I did it for more than 15 years
27.50s - 30.50s |  What was plenty of time to do all sort of mistakes?
30.98s - 36.46s |  I'm also co-author of something that you may have heard about like the last BPI security top 10
37.42s - 41.78s |  But the topic here today is another one with us. We we have David
43.10s - 49.06s |  Yeah, so my name is David Sopas. I'm a security researcher for a long time
50.14s - 55.22s |  more than 15 years, I especially like research and
55.78s - 56.82s |  And
56.82s - 61.06s |  Focusing also on I'll have open testing. I usually I
62.14s - 65.58s |  Already spoke on events like RSA
66.14s - 72.86s |  Defcon this is my first time here in Vegas because the first time I spoke on on Defcon
72.86s - 79.54s |  It was unsafe mode. So I was at home not that fun, but still I did the shots with my friends
79.54s - 81.38s |  So shut the knob
81.42s - 86.70s |  And besides and props to besides Lisbon which some guys over here I
87.22s - 91.86s |  Did some API security methodology. I don't know if you guys know it mind API
92.46s - 94.46s |  It's part of my open source work
94.98s - 96.98s |  And that's it. Let's start
98.54s - 104.34s |  Before some of the work that we the research that we were presenting I
105.02s - 107.62s |  Would like to say that this is not
108.14s - 113.78s |  We will not teach you how to act web applications or APIs all the targets
114.50s - 120.66s |  manufacturers you presented have a bug bounty program responsible disclosure program or whatever, so
122.10s - 123.70s |  This is
123.70s - 130.70s |  Everything was reported to the organizations. Some of them were like late to respond but in the end we
130.70s - 132.66s |  We did it
132.66s - 140.82s |  We'll focus this presentation with nine brands. I hope that at least
141.94s - 146.02s |  One of them. It's your your car manufacturer
147.50s - 149.58s |  But let's start with this one
150.10s - 155.58s |  I don't know if you know this this brand, but we will not mention it. It's a vulnerable
156.38s - 161.98s |  outdated component, but before that I would like to tell you a little bit about the
162.70s - 164.82s |  API
164.82s - 170.10s |  In the API world, which means you have a lot of API architectures
170.10s - 173.74s |  I'm talking about the most popular ones like rest graph QL
174.94s - 177.98s |  RPC you name it all of them
178.74s - 185.02s |  Make sense to to mention that most of the abilities that were present was focused on these architectures
186.02s - 188.02s |  Open
189.46s - 191.58s |  API is one of the most common ones
192.58s - 194.58s |  Usually it's like
195.02s - 196.86s |  Connected in a way to
196.86s - 200.94s |  Swagger, I hope anyone knows swagger. I believe everyone knows
201.78s - 203.50s |  so
203.50s - 205.50s |  the problem is that
206.70s - 213.26s |  It helps out developers and even pen testers in researchers because it documents everything and
214.10s - 220.62s |  You it will help you not to make any mistakes and leave the documentation open, but
221.54s - 223.50s |  one of the things that
223.50s - 227.18s |  Because usually individuals like shiny things and web interfaces
227.74s - 231.10s |  Swagger UI is one of them. It's the most popular one and
231.82s - 236.50s |  Usually is left public of available. This is the example of
237.14s - 242.78s |  Swagger pet store, but like every software it also has vulnerabilities
242.90s - 244.90s |  so
244.94s - 247.14s |  Especially the vulnerability from
248.50s - 253.02s |  3.71 which is the cross-site scripting which allows you to put
255.22s - 257.02s |  Specially crafted
257.02s - 258.26s |  JSON
258.26s - 265.58s |  File that you can control and put cross-site scripting payload and you can do a lot of a lot of stuff with that
266.58s - 268.98s |  This is the classic example of a
269.62s - 274.06s |  Swagger UI which is presented on the brand that I showed you
274.70s - 276.70s |  this is come to a reminder that
277.46s - 279.46s |  if you use
280.22s - 283.62s |  or use third-party software, please
284.42s - 291.58s |  Keep it updated because it can be a way that attackers can achieve to get into your organization
293.22s - 295.22s |  This brand which is
296.14s - 297.14s |  I
297.14s - 303.46s |  I'm guessing nobody here has this brand in their garage if so kudos
304.42s - 308.38s |  It has a vulnerable outdated component this time. It's not
309.98s - 315.02s |  Swagger but we we found that a subdomain on this company
316.06s - 318.06s |  have
318.14s - 325.42s |  Immediately cuts all attention because we saw form and we like okay form let's try to approach this the security
325.42s - 327.42s |  research way
327.70s - 333.38s |  We immediately went to the inspector because it's faster than trying to do some proxy stuff
333.98s - 340.70s |  We noticed that it was a wordpress because it has a lot of tips like WP content WP plugins
340.82s - 345.22s |  You can use for example for enumeration tools like WP scan
345.22s - 349.02s |  But in this case, we immediately saw that the plugin that we wanted
349.62s - 353.66s |  And we could see if any vulnerability could be in place
354.26s - 355.98s |  And it was
355.98s - 358.66s |  this subdomain from from this manufacturer
359.42s - 360.90s |  uses
360.90s - 362.90s |  Use double three total cash
363.62s - 370.22s |  it was a vulnerable version and this was very cool for us to test especially for
371.98s - 378.78s |  These manufacturer that I don't know if they could like offers a good reward like a car
379.78s - 382.34s |  This is the CVE from the plugin
383.06s - 385.06s |  It's very cool. So it's vulnerable to
385.62s - 389.14s |  You could read arbitrary files from the subdomain
390.02s - 396.70s |  And the main goal here. Okay, let's to create the POC and to respect the responsible disclosure program
396.70s - 403.90s |  Let's like grab WP config and drop the database details and tell them way. This is the your database
403.98s - 408.18s |  Okay, so at least the credentials and that's what we did
408.26s - 410.26s |  so this is the
410.66s - 415.62s |  Exploit the first thing that we wanted to know and to play around with the file path
416.02s - 422.70s |  Was to see what was the operating system running. So we do the curl, but the full
423.90s - 430.30s |  URL the the plug-in place the vulnerable parameter was which was the subscriber URL
430.46s - 435.30s |  So we put etc issue just to see if it's it's running Linux and it was
435.74s - 442.46s |  The the response it's below so it's Ubuntu not latest version, but it doesn't matter but they give us
442.82s - 449.98s |  With this operating system gave us clues to understand the path and the configuration files for other stuff
450.02s - 456.06s |  So moving forward. So now we noticed that is running virtual hosts
456.06s - 458.14s |  So we did the past golf
458.46s - 463.30s |  It's like going through to see how we can get the full path
464.06s - 466.06s |  Internal path for
466.22s - 467.98s |  the WordPress
467.98s - 473.66s |  Installation and get the WP config sites enabled. We didn't we we needed to know the
474.54s - 477.90s |  Domain itself. So we tried it and in the end after
478.66s - 481.98s |  Like experience because sites enable usually it's sub domain
481.98s - 486.54s |  We tried that on the subscriber URL and we got to document roots
486.54s - 490.50s |  Which was this one and with that we just try it
491.30s - 494.50s |  Just WP config and we got to database from this
495.18s - 496.46s |  high-level
496.46s - 500.98s |  Manufacturer that in the end decided to tell us good work
501.74s - 503.74s |  And it fix it
503.94s - 506.30s |  another brand, this is my favorite because
507.30s - 510.42s |  It's a brand that I'm very close to
511.34s - 515.58s |  And we found out some cool stuff like bola reflected
516.30s - 518.30s |  Cross-site scripting and again
518.70s - 520.70s |  components that are vulnerable but
521.46s - 526.10s |  It sees it's very hard sometimes to get VINs from cars as you can see
526.98s - 528.82s |  Usually it's placed on the windshield
528.82s - 534.74s |  But you can also try other state out other things like going to Google and search for VINs
535.34s - 537.34s |  And we did that
538.38s - 542.30s |  Not only that we decided okay, let's see if we can create
543.30s - 544.50s |  on
544.50s - 546.74s |  this manufacturer account dashboard
549.14s - 554.86s |  Add these cars without any confirmation. So we create a persona, which is g1
555.62s - 561.94s |  And we added a bunch of cars like you can see on the picture. Sorry. It's in Portuguese
561.94s - 569.22s |  We are from Portugal. So it's automatic translated, but it's it's it works in every language. So we added these cars
569.98s - 573.46s |  on other brands and I can I can tell you that
574.50s - 577.58s |  Like on the nine manufacturers that we tried
578.26s - 580.26s |  at least three
580.58s - 584.54s |  You need to confirm on the infotainment talk inside the car
585.02s - 591.54s |  To have the car added to your dashboard account on the car on the car website in this case
591.74s - 596.14s |  like you can add it and get information from this is the
598.18s - 602.30s |  Information you added without any interaction from the user inside the car
602.38s - 608.74s |  So that's a big issue some brands tells you that no this it's normal, but you can see in
609.54s - 611.54s |  After a while, that's it's not
611.66s - 616.46s |  so on these information that we get on do you why dashboard
617.10s - 621.60s |  You know that your you have an outdated car, for example
622.62s - 626.54s |  You can see the versions from the infotainment system
628.06s - 629.98s |  You can see
629.98s - 633.78s |  Issues related to guarantees if you paid for
636.14s - 640.26s |  Years for to have more guarantee on your vehicle
641.30s - 647.02s |  Also more information that what you need to do when you go to an inspection car
648.74s - 655.14s |  But one thing that we noticed is that is that we could get more information on the API
655.34s - 659.04s |  That was not present on the UI and this is cool
659.24s - 661.24s |  okay, so
661.36s - 666.80s |  We try that a in by the way with this endpoint, which is already fixed. So disclaimer
668.56s - 674.12s |  We can you don't need even to be authenticated this is like public information
675.88s - 679.22s |  On the API we can get over meter fuel
679.36s - 685.20s |  But is battery status if it's electric or life tire pressure for each wheel
685.52s - 689.36s |  For each tire and that's after you can see the screenshot on the API
689.36s - 693.80s |  This information is not present on the UI by the way, so we get that
694.64s - 696.64s |  It will be cool like to get
697.96s - 705.12s |  For example on this manufacturer for a friend and you can go check out the is been and bet with him
705.12s - 706.52s |  okay, if I
706.52s - 714.04s |  Know the exactly number of kilometers. That's your car as you buy me a beer. So this is win-win. So
716.20s - 721.52s |  Other information, I think that's that's another end point that we found using
722.52s - 729.88s |  Our intersection only using a proxy was like type of vehicle which is in the car. Not that relevant
731.00s - 738.52s |  So model one thing and I put two smileys on Wi-Fi hotspot. Very cool. I love cars with Wi-Fi hotspot
739.12s - 741.88s |  Also, if it's connected to the Internet even better
742.64s - 747.96s |  And as you can see we can do a lot of things especially with Wi-Fi hotspot
749.48s - 752.00s |  We can wiggle wiggle so I
753.04s - 755.04s |  got the hotspot from the
755.56s - 759.48s |  Sorry, the broadcast MAC address. I grabbed it
760.04s - 764.92s |  And go to wiggle and then we get location from the vehicles
765.44s - 771.08s |  And that's very cool because I'm talking about millions of these manufacturer
771.08s - 776.68s |  But it works also for other brands. So this is like crazy
780.08s - 784.60s |  Firmware update is something that we still like a work in progress
786.16s - 793.00s |  Because on this specific request you get information from firmware, but not only that we can download it
793.92s - 799.80s |  Unpack it and what we did is just I mounted on my operating system
799.84s - 803.84s |  I noticed what was the operating system running on the infotainment
803.84s - 811.52s |  It was armaments, but I didn't check for more information so far. I was focused on the API stuff. So I move forward
812.68s - 815.80s |  Recalls, this is something that the manufacturer was like
816.64s - 819.00s |  Tell me that this was an acceptable risk
819.68s - 823.28s |  Again, I don't understand why but I will explain that later
824.28s - 831.28s |  The recalls it's something that the information that it comes is very juicy because especially, you know
831.28s - 833.28s |  if the car was like
834.12s - 839.52s |  Have problems with something and get information about that. But not only that
840.32s - 847.28s |  we noticed that one of the fields returning on the response or this API request was the description part and
848.12s - 849.80s |  it was
849.80s - 856.84s |  Maybe used by an operator a mechanical part. I don't know. I don't know who uses this this this field because
857.80s - 861.12s |  most of the PYY information that we got was
861.92s - 863.92s |  added to this field, so I
864.56s - 866.56s |  find out something like
867.36s - 874.36s |  Please return the car to the home or to the owner at address with his phone and everything. So
875.24s - 877.24s |  this is like
877.48s - 883.36s |  Public information according to the this manufacturer, but it's you can see name
884.36s - 888.12s |  location of the the owner of the car and everything I
889.68s - 893.48s |  Communicated that to the manufacturer. He told me it's normal. So
894.20s - 895.32s |  maybe
895.32s - 901.88s |  It's it's kind of weird to receive sometimes this this kind of responses, but okay, so what?
904.64s - 906.64s |  With all this information together
907.24s - 910.56s |  We can do a lot of stuff. Okay, we will data we can track devices
911.16s - 914.76s |  to pinpoint locations we can place for example some
915.88s - 920.12s |  antennas on specific spots and try to track vehicles
921.44s - 924.40s |  Analyzing over meter. For example, you you can create
925.04s - 930.80s |  You can know routines from from the the the habits from the victim for example
931.44s - 935.64s |  Insights from from everything how much fuel and you can calculate
936.44s - 944.40s |  When the the person needs to go refuel or something like that a lot of stuff recall information gives you PYY information
944.40s - 946.40s |  so it's it's
946.52s - 953.92s |  It's crazy. But yeah, and by the way, yeah outdated components again, but not only one
954.64s - 958.28s |  if he's like loathing it takes a while because it's
959.32s - 961.32s |  Doesn't work. Okay, it's
961.92s - 963.44s |  This is all for
963.44s - 967.71s |  the same manufacturer halfway and
970.67s - 972.67s |  Still but
973.35s - 975.35s |  That's it
975.87s - 983.59s |  They control the documentation and the third-party software very well, so I think that's it I think to Paul
985.07s - 990.83s |  Okay from now on it's with me I believe the point here we this is not a full assessment on car manufacturers
990.83s - 993.35s |  We are not trying to assess car safety
993.87s - 1000.51s |  This was like a free time to assess how car manufacturers handle their digital asset security, so
1001.11s - 1007.59s |  We were looking for a few bugs that we could chain together and prove them the impact. So this is why you're
1008.55s - 1012.23s |  You're gonna see a lot cross-site scripting that we can chain with something else
1012.83s - 1016.35s |  And prove them the impact and get the system patch patched
1016.99s - 1020.71s |  So another manufacturer, I'm not sure how many of you are familiar
1021.55s - 1026.55s |  With the return URI query string perimeter, but when I see one I get excited
1027.19s - 1032.79s |  Probably I'm gonna get an open redirect, but then I have an additional feeling
1032.79s - 1038.83s |  maybe I can get the cross-site scripting which is even better and all we have to do is change the URI scheme and
1039.91s - 1045.67s |  change from HTTP or HTTPS to JavaScript and we get a cross-site scripting easily and
1046.67s - 1051.03s |  Chances are that we can access cookies or local storage using our
1052.11s - 1054.11s |  cross-site scripting and
1054.23s - 1058.99s |  Probably the ALT token is in there and we can use it to exfiltrate the token
1058.99s - 1062.87s |  So this is how we prove the the impact here. It's a quick demo
1063.55s - 1065.79s |  So you can use it on a phishing
1066.87s - 1068.15s |  email
1068.15s - 1074.63s |  With the malicious payload and as soon as as soon as the victim logins we get the ALT token
1074.63s - 1081.51s |  So this way they it's not only a cross-site scripting that probably no one wants are willing to fill to fix
1082.19s - 1089.63s |  There's a there's the impact here to exfiltrate PII and this is a bigger deal for the manufacturer
1091.91s - 1099.19s |  But usually you also find let's call it less interesting stuff like click jacking or UI redressing
1100.19s - 1106.43s |  If you're familiar with it or not what we have on the screen
1107.99s - 1115.63s |  Are the same but there's some red fields and those fields we are loading the login form on our one domain attacker.com and
1116.83s - 1121.83s |  The red ones are fields that we put on top of the the legit login form
1121.83s - 1124.71s |  So this is why redressing is how the attack works
1124.71s - 1127.79s |  It's not that fancy and probably no one is gonna fix
1128.31s - 1133.51s |  UI redressing as long as you have you can prove the impact it it may have and
1134.23s - 1142.11s |  Chances are this is just an hypothesis that the same the same company or organization has a subdomain
1143.59s - 1147.39s |  Pointing to an AWS cloud front and when you request
1148.23s - 1153.67s |  Some resources from it you realize it comes from S3. Not sure whether you're familiar with S3
1153.91s - 1155.83s |  It's a cloud storage
1155.83s - 1163.05s |  You can put there. They are called buckets. You can put there. Whatever you want. One of the features is hosting static websites
1164.79s - 1166.71s |  But as
1166.71s - 1169.43s |  Amazon and S3 permissions are not that easy and
1170.55s - 1175.63s |  Quite often we choose to go with the star. We allow everything to everyone and
1177.07s - 1180.63s |  S3 has a public API rest API. You can read the docs online
1181.39s - 1184.19s |  And chances are that we can write to the bucket
1184.47s - 1190.43s |  I'm not saying that that was the case, but chances are you can write to the bucket and upload whatever you want and
1191.27s - 1196.35s |  If you have a UI redressing issue, maybe you can even deploy the login form
1197.43s - 1199.15s |  deploy the
1199.15s - 1201.15s |  malicious login form on their own
1201.67s - 1208.63s |  Subdomain and this is how it would potentially look like to exfiltrate credentials
1209.07s - 1215.99s |  So you can upload whatever you want to a public S3 or at least internet facing
1216.55s - 1218.19s |  S3
1218.19s - 1219.27s |  buckets
1219.27s - 1224.31s |  Then you get your UI redressing page deployed on the subdomain
1225.15s - 1230.19s |  The victims fill the form and you get the credentials on your on your own server
1231.47s - 1234.23s |  This is exactly what we have in this demo. So
1235.23s - 1239.43s |  With the impact proved they they fixed it
1240.35s - 1244.19s |  Otherwise probably they would look like to it like a UI redressing. No one cares
1244.95s - 1246.95s |  So let's move on to another manufacturer
1247.79s - 1253.71s |  And you may may be asking yourselves. Why didn't you fuzz to find new endpoints? We did it
1254.79s - 1255.79s |  and
1255.79s - 1257.79s |  We found something
1257.79s - 1259.11s |  called site
1259.11s - 1266.55s |  Site minder. We were not aware what site minder was and we asked shut GPT or AI you may
1267.03s - 1271.83s |  You may be missing the AI buzzword and charge a pity told us
1271.83s - 1277.39s |  It's a widely used access management and authentication solution developed by CA technologies
1277.63s - 1283.27s |  Okay, so it's a third-party software, but you have a domain pointing to it. So we did
1283.79s - 1287.87s |  What this company was supposed to do we checked for CVS?
1288.27s - 1294.19s |  One of them was a cross-site scripting on site minder so you may know where this is gonna end up
1294.71s - 1298.91s |  Just crafting a simple payload. It's an image on the username parameter
1299.75s - 1303.55s |  Running some some code some JavaScript code and you get the cross-site scripting
1304.47s - 1305.55s |  but
1305.55s - 1309.39s |  Instead of a single site minder they had tons of them
1309.39s - 1314.79s |  So tons of chances to exploit cross-site scriptings on this car manufacturer
1315.79s - 1318.47s |  So moving on to another manufacturer
1319.31s - 1321.35s |  This is the another another
1322.19s - 1324.19s |  Time when I get the 404 not found
1324.75s - 1328.99s |  My heart starts beating faster because this is again
1329.55s - 1333.31s |  AWS S3 buckets and when you get the 404 means that someone deleted
1333.79s - 1338.27s |  The buckets and buckets they the name should be unique across all AWS
1339.51s - 1344.27s |  Regions, so if the bucket was deleted, but there's still a subdomain pointing to it
1344.79s - 1351.67s |  You can create the buckets and you're gonna control you're gonna get control over the content that served on this subdomain
1351.67s - 1354.15s |  So this is a subdomain takeover technically
1354.91s - 1359.67s |  But we need to figure out in which region the bucket should be created where it was created
1360.83s - 1365.19s |  Before but you know if this is not magic you can use several tools to do it
1365.71s - 1370.31s |  Checking the DNS you get the region. It's a European Europe central
1370.43s - 1374.51s |  You just create the bucket upload the content and from that moment on you're serving
1375.15s - 1382.95s |  Content whatever you want on the on the organization subdomain. This is to be honest. This is quite common on S3
1383.47s - 1385.47s |  so
1385.55s - 1391.51s |  Keep keep watching your subdomains monitor what whatever subdomains you have buckets your assets
1392.91s - 1400.07s |  But before moving to the next manufacturer still cross-site scripting on swagger UI so you're gonna find them
1400.51s - 1403.03s |  deployed everywhere and no one cares about
1404.39s - 1407.35s |  Vulnerable non vulnerabilities on this on this software
1408.83s - 1410.83s |  So
1410.87s - 1417.99s |  Let's move move on to another manufacturer we were looking to Portia. It's not a secret here
1418.99s - 1425.07s |  We found out this website called Portia experience. We looked under the woods to understand how it worked
1425.07s - 1428.11s |  It's a single page application backed by a graph QL API
1428.55s - 1430.15s |  So this time is not rest
1430.15s - 1437.19s |  But we noticed noticed something quite strange the ALT token was included twice on the graph QL requests
1437.19s - 1440.15s |  Both on the cookies and in the authorization header
1440.87s - 1443.43s |  It depends how familiar you with you are with
1444.67s - 1452.71s |  HTTP but adding the ALT token on the the request header is a game-changer in terms of cross-site scripting if
1453.03s - 1458.91s |  The API picks the ALT token from the cookie cookies are managed by the web browser and they are
1459.43s - 1461.87s |  automatically added to the request so
1462.87s - 1466.03s |  They come up with the idea. Maybe we can exploit the cross-site
1466.95s - 1470.19s |  Request forgery. Let's see. Let's see if that happens or not
1470.63s - 1475.47s |  so do that the API should get the ALT token from the cookie instead of the
1475.83s - 1479.71s |  Authorization header and that was what was happening with the graph QL API
1480.71s - 1484.95s |  Then we need the API to be willing to fulfill requests coming from
1485.63s - 1492.27s |  Or started from another origin which the API is also willing to do so we still have some
1493.07s - 1497.11s |  cross-origin request sharing issue here misconfiguration on the API
1497.71s - 1501.55s |  But then browsers include several security features
1502.63s - 1504.71s |  namely on to protect your cookies and
1505.11s - 1511.35s |  The browser they were not willing to include the cookie on requests started from external origins
1511.63s - 1516.67s |  So it was like, okay, there's no way here. It's a dead end. But in fact
1517.55s - 1520.35s |  Cross-site scripting would make this a great a great issue
1520.71s - 1525.43s |  so instead of one we found three cross-site scriptings in different websites and
1525.79s - 1529.79s |  We decided to go with the campaigns dot Porsche comm for a phishing email
1529.79s - 1534.99s |  It sounds kind of catchy if you can offer something on a campaigns dot Porsche comm
1535.51s - 1542.79s |  So this is the vulnerable URL the parameter you should keep the integer for some reason
1543.11s - 1545.11s |  But you can then append
1545.47s - 1546.75s |  HTML
1546.75s - 1548.55s |  So this is the loader
1548.55s - 1555.19s |  We're gonna we're gonna add to the URL that we are gonna send to victims to load a JavaScript file from a remote server
1556.03s - 1562.35s |  Then we have to do some encoding because you cannot it's not that easy to manage spaces and special characters on the URL
1562.91s - 1567.87s |  And this is what's fetched from our remote server. So we're gonna do a GraphQL query
1568.63s - 1572.71s |  Fetch victims PII and exfiltrate it to the remote server
1572.91s - 1578.27s |  Then we just need to trick victims to click the URL so offer them something like a Porsche experience
1578.27s - 1581.43s |  Why not and this is how it goes
1581.43s - 1594.29s |  So we are oops we are waiting victims data so let's email mail them we get the click
1595.17s - 1597.89s |  So as you as you can see, I read the emails
1599.17s - 1605.93s |  Then I click them the links and from that moment on we get the PII on our remote server
1605.93s - 1607.93s |  Again, the point here is not
1608.45s - 1613.45s |  None of the issues here are that fancy. The point is chaining them together
1613.45s - 1618.57s |  The point is chaining them together and prove the impact and this way we get all of them fixed
1621.45s - 1624.61s |  So yes, I know you
1625.57s - 1627.57s |  so we talked about
1627.81s - 1632.57s |  Subdomain takeover. So this is another another subdomain takeover on a different manufacturer
1632.57s - 1636.65s |  But here the the issue is a bit different in this case
1637.17s - 1644.33s |  And sometimes if you want to integrate with some third party, they're gonna say point subdomain to our one
1645.13s - 1652.65s |  Domain or subdomain they create a custom subdomain so that you can point something to them. But then at some point the company
1653.65s - 1655.45s |  Gave up on the the product
1655.45s - 1662.93s |  But your your DNS record is still pointing to their their wound and if it was a bucket and they just deleted their buckets
1663.25s - 1666.25s |  We can create the bucket. That was that was the case here
1666.41s - 1672.81s |  There was a DNS record pointing to another company and the company gave up on the bucket and we created the bucket and we got
1672.93s - 1676.13s |  Our content delivered through their buckets
1677.89s - 1679.17s |  So
1679.17s - 1680.37s |  again
1680.37s - 1688.13s |  Swagger UI so if there's a big takeaway today go home and check whether your company has swagger UI deployed or any other
1688.45s - 1694.57s |  Third-party piece of software and check whether there are known vulnerabilities and patch the systems
1695.45s - 1700.05s |  So time for another one. Nothing fancy again, just a cross-site scripting
1700.65s - 1702.65s |  on swagger UI
1703.81s - 1705.81s |  So we've talked about
1706.85s - 1708.85s |  misconfigured AWS
1709.09s - 1713.57s |  S3 buckets. So here's another another use use case the same issue
1714.25s - 1716.25s |  public writable
1716.77s - 1718.01s |  S3 buckets
1718.01s - 1724.13s |  so the same thing you get your you get your own codes running on their one of their subdomains and
1724.45s - 1726.25s |  Then you can access
1726.25s - 1728.25s |  APIs and other stuff
1729.25s - 1737.41s |  Because you're running on their one subdomain, so most of the policies can be bypassed or will be bypassed this way
1738.97s - 1740.13s |  So
1740.13s - 1745.36s |  We just got our content again. We use a phishing email
1745.36s - 1751.60s |  It's I believe we ask chat GPT to write it not exactly. Give me a phishing email because
1752.12s - 1754.12s |  Otherwise we won't get it
1755.12s - 1760.16s |  But as it happened before with this simple trick we get
1761.44s - 1763.92s |  The ALF token that we can then use
1765.08s - 1767.08s |  this case I
1767.36s - 1772.12s |  Believe we got the it was PII from from the API
1772.72s - 1779.20s |  But that was not the only one issue with this manufacturer as David said you have a vehicle identification number
1779.20s - 1781.20s |  You can get them from your windshield
1781.36s - 1785.52s |  So let's call it public because anyone can get it from your car part from the car park
1785.52s - 1792.68s |  Or if you're lazy enough as you we are you go to Google you search and you get one million eight hundred and ninety
1793.88s - 1795.88s |  vehicle identification numbers and
1796.44s - 1803.20s |  Then you can add them to your to you can use the API to fetch PII drivers PII owners PII
1803.80s - 1805.80s |  There was something interesting here
1806.12s - 1810.04s |  We were not able to use the this API in point
1811.00s - 1814.08s |  Before adding them. Okay, just a few seconds
1814.88s - 1820.44s |  Before adding one car. We need to be a warner, but we can be a warner of anyone's car
1820.80s - 1822.80s |  Just pick the V in add to your account
1822.80s - 1829.68s |  You become a warner and from that moment on you can do thousands of requests to just scrape the data from the API
1832.20s - 1836.00s |  Maybe you're lucky and you're gonna get again a cross-site scripting from some
1836.72s - 1841.08s |  Redirect URI and you can do the same magic we did before
1842.80s - 1846.94s |  Okay, I'm not sure we're gonna be we're gonna have time for all of them, but those are quick
1848.24s - 1851.68s |  Let's see. If you have siteminder go home and patch it
1852.12s - 1857.88s |  We have 91 instance of siteminder in the same company. So go home and fix it
1859.00s - 1860.52s |  Very fast
1860.52s - 1863.92s |  Just to tell you you have the table with all the information
1864.60s - 1871.56s |  Organizations subscribe to vulnerability databases, of course create a safe harbor for us hackers. So that's very cool
1871.68s - 1875.28s |  Reply to our emails. It's for everyone security
1876.00s - 1880.04s |  AI won't make your assets safe, but only safer
1880.16s - 1885.40s |  That's a QR code if you want to promo on API security training, so that's it. Thank you
