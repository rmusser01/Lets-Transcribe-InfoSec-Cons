**Talk Overview**
- Discusses the evolution and understanding of cryptographic terms
- Focus on historical definitions and their relevance today
- Highlights the tradeoff between **security** and **privacy**

**Speaker's Background**
- Jeff Mann, former **NSA cryptologist**
- Involved in **NSA red team** and **pen testing** in the 90s
- Worked on early cryptographic systems and **PCI** standards

**Cryptography Basics**
- **Encryption**: More than just encoding; involves complex processes
- **Codes and Ciphers**: Historically distinct methods of message protection
  - **Codes**: Applied to words and phrases for brevity
  - **Ciphers**: Scramble individual characters or symbols

**Historical Examples**
- **Caesar Cipher**: Simple substitution used historically
- **Pigpen Cipher**: Used by Freemasons for tombstone messages
- **Navajo Code Talkers**: Utilized in WWII, remained unbroken by the enemy
- **Enigma Machine**: Broken by Polish cryptographers, secret kept until late 1980s

**Modern Cryptography**
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Same key used for both encryption and decryption
- **Public Key Cryptography**: Uses key pairs (public and private keys)
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Controversial as it allows data processing while encrypted

**Technological Evolution**
- Shift from **ComSec** to **InfoSec** with advancing tech
- Introduction of **key injectors** and encryption in devices
- **Spread Spectrum Technology**: Invented by Hedy Lamarr

**Cryptographic Literature**
- Military **Cryptanalytics Volumes** by Lambros Kalimahos and William Friedman
- Importance of understanding the original definitions and applications

**Conclusion**
- Emphasis on understanding and preserving the meanings of cryptographic terms
- Presentation of Jeff Mann's cipher wheel at the National Cryptologic Museum

**Key Takeaways**
- Importance of precise terminology in cryptography
- Evolution of cryptographic methods and their historical significance
