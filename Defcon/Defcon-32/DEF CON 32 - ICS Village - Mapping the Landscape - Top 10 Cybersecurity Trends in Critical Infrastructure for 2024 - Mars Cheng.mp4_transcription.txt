1.30s - 9.30s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 All right, so welcome to Creative Stage 2, 2.30.
9.30s - 11.70s |  Sorry, I'm so slight here.
11.70s - 15.62s |  And I'm Arshad, and I'm honored to be great here again.
15.62s - 18.18s |  I'm on behalf of ICS Village here.
18.18s - 22.02s |  And today, I'm going to present this talk
22.02s - 26.42s |  will be to mapping the landscape for the top 10 critical
26.42s - 32.22s |  infrastructure searcher rings here for 2024.
32.22s - 38.26s |  And I will say, usually, we will admit to some situation
38.26s - 40.78s |  is we know OT security is very critical.
40.78s - 44.02s |  But we don't know how real critical
44.02s - 45.38s |  in a different industry.
45.38s - 47.18s |  It's very chaotic.
47.18s - 48.50s |  We know the attacks.
48.50s - 51.94s |  We know there are many attacks, ransomware, APT attacks.
51.94s - 56.62s |  But what kinds of thinking behind of most OT operator
56.62s - 58.94s |  or OT industry CISOs?
58.94s - 61.26s |  So we do a lot of research on that.
61.26s - 63.82s |  And we want to know how we can do that.
63.82s - 65.74s |  And I'm Arshad from Taiwan.
65.74s - 69.22s |  And now, I'm the search manager of TS1 Networks.
69.22s - 72.82s |  And I also is a security director
72.82s - 74.74s |  of Association of Hacks in Taiwan.
74.74s - 76.58s |  It's a very awesome and powerful association.
76.58s - 78.74s |  And we organize many cybersecurity conference
78.74s - 80.50s |  or competition things.
80.50s - 83.22s |  And I also spoke at the main cybersecurity conference.
83.22s - 87.06s |  Also, I just finished our talk for yesterday,
87.06s - 88.90s |  Breadhead USA 2094.
88.90s - 92.34s |  So it's me here for reference.
92.34s - 94.70s |  OK, I think.
94.70s - 96.98s |  And also, so for the top 10 critical infrastructure
96.98s - 100.66s |  situation, a searcher ring here.
100.66s - 104.78s |  Before we started, we need to know the one thing first here
104.78s - 112.18s |  is we do this survey for 2023 and 2024.
112.18s - 116.82s |  And this survey, we collected many cybersecurity CISOs
116.82s - 119.46s |  in the OT industry, including the 2023
119.46s - 123.98s |  for general manufacturing, in automotive manufacturing,
123.98s - 127.10s |  pharmaceutical manufacturing, oil and gas.
127.10s - 130.54s |  And also, we also do these things in 2024.
130.54s - 133.54s |  And we increase it as a scope here.
133.54s - 136.66s |  So for the reference, we know now in 2024,
136.66s - 140.06s |  we have more higher percentage for those people
140.06s - 142.38s |  in charge of OT cybersecurity and budget
142.38s - 144.58s |  and everything on the management level.
144.58s - 149.50s |  And first, what is the top 10 for policy?
149.50s - 151.50s |  We know every country, everywhere
151.50s - 154.34s |  they know the cybersecurity for OT environment
154.34s - 155.98s |  is very important.
155.98s - 159.18s |  But how important is it for that?
159.18s - 161.62s |  So we just go through from the policy.
161.62s - 165.54s |  You will see here, from March 2023 to now,
165.54s - 167.50s |  there are many policies.
167.50s - 171.10s |  Sometimes, they were related with the OT environment
171.10s - 174.94s |  or ICS policies, or like, for example, in the EU.
174.94s - 177.90s |  Recently, yes, we have a cybersecurity that happened.
177.90s - 181.94s |  And also, in every industry, including Taiwan, Korea, Japan,
181.94s - 185.46s |  they also design there some security law or regulation
185.46s - 189.06s |  for OT and critical infrastructure environment.
189.06s - 191.70s |  So we know the process is going on a lot
191.70s - 197.70s |  to know how to process that or that on those environments.
197.70s - 200.34s |  And for people, according to our observation,
200.34s - 202.34s |  these very interesting things is we
202.34s - 205.86s |  know the security awareness and the training
205.86s - 208.10s |  of OT operators here.
208.10s - 209.74s |  We focus on OT operators.
209.74s - 212.10s |  It's very, very nerve.
212.10s - 213.26s |  Why we say that?
213.26s - 215.14s |  So here's the evidence here.
215.14s - 217.14s |  We know there are many OT security
217.14s - 220.22s |  incidents, including phishing email for the root cause,
220.22s - 224.06s |  including phishing email or some employee actions.
224.06s - 226.22s |  Sometimes, it will be malicious motivations,
226.22s - 228.30s |  or sometimes, it will be unintentional.
228.30s - 233.18s |  But here, you will see, between 2023 and 2024 here,
233.18s - 235.38s |  there is still something different.
235.38s - 239.14s |  For 2023, phishing email, employee actions,
239.14s - 244.78s |  they will be the root cause for the OT security incident.
244.82s - 247.94s |  And for the 2024 ransomware attack
247.94s - 251.42s |  and for the mobility patch, but we know the one key reason
251.42s - 256.58s |  is even in 2024, our answer from those CISOs
256.58s - 262.02s |  in the OT environment, the answer ransomware
262.02s - 266.94s |  is their first priority and the key root cause
266.94s - 269.26s |  for the OT security incident.
269.26s - 274.46s |  But there's still one thing is, the thing
274.46s - 278.54s |  is, the ransomware attack is not totally
278.54s - 280.86s |  performed by those attackers.
280.86s - 286.62s |  Sometimes, they also put some hold on the environment issue
286.62s - 288.18s |  in the OT industry.
288.18s - 291.14s |  So that's why those attackers can
291.14s - 295.18s |  leverage those vulnerabilities or those issues
295.18s - 298.38s |  to take over the entire OT environment.
298.38s - 306.14s |  So that's why we say those OT security winners and training
306.14s - 310.06s |  is not enough for this moment for those environments here.
310.06s - 312.98s |  And for the people, we also say human resource gap
312.98s - 314.98s |  for the OT security professionals.
314.98s - 316.42s |  Why we say that?
316.42s - 319.38s |  Why we say that the shortage for the cybersecurity professionals
319.38s - 322.22s |  here is we focus on many environments here
322.22s - 328.02s |  for the integration between IT and OT environment.
328.02s - 330.86s |  So we know one thing is, in the OT environment,
330.86s - 336.38s |  there are many industries, such as chemical or pharmaceuticals.
336.38s - 339.54s |  But the key point is, in a different industry,
339.54s - 344.38s |  they have different OT security professional requirements.
344.38s - 347.70s |  However, in this stage, in this moment,
347.70s - 350.62s |  those OT security professionals still
350.62s - 353.14s |  rely on IT security professionals.
353.14s - 355.62s |  So we will say they are not integrated.
355.62s - 357.46s |  They still rely on IT environment.
357.46s - 363.06s |  So the real thing is, those OT guys or those OT security staff,
363.06s - 366.46s |  they don't know, those IT people don't know how to perform
366.46s - 369.70s |  and how to run the real OT cybersecurity things.
369.70s - 375.18s |  So that's why we say they lack the OT and IT integration.
375.18s - 379.06s |  And also, sorry.
379.06s - 385.22s |  And also, the talent gap is difficult to hire.
385.22s - 386.78s |  So for OT security professionals,
386.78s - 389.86s |  for example, if you need to do the OT security
389.86s - 392.62s |  in a semiconductor, first things,
392.62s - 394.46s |  you need to know what kinds of things.
394.46s - 396.26s |  Semiconductor process.
396.26s - 399.70s |  What is the operation for semiconductor industry?
399.70s - 402.58s |  What is semiconductor security issue?
402.58s - 406.10s |  What is different things between semiconductor or IT environment
406.10s - 407.98s |  for the cybersecurity, for the threads?
407.98s - 409.18s |  So we need to know that.
409.18s - 411.66s |  And also, if we also judgement that,
411.66s - 415.06s |  and we are hard to hire those professionals
415.06s - 416.34s |  for the semiconductor.
416.34s - 419.70s |  So that's why security professional is not so enough here
419.70s - 423.78s |  and also hire high quality people here for the high recent.
423.78s - 427.94s |  And in 2024, we also know low security team,
427.94s - 430.02s |  they don't have enough capabilities
430.02s - 434.22s |  to deal with the lowest OT security things and incidents.
434.22s - 439.14s |  The things we encounter and we have from our survey is,
439.14s - 440.70s |  those things are usually well answered.
440.70s - 443.42s |  They need to seek for third party help
443.42s - 446.06s |  to handle OT security incidents.
446.78s - 449.50s |  All OT security incidents or IT security teams
449.50s - 453.10s |  are hard to deal with low security incidents
453.10s - 454.22s |  in their OT environment.
454.22s - 455.58s |  They need to seek help.
455.58s - 457.82s |  So there will be a security professional leak
457.82s - 460.62s |  or leakage here.
460.62s - 463.38s |  So that's why we need to try to engage
463.38s - 466.06s |  and make the IT and OT security team
466.06s - 468.46s |  to correlate with each others.
468.46s - 470.98s |  And we need to know how to increase
470.98s - 472.86s |  the high quality OT security professional.
472.86s - 474.58s |  We need to perform a kind of training.
474.58s - 476.74s |  We need to know the operation process.
476.74s - 478.34s |  Some people will say,
478.34s - 481.02s |  we don't need to know the difference in the conductor
481.02s - 482.94s |  or different industry process
482.94s - 484.50s |  that we can do the OT cybersecurity.
484.50s - 486.22s |  I will say totally wrong
486.22s - 488.78s |  because their operation is still different
488.78s - 491.46s |  in each environment for chemical, for pharmaceutical.
491.46s - 494.18s |  They are different operation, they are different machine.
494.18s - 497.62s |  They are different perimeter or issue here on that.
497.62s - 499.58s |  So it's very different.
499.58s - 501.78s |  And the four will be more tech vouchers,
501.78s - 503.54s |  target critical infrastructure
503.54s - 505.70s |  and OT and enterprise environment.
505.70s - 507.18s |  So why we say that?
507.18s - 509.78s |  I will say the most simplified things is,
509.78s - 514.78s |  OT have more large scope for attackers.
514.90s - 516.66s |  Between the IT and OT,
516.66s - 519.10s |  so we will say IT, we don't mention IT here,
519.10s - 520.38s |  but for the OT environment,
520.38s - 522.94s |  they have more and more devices on that.
522.94s - 525.26s |  They have more and more operation on that.
525.26s - 530.10s |  So they have thousands or hundreds of thousands devices,
530.14s - 532.50s |  operations, process, perimeters,
532.50s - 537.50s |  or everything on that more than IT for over 100 times.
537.62s - 542.18s |  So nowadays, the IT, OT are already convergency.
542.18s - 545.74s |  We say, usually we will have shared some proof laters,
545.74s - 548.42s |  but we know the IT, OT are already convergency.
548.42s - 551.78s |  So if I bring to those IT operation,
551.78s - 553.86s |  OT operation on the attack surface,
553.86s - 556.46s |  we will face those attack vector
556.46s - 559.26s |  more than IT environment here.
559.26s - 561.82s |  So for example, communication protocol.
562.78s - 566.34s |  OT environment still use legacy OT communication protocol,
566.34s - 571.10s |  such as Modbus, such as Mailsoft, Mailsec,
571.10s - 572.82s |  or different vendor protocol.
572.82s - 575.54s |  They usually are encrypted protocol.
575.54s - 577.22s |  They are very high risk.
577.22s - 580.94s |  And also, those PLCs, those servers,
580.94s - 583.78s |  they're never patched or even patched,
583.78s - 585.62s |  they have more and more applications.
585.62s - 586.90s |  So we will say,
586.90s - 590.90s |  those attack vector is higher than IT environment.
590.90s - 593.86s |  So that's why we say that those attack vector is higher.
593.86s - 598.86s |  And also, not only malware, not only insider threat,
598.90s - 601.42s |  in OT environment, depends on their features
604.54s - 606.94s |  in a different OT environment or industry.
606.94s - 608.90s |  Sometimes they will leverage GPS.
608.90s - 611.54s |  For example, some power plant will use GPS
611.54s - 612.98s |  to look at their time,
612.98s - 614.58s |  because time accuracy is very important
614.58s - 617.70s |  in the power plant and power industry or energy.
617.70s - 620.82s |  Or sometimes for semiconductor, for the manufacturing,
620.82s - 622.58s |  they are more take care of the third-party
622.58s - 624.62s |  and supply chain threats,
624.62s - 627.86s |  because they are already aware those attack
627.86s - 630.50s |  can successfully intrude their environment
630.50s - 633.18s |  basically from third-party from supply chain.
633.18s - 636.66s |  For semiconductor, it's very interesting thing is,
636.66s - 638.74s |  usually they buy devices.
638.74s - 642.18s |  These devices may be already
642.18s - 644.34s |  on $1 million, $2 million already.
645.30s - 646.98s |  Those devices are even expensive,
646.98s - 651.50s |  but they already be deployed in a virus inside the devices
651.50s - 655.58s |  before they provide to those semiconductor industry.
655.58s - 657.78s |  So before that, so the supply chain is also on that,
657.78s - 662.06s |  also will increase the attack vector on the environment.
662.06s - 664.50s |  And also 5G security and satellite.
666.82s - 669.26s |  In recently, TS1 also noticed
669.26s - 673.02s |  a very key interesting part is satellite.
673.06s - 675.66s |  And we also do a lot of research on satellite risk.
675.66s - 679.34s |  We know nowadays in a different industry,
679.34s - 683.66s |  they also deploy and they need to make long distance issues
683.66s - 685.50s |  to solve a long distance issue.
685.50s - 689.94s |  They need to use the satellite or 5G
689.94s - 692.98s |  to solve the connection problem, communication problem.
692.98s - 695.74s |  And, but however, I was, unfortunately,
695.74s - 699.18s |  those satellite devices usually are encrypted
699.18s - 703.14s |  or are not secure at all after our survey.
703.14s - 705.82s |  So we will say in a straight landscape
705.82s - 708.50s |  or straight attack surface part,
708.50s - 710.14s |  OT environment is more than
710.14s - 713.26s |  and larger than IT environment in this moment.
714.90s - 718.62s |  And five, I will say endless ransomware.
718.62s - 721.82s |  This term may not be targeted by OT environment,
721.82s - 725.02s |  but unfortunately, those OT environment,
725.02s - 726.62s |  they have IT environment.
726.62s - 729.10s |  And those IT environments,
729.10s - 732.02s |  if a server and or attack by ransomware,
732.02s - 735.74s |  usually will impact on OT industry.
735.74s - 738.46s |  And we will show the evidence later here.
738.46s - 741.50s |  So for a straight evaluation in 2023,
741.50s - 744.86s |  we noticed and we also raised the issue
744.86s - 748.66s |  is ransomware still is a major attack in 2023.
748.66s - 752.46s |  They are still a lot of attacks or security incidents
752.46s - 755.26s |  in OT environment or in OT industry
755.26s - 757.54s |  related with ransomware.
757.54s - 761.26s |  Because those ransomware will choose a valuable target.
762.14s - 764.02s |  Who have money, who has money,
764.02s - 765.98s |  who have most powerful money,
765.98s - 769.94s |  they will attack those industry or those company
769.94s - 772.50s |  because they can ransom that more easily.
772.50s - 773.98s |  And in fact, they are right.
773.98s - 776.34s |  For manufacturing, for the chemical,
776.34s - 779.26s |  for the car industry, automation industry,
779.26s - 781.26s |  automotive industry, they are right.
781.26s - 783.26s |  They will pay the ransom.
784.26s - 787.58s |  And for the third, I will say IT and OT
787.58s - 789.18s |  are highly contingency.
789.18s - 792.06s |  Unfortunately, this highly contingency
792.06s - 796.26s |  is very good and also bad.
796.26s - 797.18s |  Why good?
797.18s - 798.42s |  Because of the operator,
798.42s - 800.98s |  they are more easily to operate everything,
800.98s - 803.78s |  every process in OT and IT control system.
803.78s - 805.46s |  But what is the bad?
805.46s - 809.10s |  The bad is the most OT environment
809.10s - 812.14s |  is impacted by IT incidents.
812.34s - 815.62s |  So we can see the table here in 2023.
815.62s - 820.62s |  Yes, we have over 143 direct label or above.
822.82s - 827.82s |  The answer is they are strongly or suddenly affected by,
829.02s - 831.22s |  they have incident by IT environment,
831.22s - 835.42s |  but those incident also impact on OT environment.
835.42s - 839.34s |  And in 2024, the percentage is increasing a little bit
839.66s - 842.82s |  to 97% in total.
842.82s - 845.86s |  So the key point, the key thing is,
845.86s - 849.98s |  those attack, if impact IT environment,
849.98s - 854.42s |  almost will impact OT environment according our survey.
854.42s - 856.70s |  So that will be the bad part
858.58s - 859.98s |  for the OT environment nowadays,
859.98s - 862.14s |  for our automation here.
862.14s - 867.14s |  And also, we also survey and ask our people one question is,
868.14s - 872.66s |  OT security incident in the past 12 months,
872.66s - 877.66s |  and we also have 59% people answer say yes,
877.90s - 881.70s |  or not only, but not OT security incident,
881.70s - 884.14s |  but also they don't have,
884.14s - 886.78s |  but they also don't provide
886.78s - 890.18s |  or don't do any forensics or investigation on that,
890.18s - 892.30s |  even they get alert.
892.30s - 896.58s |  So main is visibility, I will say visibility.
897.10s - 900.78s |  People answer say yes, is they realize,
900.78s - 903.98s |  they also notice, they have system monitoring,
903.98s - 907.14s |  those incident happens, they can handle that.
907.14s - 911.94s |  But one part is, they may not have enough mechanism
911.94s - 916.54s |  to monitor, to find the attacker is ongoing,
916.54s - 919.02s |  or already be performed by those attacker.
919.02s - 920.58s |  They don't know how.
920.58s - 922.98s |  So they don't have forensics or investigation on that.
922.98s - 926.02s |  So that's why we conduct the answer together
926.82s - 931.34s |  to the 59% here, very interesting.
931.34s - 935.10s |  And also, this table was very interesting,
935.10s - 937.34s |  because it's already a little bit different
937.34s - 939.62s |  with our thinking here.
939.62s - 942.42s |  So here is where we are real time recovery
942.42s - 945.74s |  for the OT attack, remember the challenge here is,
945.74s - 949.02s |  you will see the major attackers,
949.02s - 951.18s |  such as APT attacks, DDoS attacks,
951.18s - 953.58s |  employee actions for human errors,
953.58s - 957.54s |  and for employee actions here, malicious intentions,
957.54s - 961.38s |  usually they need to use one day to one week
961.38s - 963.38s |  to recover their environment.
963.38s - 966.46s |  But if you see the virus,
966.46s - 968.62s |  if you see a third party vendor,
968.62s - 972.98s |  they need to take care for almost five minutes to one hours,
972.98s - 976.34s |  or to just real time.
976.34s - 978.74s |  It's a very interesting part, but we still carry out,
978.74s - 981.70s |  we still figure out why they answer this question.
981.70s - 983.26s |  And also, currently surveyed,
983.26s - 986.58s |  we still try to understand why those CISO
986.58s - 991.58s |  can show the real time recovery from here, this table.
991.66s - 997.39s |  We're still trying to know why for this.
997.39s - 998.91s |  And for some products,
998.91s - 1001.79s |  huge impact on critical infrastructure.
1001.79s - 1006.79s |  We always say, well, OT is very important.
1006.99s - 1009.99s |  They are very critical, there are many money,
1009.99s - 1014.67s |  but here is our survey to show the proof.
1014.67s - 1017.19s |  Say, according to those director,
1017.19s - 1021.51s |  label people from a different manufacturing industry,
1021.51s - 1024.67s |  in this question, in this survey,
1024.67s - 1027.39s |  they can answer the three questions,
1027.39s - 1029.27s |  they can choose the three answers
1029.27s - 1032.39s |  for the most concerning path of a security incident.
1032.39s - 1033.47s |  And they are worried about,
1033.47s - 1036.71s |  they also, some people on the survey,
1036.71s - 1038.67s |  they already encounter a lot of attacks.
1038.71s - 1042.31s |  They're also afraid for the compromise,
1042.31s - 1044.39s |  compromise the operational functions,
1044.39s - 1047.11s |  or productivity lost.
1047.11s - 1050.35s |  You will see, including Germany, including USA,
1050.35s - 1054.11s |  including basically in total, they are afraid on that.
1054.11s - 1057.75s |  They know those cybersecurity event will make a huge impact,
1057.75s - 1061.87s |  and some of them have happened before.
1061.87s - 1064.47s |  And also, they're also afraid for the key point,
1064.47s - 1068.51s |  since it's those operation control and safety issues
1069.35s - 1070.55s |  in Japan.
1070.55s - 1072.07s |  And Japan also very think about that.
1072.07s - 1073.23s |  So I will say different countries,
1073.23s - 1075.87s |  they have a little different situation.
1075.87s - 1077.75s |  Because of this survey, we deal with Germany,
1077.75s - 1081.11s |  we deal with USA, we deal with Japan, or UAE,
1081.11s - 1082.43s |  and including Taiwan.
1082.43s - 1084.11s |  But I not raise Taiwan's situation here,
1084.11s - 1087.67s |  because Taiwan's situation is very, very special here.
1087.67s - 1091.67s |  So you will see the 2024 reputation damage,
1091.67s - 1095.95s |  revenue losses, can be raised for the answer.
1095.95s - 1100.95s |  For those CISO, they are more take care for the reputation
1101.19s - 1104.95s |  and the revenue than 2023.
1104.95s - 1105.79s |  They are there in 2023.
1105.79s - 1107.43s |  This is a very interesting part.
1107.43s - 1111.35s |  But back to the worry, so the key point highlight us is,
1111.35s - 1114.39s |  they really worry about those security attack
1114.39s - 1117.71s |  and cybersecurity attack will impact their product,
1117.71s - 1121.11s |  their productivity, or their operation and realities.
1121.11s - 1122.71s |  They're just afraid of that.
1122.75s - 1124.91s |  And also, in the average,
1126.91s - 1131.91s |  they also try to draw or survey or planning on that.
1131.91s - 1134.03s |  So they want to evaluate,
1134.03s - 1136.95s |  if those cybersecurity attack happened,
1136.95s - 1140.75s |  how many lost in their OT environment?
1140.75s - 1141.59s |  How many?
1141.59s - 1143.27s |  So they also do a survey.
1143.27s - 1148.27s |  So on average, you will see 100K here to 15K here
1149.11s - 1154.11s |  will be the major part for the 21% in general.
1155.23s - 1157.19s |  They were afraid of that.
1157.19s - 1159.31s |  But according to our survey internally,
1159.31s - 1161.75s |  enough survey to those CISO people,
1161.75s - 1163.99s |  a little more high-end on that.
1163.99s - 1166.11s |  Because in a real war,
1166.11s - 1171.11s |  if the one operation loses or is dropped or shut down,
1174.91s - 1177.19s |  according to our survey or our real experience,
1177.19s - 1179.55s |  those birth factory usually will be lost
1179.55s - 1183.59s |  maybe 200 million or above
1183.59s - 1185.95s |  in a key industry in a major manufacturing.
1185.95s - 1187.91s |  But those people answers is,
1187.91s - 1192.91s |  they usually between the 100K to 15K here in 2024.
1194.03s - 1199.03s |  And also, in Japan, they are a little higher
1199.43s - 1200.99s |  than the other countries.
1200.99s - 1203.75s |  They usually target 300K here,
1203.75s - 1206.47s |  the level, they are just afraid they are lost.
1206.47s - 1209.55s |  But in Japan, our target mainly focus on the manufacturing
1209.55s - 1211.59s |  for general manufacturing here.
1212.51s - 1213.91s |  And also, for number A,
1213.91s - 1217.35s |  we'll be enterprise are aware in the cybersecurity of OT
1217.35s - 1221.23s |  and fast-training their strategy for perspective here.
1221.23s - 1222.35s |  So why we say that?
1223.59s - 1226.27s |  The more simplified things is budget.
1226.27s - 1230.95s |  So in 2023, 76% people answers say
1230.95s - 1232.99s |  they were increasing their budget.
1232.99s - 1236.71s |  In 2024, 68% here.
1236.71s - 1241.03s |  But Japan, they decrease their budget
1241.03s - 1243.27s |  for the OT cybersecurity.
1243.27s - 1246.83s |  And the people answer as a discussion for 102.
1246.83s - 1251.83s |  102 people in the, so mainly say 102 companies in Japan
1252.43s - 1257.31s |  answers they will decrease their cybersecurity budget
1257.31s - 1259.35s |  in the 2024 area.
1259.35s - 1261.47s |  So the importance will be different
1261.51s - 1263.63s |  from a different country perspective here.
1264.83s - 1265.67s |  And solution.
1267.71s - 1268.99s |  Solution is very interesting part
1268.99s - 1271.39s |  because they already deployed solution
1271.39s - 1272.91s |  cannot solve the problem practically.
1272.91s - 1273.99s |  Why we say that?
1273.99s - 1277.23s |  But interesting part is 93 companies
1277.23s - 1279.79s |  already deploy a cybersecurity solution
1279.79s - 1282.51s |  in their OT environment, according to our answer,
1282.51s - 1284.07s |  according to the answer we get.
1284.07s - 1288.03s |  And also, they also deploy for network solution
1288.03s - 1290.67s |  or endpoint solution in a major part.
1290.71s - 1293.83s |  But however, and also they need to run POC
1293.83s - 1296.19s |  or they need to improve their product
1296.19s - 1297.31s |  with choose the product
1298.75s - 1302.99s |  from three to six months on average.
1302.99s - 1304.59s |  But why we say that?
1304.59s - 1305.83s |  It's still not good.
1305.83s - 1306.67s |  Why?
1306.67s - 1308.67s |  Because they usually deploy,
1308.67s - 1312.27s |  they usually use IT cybersecurity solution
1312.27s - 1316.39s |  in their environment, not OT specific.
1316.39s - 1317.63s |  This will be different.
1317.63s - 1321.91s |  For example, for example, if IT solution,
1321.91s - 1324.39s |  they usually use the heavy memory usage
1325.47s - 1330.27s |  or they don't care BSOD situation in their product.
1330.27s - 1332.35s |  But in OT specific environment,
1332.35s - 1335.75s |  they usually put operation as a first priority.
1335.75s - 1337.55s |  This will be key difference
1337.55s - 1340.63s |  between IT and OT cybersecurity issue.
1340.63s - 1342.43s |  And also the manpower is still not enough
1342.43s - 1346.63s |  for an OT environment for a 26 staff,
1346.67s - 1349.07s |  only a 26% staff,
1349.07s - 1353.55s |  only one staff for over 200 devices.
1353.55s - 1354.63s |  They need to take care.
1354.63s - 1356.47s |  It's a very heavy things.
1356.47s - 1359.67s |  And also it's a lot for the number nine here
1359.67s - 1361.99s |  is the unprotected Windows devices
1361.99s - 1363.99s |  in OT environment are common.
1363.99s - 1364.83s |  Why?
1364.83s - 1368.11s |  Why we have number 10?
1368.11s - 1370.27s |  In the number nine, we say they deploy,
1370.27s - 1374.59s |  we already have 93% company or answers,
1374.59s - 1376.31s |  they deploy their cybersecurity solution
1376.31s - 1377.67s |  in OT environment,
1377.67s - 1382.59s |  but the deploy coverage is not 100%,
1382.59s - 1384.23s |  are not 100%.
1384.23s - 1386.83s |  So you will see only 61%,
1386.83s - 1389.11s |  so here is 61% organization
1389.11s - 1393.43s |  still have unprotected Windows devices
1393.43s - 1394.51s |  in their environment,
1394.51s - 1397.79s |  no matter when endpoint solution or network solution.
1397.79s - 1401.63s |  In 2024, 77% because Windows 7 also including,
1401.63s - 1406.19s |  Windows 10 also including in the legacy Windows devices.
1406.19s - 1408.95s |  So here is the interesting part is,
1408.95s - 1409.79s |  even like I said,
1409.79s - 1411.55s |  they already deploy cybersecurity solution
1411.55s - 1413.11s |  in their OT environment,
1413.11s - 1415.99s |  but the answer is they are not 100% deploy
1415.99s - 1417.59s |  in their OT environment.
1417.59s - 1421.27s |  So their protection is still not enough,
1421.27s - 1424.91s |  according to our survey for the answer here.
1424.91s - 1427.19s |  So I know there's a very quick part is,
1428.63s - 1431.43s |  we will say the organizations in a different industry,
1432.23s - 1436.15s |  they need to prioritize their OT proactive defense strategy.
1436.15s - 1438.35s |  We need to take care many, too many things
1438.35s - 1439.83s |  in their environment,
1439.83s - 1442.11s |  including supply chain, asset expansion,
1442.11s - 1444.63s |  straight intelligence, no experimentation,
1444.63s - 1445.47s |  they need to take care
1445.47s - 1448.43s |  because they encountered too many attack surface
1448.43s - 1450.27s |  on their OT environment,
1450.27s - 1454.11s |  but they need to evaluate what kinds of risks
1454.11s - 1457.31s |  is their first priority here in their OT environment,
1457.31s - 1459.55s |  and they need to take care on that.
1459.55s - 1461.99s |  So this will be the 24 part
1461.99s - 1464.75s |  where we should be take care for the environment here.
1464.75s - 1467.59s |  So I think it will be all over on my presentation.
1467.59s - 1468.75s |  And if you have any question,
1468.75s - 1469.99s |  you can go to the stage,
1469.99s - 1470.83s |  I will answer you.
1470.83s - 1471.67s |  Thank you.
