 All right, sorry for the delays
3.10s - 7.14s |  So this is safe cracking for everyone. My name is Jared
13.63s - 15.95s |  Okay, so a little bit about me. I
17.07s - 20.23s |  Am a lock sport enthusiast. I have been picking locks
20.75s - 26.87s |  For close to 20 years now and I got into safe manipulation shortly after
26.87s - 29.63s |  I've been doing that for about 15 years. I
30.59s - 32.59s |  game a bunch
32.59s - 37.99s |  And I'm a professional rock climber. That's like my main source of income at the moment
38.39s - 43.63s |  so this talk this talk will cover how
44.49s - 47.73s |  specifically group two mechanical safe locks work
47.85s - 54.97s |  so there's different classifications, which I will go over and group two is sort of just the standard sort of
55.37s - 57.45s |  security classification for safe locks
58.81s - 62.57s |  Whatever safe you buy essentially if it has a mechanical lock on it
63.09s - 66.69s |  Vast majority of the time it will be a group two safe lock
66.69s - 72.45s |  I will cover the flaws in this design and how we can exploit them as well as
72.73s - 74.93s |  variations on the techniques that we use
76.69s - 80.41s |  And then I will also cover differences between group two safe locks
80.85s - 86.49s |  They all operate on the same principles, but there are some slight differences that set them apart from each other
87.09s - 94.90s |  so the security classification starts with group two as the lowest security classification and
95.22s - 100.06s |  There is absolutely nothing preventing anyone from figuring out the combination
100.90s - 108.66s |  and then group 2m there are some small improvements to where they make it a lot harder to manipulate and
109.22s - 116.26s |  then group one is the high security classification where they add in a lot of extra features and
117.70s - 122.14s |  Supposedly they're supposed to withstand manipulation for about 20 hours minimum
123.02s - 125.02s |  However, that is completely
125.74s - 127.74s |  false and I
127.98s - 133.14s |  Don't actually understand why they have different groups because they all kind of suck at the moment
133.38s - 138.62s |  and then group 1r is the same as group 1, but the R stands for
140.18s - 144.58s |  Radiologically resistant so a common attack could be
145.14s - 148.34s |  using x-rays to view the inside of the lock and
148.54s - 155.82s |  So they make the parts inside out of plastic usually Delrin a low-density plastic and it makes it really hard to x-ray it
156.26s - 160.40s |  So I will cover the parts of a lock here
163.32s - 165.32s |  normally, I would go up to the screen and
166.40s - 169.04s |  Point, but however, I don't think that's possible
170.08s - 172.24s |  So you should see a large
172.92s - 180.08s |  Brass circle in the center and it's got a bit of a cutout on it. That is called the drive cam
187.09s - 189.09s |  All
207.64s - 210.52s |  Right, cool. So here this is the drive cam
210.88s - 217.48s |  This is connected directly with a dial. So as you turn the dial this drive cam will turn as well
218.56s - 222.76s |  We have this arm. This arm is we just call it the the lever
223.64s - 230.08s |  But this protrusion is called the nose and that nose as you can see rests on top of the drive cam
231.16s - 233.16s |  Behind the drive cam we have wheels
235.08s - 249.45s |  All right, so when you dial the combination on one of these locks what happens is these wheels
249.61s - 255.89s |  They have a cutout called a gate in them. Okay, there's one gate per wheel and dialing the correct combination
256.77s - 259.21s |  Lines up each of these gates with each other
259.81s - 264.85s |  Now behind the lever you can see a bar. That bar is a fence. That's what we call it
264.85s - 270.45s |  And when you dial the correct combination all of the gates will be lined up under the fence
270.45s - 273.93s |  And that is so that the fence can fall into the gates
274.61s - 281.91s |  so here we can see the correct combination has been dialed and
283.99s - 291.63s |  When you turn the drive cam so that this cutout is underneath the nose that allows everything to fall down and what that does is
291.91s - 297.43s |  Turning the dial further here pulls on the nose and allows the bolt to be retracted
297.83s - 310.22s |  If I can get this camera to show at least somewhat I can show a little
310.62s - 312.02s |  example here
312.02s - 319.35s |  so we are looking at the top of the lock and you can see and
320.59s - 324.43s |  You can see there is a bar and that is the fence
325.63s - 327.63s |  Behind it underneath it are the wheels
328.75s - 330.75s |  When you dial the combination
331.43s - 333.15s |  Here we go
333.15s - 335.91s |  Okay, it will line up each of the gates
336.99s - 338.11s |  underneath
338.11s - 344.17s |  that fence
344.17s - 346.69s |  Sorry, it's a little hard to keep this in view
352.16s - 354.16s |  Okay, so I
354.32s - 357.16s |  Am lining up the gates underneath the fence
372.66s - 387.50s |  Sorry for the technical difficulties here. Not sure how visible that is
388.50s - 393.36s |  All right. Well, we'll just go back to the slides
394.20s - 407.18s |  So essentially the way that it works is each of the wheels
407.86s - 409.50s |  to in turn
409.50s - 415.06s |  Grab the wheels behind it. So that drive cam which is directly connected to the dial
416.58s - 420.18s |  Has a protrusion much like this wheel does here and
420.86s - 426.50s |  That protrusion will ride in a groove on top of the wheel behind it
427.26s - 434.94s |  until it hits the the protrusion on that wheel and so essentially it can freely ride around and
435.42s - 440.14s |  Once it makes contact it will grab that wheel and it will turn with the dial
440.90s - 444.58s |  That wheel on the bottom also has a protrusion
444.58s - 452.18s |  This is called a drive pin that drive pin will ride in a groove on the wheel behind it until it hits
452.94s - 457.82s |  That wheel and picks it up. So it takes one rotation
458.62s - 461.82s |  To ensure that you have picked up the next wheel
461.98s - 468.34s |  That's because if you are moving the wheel in one direction and you reverse rotation
468.34s - 472.70s |  You have to go all the way around until they can pick it up again
475.43s - 477.43s |  Here's an example
477.43s - 478.47s |  I
478.47s - 480.47s |  Put this here in case the camera didn't work
480.79s - 485.87s |  I would like to show this more visually, but this is the best I have at the moment
485.99s - 492.39s |  So we can imagine this black piece at the back being the drive cam and each of these wheels being one of the wheels in
492.39s - 500.83s |  The lock so what happens is this this drive cam will spin around and here it's making contact with the drive pin of this
500.91s - 507.35s |  Third wheel the wheel closest to the drive cam is called the third wheel then the second and then the first and
507.67s - 511.67s |  So if we wanted to spin this wheel and the other direction
512.23s - 518.55s |  this drive cam would turn all the way around one full rotation until it can hit this drive pin and
519.43s - 524.39s |  Same thing for this third wheel if we want the third wheel to pick up the second wheel
524.39s - 529.47s |  It has to go all the way around until it hits the drive pin and so on and so forth
529.47s - 536.19s |  And so this is how all the wheels are able to move together, but also be able to be set separately
536.83s - 541.78s |  so vulnerabilities
542.38s - 545.22s |  So here we have a close-up of the drive cam
545.78s - 550.14s |  Now the nose normally rests on top of the drive drive cam
550.14s - 555.66s |  It will rest and ride along the whole outer edge of the drive cam as the drive cam spins
556.66s - 563.54s |  But when we get to this drop-in area the nose will drop in ever so slightly and
564.94s - 570.38s |  The vulnerability here is this is not symmetrical this drop-in point is
571.38s - 575.46s |  Asymmetrical and on one side we have a great curve to it
575.46s - 580.98s |  And so you can see the further down we go in this drop-in point
581.22s - 586.94s |  There is less wiggle room from one side to the other is significantly less than up high
586.94s - 589.58s |  There's much more wiggle room up there
589.58s - 596.06s |  And the thing about this is because that nose will go a little bit into the drop-in point
596.62s - 603.12s |  When we turn the drive cam we can feel it hit the wall of that drop-in area
604.30s - 607.98s |  We can actually feel that on the dial as a bit of resistance
608.26s - 615.30s |  So we spin the dial so that this drop-in point is centered below the nose that nose is not touching the drive cam at all
615.30s - 619.78s |  and if we turn a little further than the nose will hit the edge as
620.22s - 627.06s |  In this picture right here, and we can feel when that happens, so if that nose is up high in
627.62s - 629.62s |  this contact or this
629.66s - 630.78s |  drop-in area
630.78s - 637.94s |  Then there will be a significant distance between the two points of contact on the walls of that drop-in area
637.94s - 639.94s |  And if the nose is lower
640.62s - 642.46s |  There will be less
642.46s - 644.46s |  distance between feeling those points of contact
646.91s - 653.55s |  Now the thing that determines how high or low that nose is in that area is the fence
653.77s - 657.61s |  The fence here you can see is resting above the wheels
657.73s - 660.93s |  So we have the nose that is on the drive cam right now
660.93s - 667.89s |  And that is what's keeping that fence up, but when we turn the dial so the nose is over that drop-in area
668.85s - 672.09s |  Then the fence will fall down and rest on the wheel pack
672.29s - 678.53s |  That is essentially testing for if the combination is correct or not if the gates were all aligned
678.61s - 684.87s |  Then the fence would not rest on top of the wheel pack it would simply fall in and that would allow the lock to open
685.71s - 692.83s |  So here you can see the wheels are all different sizes, that's because we are not able to manufacture
693.63s - 698.21s |  Multiple wheels to be exactly the same size or to be perfectly circular
698.71s - 704.19s |  So here we will always have one wheel that's larger than the others as you can see here
704.19s - 711.67s |  It is the first wheel all the way to the left furthest from the drive cam. There's space here on the second and third wheel
712.31s - 718.23s |  So if we were to turn the dial so that the nose is over that drop-in point this fence
718.67s - 725.39s |  Will hit and rest only on this first wheel because it sticks up above the rest
726.39s - 731.75s |  Now this is where the previous slide comes in handy with the narrower
732.15s - 736.67s |  Space the further down you go because if we were to feel
737.23s - 742.39s |  Those contact points that point at which the nose hits the wall of the drop-in area
742.79s - 747.75s |  Those are hard contact points and we measure how far apart those are
748.59s - 753.63s |  We would get a certain number a certain reading. Let's say on the dial that is six increments
754.47s - 758.91s |  But if we were to turn this first wheel and only this first wheel
759.19s - 765.11s |  So that the gate is underneath the fence this fence will not be resting up as high anymore
765.11s - 767.91s |  It will drop on to the next largest wheel
768.55s - 772.11s |  Causing the nose to be further down in that contact area
773.03s - 780.23s |  Which means that our points of contact are now going to be closer together instead of having a range of six
780.59s - 784.79s |  Sorry six numbers on the dial apart. Maybe we can feel those points of resistance
785.75s - 792.91s |  Five and a half numbers apart and that tells us that we have the largest wheel in the correct position
793.35s - 796.83s |  So if we had let's say dialed a test combination and
797.27s - 802.11s |  This is what we have and we measure the contact points to be six numbers apart
802.11s - 805.99s |  And then we dial the same exact test combination again
806.43s - 812.39s |  but with a different number for the first number in the combination which corresponds to the first wheel and that
812.71s - 817.71s |  Places the gate underneath the fence and we see that decrease in the contact area
818.23s - 823.39s |  Then we know whatever we just changed for that first number is the correct number
824.75s - 830.59s |  So you can see here it is resting on top of the first wheel and first wheel only this fence is not
830.75s - 832.63s |  Touching the second or third wheel
832.63s - 836.91s |  So if that first wheel does rotate so that the gate is underneath it
836.91s - 841.93s |  the fence will drop lower and we can feel that difference in the dial with how the
842.39s - 845.63s |  Nose touches the sides of that contact area
846.15s - 854.00s |  So essentially we have our plan of attack what we can do is we can find what's called a common low point and
856.20s - 862.48s |  That's because the wheels are not necessarily larger or smaller than the other wheels they can be
863.28s - 868.52s |  Bumpy or irregularly shaped. So if we have the wheels in the correct position
869.20s - 871.80s |  Maybe there is a bump on another wheel
872.36s - 875.18s |  Preventing that fence from falling down completely
875.36s - 882.20s |  So we want to find a point where across every wheel is a common low point where there are no extra
882.48s - 889.68s |  bumps or ridges on any of the wheels and we have that nose as far down in that contact area as we can and
890.76s - 895.12s |  We do something called wheel isolation. We will isolate the third wheel
895.36s - 901.14s |  So essentially if we are only moving one wheel at a time and we get a reading
901.38s - 906.90s |  That the nose is lower in that contact area so we can feel that point of resistance
907.70s - 912.26s |  where we feel the nose hitting the sides of that of that drive cam and
913.46s - 917.58s |  We feel that decrease and only one wheel is moving
917.78s - 922.52s |  We know exactly what number and what wheel is in the combination
922.52s - 927.42s |  So if we're only moving the third wheel and we move it from 10 to 12
927.42s - 934.06s |  And we have a drop in that in that reading that means 12 is a third number in the combination and makes things
934.62s - 936.62s |  really simple and
936.90s - 941.34s |  Then we have to look for gate signatures, which is that drop that I have been talking about
941.86s - 946.70s |  Feeling the drop in the range of the of the two contact points
947.74s - 950.90s |  Once we find that we can find the center of the gate
950.90s - 957.18s |  We want to be precise because there there is a range at which the lock will open
957.42s - 962.42s |  That is not the correct combination. If you set your combination to be 10 20 and 30
962.94s - 965.46s |  Then you can open it with 9
966.38s - 967.38s |  21
967.38s - 974.46s |  29 that is a valid combination. Most locks will open plus or minus one and a quarter numbers on either side
975.42s - 979.90s |  So we want to find the center as close to the true combination as we can
980.14s - 984.90s |  In case we made a mistake along the way and we can repeat these steps for the second wheel
985.10s - 989.26s |  So essentially we can move only the second wheel in the lock by itself
989.26s - 994.54s |  And so if we find a gate signature if we find a decrease in that contact area
994.98s - 1001.18s |  Then we know what our second number in the combination is and there is no need to do this for the first wheel
1001.18s - 1006.26s |  And that's because if you have two numbers in a combination that has three numbers
1006.90s - 1011.22s |  you just brute force the last one you just dial every two increments and
1011.62s - 1016.22s |  Then you don't have to worry about trying to manipulate the lock and get a reading
1017.38s - 1024.98s |  Now there's a reason we go from three to one and that's because the wheel that is closest to the drive cam is
1024.98s - 1026.66s |  wheel three and
1026.66s - 1031.10s |  That lever is spring-loaded. It has a spring pressing down on it
1031.66s - 1037.94s |  That spring is only on one half. So it causes it to tilt. So when you are
1038.86s - 1045.06s |  So when you are turning the dial so the nose is over that that drop-in point
1045.90s - 1053.10s |  The fence will hit the wheels and it will actually tilt and cause it to only make contact with wheel three
1053.10s - 1060.42s |  I want to say 90% of the time and I say 90% because it's not always the same due to tolerances
1060.62s - 1067.06s |  But that is also why we find the common low point. That is why we find an area across all the wheels
1067.94s - 1071.62s |  That don't interfere with each other that there are no bumps is that it will help us
1071.86s - 1076.18s |  Ensure that wheel three will be the first wheel that the fence touches
1076.70s - 1082.64s |  so the way we find this common low point is we can spin every wheel together and
1083.60s - 1085.20s |  We can take
1085.20s - 1092.38s |  Contact point readings, which means you go to the place at which you can feel that resistance which you can feel that nose
1092.84s - 1096.40s |  hitting the side of that drive drive cam in that in that
1097.36s - 1105.16s |  Contact area when you feel that resistance whatever number that is on the dial that is your contact point reading
1107.36s - 1108.64s |  after that
1108.64s - 1114.04s |  So so we pick up all the wheels and we take contact point readings every ten increments
1114.04s - 1118.96s |  What that means is we will move every wheel together and on the dial
1118.96s - 1125.08s |  We will stop at zero then we will turn to that contact area and get our contact point
1125.12s - 1131.92s |  We will then turn all the wheels to ten and then twenty and then thirty so every ten increments
1132.04s - 1139.68s |  We take a contact point reading and we find the lowest reading we find the reading at which the wheels
1140.88s - 1145.68s |  Read the lowest so that is when the nose will be furthest down in that drive cam
1146.80s - 1154.02s |  We can leave the first and second wheels there so we can turn the dial until only the first two wheels are moving
1155.40s - 1158.64s |  and leave them there actually the third one moves too, but
1159.40s - 1166.44s |  we can it this gets the first and second wheels out of the way and we can then proceed to move the third wheel as
1166.56s - 1171.84s |  We see fit that third wheel is closest to the drive cam. So it is the first to move
1171.96s - 1174.68s |  So if we have our first and second wheels
1175.44s - 1179.52s |  Somewhere we can move the third wheel without interrupting them
1179.92s - 1183.40s |  So with the third wheel
1183.40s - 1189.84s |  we can then spin and pick up the third wheel after we drop the first two off where they need to be and
1190.36s - 1196.16s |  We can move it every two increments so we can take that third wheel and let's say we can start on zero
1196.44s - 1203.32s |  okay, and then we take a contact point reading so we just turn to that drop-in point and feel for the bit of resistance and
1203.32s - 1208.12s |  See what numbers on the dial and then we can go back to where we left the third wheel from zero
1208.12s - 1210.12s |  We can then turn to two
1210.20s - 1215.52s |  Go take a contact point reading and then go turn our wheel to four take a contact point reading
1215.52s - 1218.28s |  so we do this 50 times around the dial and
1219.04s - 1224.70s |  Because we're only moving one wheel whenever we see a drop in our contact point reading
1225.44s - 1232.34s |  We know that number we just turned the third wheel to is our third number in the combination. There is no ambiguity about it
1233.34s - 1239.98s |  From there we can actually go back and just move the wheel through that area again
1239.98s - 1246.20s |  So if we find a drop in that contact point when the third wheel is at 30 or let's say 32
1246.58s - 1249.50s |  We can go back and because we went every two increments
1249.50s - 1255.58s |  we can hit all the odd numbers and we can find the exact center of where it needs to be if
1256.66s - 1258.62s |  We do not have a gate indication
1258.62s - 1265.30s |  that's actually fine with this method because we can use the lowest point and pretend that is our actual number and
1265.46s - 1272.20s |  Simply repeating these steps with the lowest points will actually give us the real the real number in the combinations
1272.76s - 1276.43s |  The second wheel is a little more
1276.89s - 1283.13s |  Difficult. Um, I am kind of skimming through this because my camera is not working. Unfortunately. I can't show this visually
1283.97s - 1290.77s |  But the second wheel is just you you turn different number of times, but we're doing the same process
1291.13s - 1296.69s |  We are finding a way to move only the second wheel by itself inside the lock
1296.85s - 1299.97s |  So when we get an indication from the dial
1300.85s - 1310.46s |  We know it is the second number in the combination and for the first wheel if we had two good
1311.30s - 1312.26s |  Indications
1312.26s - 1314.50s |  Then we can brute force the first wheel
1315.10s - 1319.86s |  Dialing zero then the second number and third number and then to second number third number
1319.86s - 1321.98s |  We're just dialing full combinations
1321.98s - 1327.86s |  And what that does is allow us to cut down on the amount of time we need we spend dialing
1327.94s - 1331.42s |  Since going by every two numbers will open the lock
1333.06s - 1340.22s |  We can also keep track of the lowest point still just in case we were wrong earlier if we just keep
1340.46s - 1346.50s |  Intending that the lowest contact point readings we get is the real number in the combination
1346.50s - 1349.22s |  we can keep on repeating this process and
1350.18s - 1360.22s |  Eventually those low points will become the real numbers. So there are different types of group two locks
1361.68s - 1363.68s |  One second. Oh
1369.65s - 1371.85s |  Sorry, just trying to make sure I don't go over time here
1373.33s - 1375.41s |  So there are different types of group two locks
1375.77s - 1378.49s |  Legar 3330 is a very common one
1378.49s - 1384.73s |  It is not one I suggest starting out with the wheels are more oval. And what that means is
1385.45s - 1391.57s |  We want our gates to be of each wheel under the fence and the lock. That is what tells us
1391.57s - 1395.01s |  What is the right number or not with over wheels?
1395.53s - 1397.53s |  One wheel may shadow
1398.01s - 1402.57s |  Another wheel meaning when we have a gate underneath the fence
1402.57s - 1408.01s |  Another wheel could have a large bump on it because it's oval and might be
1408.57s - 1411.05s |  Keeping the fence from falling into that gate
1412.81s - 1415.21s |  We also have die bolt it's a very common
1416.33s - 1424.73s |  Lock for ATMs banks their drive cam is u-shaped. It is more symmetrical than what you have seen and
1425.29s - 1428.01s |  So in that case we can actually take
1428.05s - 1434.29s |  And so in that case we can actually take both contact points very carefully and
1434.89s - 1436.89s |  That will give us
1436.93s - 1438.93s |  the same results
1439.37s - 1444.01s |  Here it's a little off-screen, but this is the most common model that you will see
1444.85s - 1446.69s |  sergeant in Greenleaf
1446.69s - 1449.69s |  6730 or 6741 they are virtually identical
1450.45s - 1456.61s |  One can just be opened with one and a half numbers on either side. So a little easier to open
1457.21s - 1461.43s |  But then essentially they're the same and this is what I suggest everyone to start with
1462.61s - 1467.97s |  After this talk, I will have a table with a bunch of these set up in the lock picking village
1468.81s - 1470.81s |  And you can try hands-on
1471.53s - 1475.72s |  so
1475.72s - 1482.88s |  These are really important tips. Okay. These are not just tips if you don't succeed. These are things you have to go in
1483.56s - 1489.36s |  Knowing and the most important is being precise in everything not just dialing
1489.68s - 1496.44s |  But reading the dial from the same angle every time if you look at it from the side that will change what you see on
1496.44s - 1498.44s |  the dial
1498.56s - 1502.76s |  You want to read the contact point with the same amount of force so we can feel
1503.24s - 1506.32s |  When that nose hits the drive cam and that's our contact point
1506.80s - 1514.04s |  However, we have to feel that with the same amount of force every time or we will get a different number on the dial
1515.16s - 1517.96s |  we can also try with a known combination and
1518.80s - 1520.80s |  What that means is
1521.12s - 1524.48s |  Knowing the combination. So if I know the combination is 10 20 30
1524.48s - 1533.16s |  I can only test from 0 to 40 for instance, and I know I should have an indication in that area
1533.16s - 1535.16s |  So I do not have to waste my time
1535.36s - 1539.48s |  With numbers that I know are not in the combination. And so that helps
1540.20s - 1544.24s |  Helps with getting a feel for what you are looking for
1545.24s - 1550.56s |  You can also remove the back cover and look at inside the lock while you do it
1550.56s - 1553.52s |  And I have removed all the back covers on the locks
1553.64s - 1558.96s |  That will be for demonstration in the lock picking village so you can look inside and see what's happening. I
1559.80s - 1562.32s |  Apologize. I had some technical difficulties
1562.52s - 1567.32s |  So I understand that things are a little little complex with how I'm describing it
1567.32s - 1571.40s |  But we do have in-person demonstrations at the lock picking village
1572.36s - 1574.56s |  And if all else fails I do have a book
1575.96s - 1580.80s |  So the book is safe cracking for everyone on Amazon, but you don't need to buy it
1580.80s - 1584.12s |  That is only if you want the hardcopy version
1584.40s - 1591.00s |  There is a free PDF if you search the title of the book on YouTube safe cracking for everyone
1591.48s - 1593.96s |  There is it's like nine parts
1593.96s - 1600.72s |  But the first video in that series part one will have a link to the PDF of the book for free
1601.68s - 1605.68s |  other great resources are also the lock picking subreddit and
1606.92s - 1612.16s |  LPU lock pickers United discord. There should be a link to that discord in the subreddit
1612.48s - 1616.44s |  There's also a game called Sophie safe cracking simulator
1616.44s - 1618.32s |  I I don't know who Sophie is
1618.32s - 1623.48s |  But this is the best safe cracking game as that's all it is
1623.48s - 1627.56s |  it is just a lock and you can turn the dial and
1628.08s - 1635.08s |  There's different tools in this game where you can have x-ray vision, you know, you can practice with all these different
1636.08s - 1639.40s |  Variables that you can set up that you can't do in real life
1640.08s - 1643.76s |  and of course the best resource is practice, um, I
1644.80s - 1646.80s |  teach at a locksmithing
1647.48s - 1653.92s |  University and I have my safe manipulation course is about 18 hours long
1654.92s - 1659.24s |  That is not enough time for someone to be proficient with
1659.68s - 1663.72s |  guidance someone can open their first lock in that time, but I
1664.12s - 1668.60s |  Mean, I recommend at least 50 hours before you are even
1669.36s - 1675.80s |  Proficient in in this field. The hardest part is learning once you know and understand how a lock works
1676.48s - 1682.00s |  Then it's easy. It's just understanding that and getting the information that takes time
1684.32s - 1686.80s |  Here is the direct link to the book
1687.36s - 1689.36s |  I just hosted on Google Drive
1689.84s - 1693.76s |  Hopefully this QR code shows up well enough, but this should take you directly
1694.48s - 1697.60s |  To the PDF and you can download it and read it. I
1698.48s - 1703.48s |  Do include information on high security safe manipulation
1703.68s - 1709.00s |  This book as far as I know is the only place of that information
1709.00s - 1714.12s |  You cannot find that anywhere else and by high security safe manipulation
1714.12s - 1717.48s |  I mean there are locks in the group one category
1718.04s - 1722.44s |  that have been around this these designs have been around for a while and
1723.08s - 1726.24s |  Their methods of opening them are not new
1727.60s - 1731.32s |  And they are very insecure and they are not publicly available
1731.80s - 1738.00s |  so I decided to make that publicly available and this is the only place that I know of at which you can get that information and
1742.22s - 1746.34s |  That is that is it. Thank you for coming. Um, I
1747.02s - 1751.66s |  Really apologize for the technical difficulties and the convoluted explanations
1751.98s - 1759.54s |  But we will have in-person demonstrations. You can try yourself at the lock-picking village immediately after this. Thank you
