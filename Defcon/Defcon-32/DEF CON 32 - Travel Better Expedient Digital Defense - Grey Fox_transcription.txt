  "title": "DEF CON 32 - Travel Better  Expedient Digital Defense - Grey Fox",
  "description": "Expedient Digital Defense focuses on using free and readily available applications, or recommending paid-for commercial apps and tools that have proven records of credibility, to make our devices and online presence less harmful to us. We will follow a typical traveler in the United States, with some experiences drawn from overseas travel.\n\nThe talk stresses the value of Operational Security (OPSEC), and the mindset of seeing every piece of communication through the eyes of your adversary. The intent is to make people think twice before revealing anything considered sensitive, even if using the latest and greatest encryption. The surveillance economy and ever-present data collection in our modern world demand better awareness of how our digital world works. We\u2019ll discuss examples like invasive social media collection, foreign influence on public perception, data insecurity putting users in danger, and advertising models based on location and click tracking.\n\nFinally, the take-away is knowing the tools and tech available, and being able to select those which fit your needs, if at all. Most of the time, one mitigation isn't enough, and several need to be emplaced to achieve proper defense in depth, in case one solution fails. Even if no technical solutions are put in place, the user will have that \"red team\" mindset and awareness that calibrates better judgment over technical solutions, and promotes OPSEC and rational thinking for security rather than blindly depending on apps and gadgets.",

0.00s - 5.20s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 All right, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for bearing with us. New venue new everything. So,
5.84s - 10.56s |  you know, just a bunch of delayed delays, false starts, things like that. But hey,
10.56s - 16.00s |  I appreciate you coming out over here. So this is called as you can see on just the one screen,
16.00s - 25.04s |  travel better expedient digital defense. So I am Gray Fox. My background is retired Air Force.
25.04s - 29.04s |  I did basically intelligence for 20 years. A lot of that intelligence though,
29.60s - 34.56s |  involved some kind of either defensive or offensive cyber. It also involved briefing
34.56s - 38.64s |  a lot of people on how they can operate in environments where foreign intelligence
38.64s - 46.64s |  services were after them. So I created this briefing for them. It is it is typically long,
46.64s - 52.24s |  but we only have about a half hour with me. So we'll do our best over here. I do a bunch of
52.24s - 56.96s |  digital forensics on the side. I do product security and pen testing. Not so much on the
56.96s - 63.76s |  side. I really am into wireless stuff. My my big obsessions right now are setting up Wi-Fi
63.76s - 68.64s |  networks and then trying to break them. Wi-Fi is getting better. So I'm probably getting worse.
68.64s - 73.84s |  So I got to keep up with the times on that one. For my hobbies, I rock march. I put on heavy
73.84s - 79.20s |  weight and I walk around because, hey, who needs joints? Right. You know, but I don't do it on
79.20s - 83.44s |  sand. I'm sick of sand. I don't want to see sand ever again. Welcome to Las Vegas. Right.
84.96s - 87.44s |  So just to give you an idea of what we're getting into.
89.12s - 93.52s |  Just foundations. If you were coming in here expecting something very comprehensive,
93.52s - 98.08s |  I unfortunately can't give that. But what I'm hoping to leave you with is just a flavor
98.08s - 103.68s |  of what you can do to get a little bit deeper into things like wireless anti-tracking,
103.68s - 108.40s |  trying to reduce your attack surface when you're traveling and some things that you can do to
108.40s - 114.80s |  mitigate whatever dangers that or exploitation that could be posed to you if you happen to lose
114.80s - 120.00s |  your device or it gets stolen or you get pulled in by security and they take your devices and they
120.00s - 125.60s |  try to get information about you off of them. These things happen. Ask me how I know. I'm going
125.60s - 129.28s |  to give you some of those tips and some of those tools. What we're really looking for, though,
129.28s - 134.48s |  is a mindset. I'm not trying to sell you anything. It's just about how to think a little bit more like
134.48s - 138.88s |  the adversary when you're out and about, when you're in places where your information may be
138.88s - 145.52s |  exposed. What we're not going to do is cover the entire thing that I like to cover. I typically
145.52s - 150.96s |  do this for military members for 90 minutes. You're getting, I don't know, we'll see, maybe
150.96s - 156.72s |  20 minutes now. So I might go fast. If I do go fast, my contact information is going to be at
156.72s - 161.12s |  the end. Please hit me up. Please hit me up. I will answer your questions. I'll give you all
161.12s - 167.84s |  the time that you deserve. So biggest thing, if you take away nothing else from this talk,
168.48s - 174.32s |  is threat modeling. You have your attack surface. That's everything that you use. It is your phone,
174.32s - 179.44s |  your computer, your social media presence, your wireless presence, anything like that.
179.44s - 184.64s |  And then you have your threat profile. Those are the people that are after you. Those are anybody
184.64s - 189.52s |  that can benefit from getting your information. If I am going to attack your attack surface,
189.52s - 193.92s |  it's because I want something that you have. I am part of your threat profile. It's different
193.92s - 199.36s |  for everybody. A school teacher has a different threat profile than a school student. A computer
199.36s - 205.52s |  user at home has a much different threat profile than someone that's a computer user at an airport.
205.52s - 209.28s |  So that's something that you need to square away with is what is your attack surface? What does
209.28s - 214.40s |  it look like? What do you use? And then who's after it? This all comes down to the operation
214.48s - 220.08s |  security process. And this is something that we should all be living with. Operation security,
220.08s - 226.08s |  or OPSEC, is a cycle. You identify what your vulnerabilities are, your attack surface.
226.08s - 232.72s |  You identify who's after it, your threat profile. You look at what would happen if they exploited
232.72s - 239.28s |  that vulnerability. And then you do your risk analysis. Not every vulnerability needs to be
239.28s - 244.08s |  patched. Some of them carry a really low risk. I use a cell phone. Cell phones are full of
244.08s - 251.20s |  vulnerabilities. If I stop using a cell phone, am I safe? Well, maybe, maybe not. But you completely
251.20s - 255.28s |  lose the benefit of using a cell phone. So you're not going to stop using your cell phone, right?
255.28s - 260.24s |  You're going to accept that risk. When you accept that risk, then you need to think about, well,
260.24s - 265.12s |  what if the adversary did exploit me? How could I mitigate some of the worst issues of losing my
265.12s - 270.08s |  cell phone or getting it compromised? And then you put mitigations in place. You put defenses
270.08s - 274.72s |  in place. Maybe you change the way you use it a little bit. That's the OPSEC process. But the
274.72s - 279.84s |  important thing is, it's a mindset. It's something that you constantly do. It's going to become
279.84s - 283.84s |  second nature after a while. Everything that you do, you're going to think about it. What
283.84s - 288.64s |  risk does this pose? How does it increase or decrease my attack surface? How does it change
288.64s - 296.16s |  my threat model? So let's start off. These are things that you can do without traveling. You
296.16s - 300.72s |  could be sitting in your home and you can do these things and it'll still reduce your attack surface.
301.36s - 305.28s |  This audience, I don't have to explain to you what MFA is, password managers. I don't need to
305.28s - 311.12s |  go through that. You all already know what this is. It's been shoved down your throats so many
311.12s - 317.04s |  times over the past decade. Long, complicated passwords. Use a password manager. Multi-factor
317.04s - 321.76s |  authentication is going to stop a lot of these attacks. If you can use a PIN or a password,
321.76s - 326.80s |  definitely use it. If for some reason you happen to be traveling and you lose your phone, you lose
326.80s - 333.44s |  your computer, some applications allow you to have a standalone PIN or password that you use
333.44s - 338.40s |  to activate or to access that app, even if it's still on your device and your device is unlocked.
338.40s - 343.20s |  It's a good second layer of defense. I would definitely recommend that. Backups are a good
343.20s - 347.76s |  thing that a lot of people don't think about. If your devices are lost, stolen, or confiscated and
347.76s - 353.12s |  you need to recover, you can recover. My favorite way to back things up is putting it on a thumb
353.12s - 358.56s |  drive, leaving it somewhere like in my house, somewhere where I can access it, copying a second
358.56s - 364.40s |  thumb drive, maybe leaving it in my car. And if I really want overkill, I maybe backup stuff to a
364.40s - 368.80s |  third thumb drive and I leave it at a friend's or a relative's house. Because what if my car gets
368.80s - 373.68s |  broken into? What if my house burns down? I still have that third backup. You'll probably be thinking
373.68s - 379.12s |  about other things than re-imaging your computer or phone if your house burns down, but it's still
379.12s - 383.28s |  some peace of mind. One less thing you need to worry about. And then the last thing is end-to-end
383.28s - 389.20s |  encrypted chat and calling. This reduces your attack surface a lot. And I would normally spend
389.20s - 393.68s |  three slides talking to people about how to choose one. Are you going to choose WhatsApp? Are you going
393.68s - 398.88s |  to use Signal, Wire, Telegram? What is it going to be? I'm not going to sell you any apps. I'm not
398.88s - 404.24s |  going to give you recommendations. For all I know, Signal protocol gets broken tomorrow and I don't
404.24s - 408.80s |  want you going home thinking, oh man, Gray Fox told me to use Signal. What a jerk. So I'm not going to
408.80s - 413.36s |  do that. But what I will say is work with your ecosystem. If you're in an environment where
413.36s - 419.60s |  everyone else is using WhatsApp, use WhatsApp. Because app fatigue is a thing. Don't try to get
419.60s - 423.44s |  everyone to go with what you use. It's an uphill battle and you're probably going to lose that
423.44s - 429.84s |  battle. Really what you want to have in mind is thinking like the adversary. Using your OPSEC.
429.84s - 436.00s |  Every keystroke. There is a potential for every keystroke to be exposed. You could be using the
436.00s - 440.48s |  most secure thing in the entire world, but what if there's malware on your device that gets around
440.48s - 445.76s |  the encryption? So just think about it before you type it, before you say it. Blinky boxes are great,
445.76s - 449.04s |  but the technology is not going to save you. Your brain is going to save you.
450.96s - 457.04s |  Social media is another one. We're getting away from what you carry and now into what
457.04s - 461.76s |  your presence looks like. If I'm the adversary and I want to build an intelligence dossier on you,
462.88s - 466.88s |  damn sure I'm going to go to your LinkedIn, your Facebook, your Instagram,
466.88s - 470.40s |  wherever you have a presence, I'm going to find you and I'm going to put it together.
470.40s - 474.00s |  Every photograph that you post, I'm not only going to look at your face, I'm going to look at who
474.00s - 477.84s |  you're standing next to. I'm going to look at what's in the background. I'm going to look at
477.84s - 482.96s |  the date, time group, and I'm going to put together a pattern of life and a pattern of movement and a
482.96s - 488.00s |  pattern of communication. All of these things I can get from your social media. And the more that
488.00s - 493.60s |  I can get as an adversary about how you live and how you travel, the better I can determine if I
493.60s - 498.64s |  were a foreign intelligence, where I can possibly sit next to you and try to solicit you, get
498.64s - 504.16s |  information from you, maybe even try to turn you to my side. It's really nuanced, really,
504.16s - 508.72s |  really nuanced, but definitely go and take a look at what your social media presence looks like.
509.60s - 514.16s |  See if you were investigating yourself, what could you put together? It's pretty eye-opening.
514.16s - 518.40s |  I'm not saying get rid of your Facebook account. You don't have to do that, but I'm just saying
518.40s - 524.08s |  use it a little bit better. This is when you start getting into open source intelligence.
524.08s - 528.48s |  If you really want to see what your internet footprint looks like, use some of these resources.
528.48s - 534.40s |  See what's out there. These are all accessible to me. I can get you from these. If you can get
534.40s - 538.56s |  yourself from these, great. Even if you can't get rid of that information and deleting your
538.56s - 545.12s |  data off the internet is extremely hard. It's really time consuming. It may be a Sisyphean
545.12s - 549.76s |  task because whether you delete it in one place or not, it'll appear in another place. It's like
549.76s - 554.08s |  playing whack-a-mole, but at least you're aware that it's out there. If you know that it's out
554.08s - 559.28s |  there, you can put other mitigations in place. You can maybe alter some of your routines. Maybe
559.28s - 564.48s |  stop using an app. Maybe think a little bit more about whether you tag something, giving your
564.48s - 569.76s |  location out, stuff like that. It's an extremely useful exercise to think like the enemy and see
569.76s - 577.60s |  what you can find on you. Now let's talk about phones. I hate phones. I hate them. I hate them
577.60s - 583.52s |  because I absolutely need it. And it always, always tries to bite me. Always. You have so many
583.52s - 588.80s |  radio genes on a typical phone that there's no way to tamp it down. But there are some things that
588.80s - 593.60s |  you can do to try to mitigate the risk. All of the signals that your phone is going to put out
593.60s - 598.24s |  is collected by the operating system. It's collected by whatever's providing you internet
598.24s - 603.44s |  access. Every single application is trying to access all the way down to the kernel level,
603.44s - 609.84s |  all the inner workings of your device. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, anything. If you're connected to something,
609.84s - 615.68s |  it wants your location. If I'm the adversary, getting your email's fine. Getting your
615.68s - 621.52s |  communications are good. I got some content and photos. Great. I might even get some file access.
622.16s - 627.52s |  But if I get your location, if I know where you are, that's my bread and butter. Because then I
627.52s - 632.56s |  know where I can find you. I know who you're meeting with. And I know for how long. And I'm
632.56s - 638.64s |  developing that pattern of life. Foreign intelligence, security services, FIS, they're the ones that are
638.64s - 644.56s |  typically after my clients, foreign military members. You can't really do much if you just
644.56s - 649.76s |  track them online. What's the end point? The end point is to try to solicit them in person.
649.76s - 654.48s |  This is a means to an end. I can't do that without location. That's when I start getting into
654.48s - 660.16s |  wireless anti-tracking. If I can try to tamp down how much my phone is giving out my location,
660.16s - 666.56s |  then that's what I'm going to go for. The reason why location is so dangerous is because it is the
666.56s - 672.96s |  business model for your device. So the way that advertising works is you use an application for
672.96s - 678.64s |  free. It's got to get paid for somehow. And so it follows this cycle. The organization that made
678.64s - 683.60s |  your app is collecting your data. It's selling it to a data broker. Data broker sells that to
683.60s - 688.56s |  advertisers. Advertisers send you advertisements. And every click is going to be more money.
688.56s - 693.28s |  It's a cycle, but it's innocuous. They're not the enemy. They're not trying to go after you.
693.28s - 697.92s |  But the problem is when you're making money from advertising, you're not making any money from
697.92s - 704.72s |  security. So that's why this is so bad. They're not trying to get after you. But if somebody
704.72s - 709.76s |  breaches those data and all of your collected information is out there, your location is out
709.76s - 715.04s |  there. And I, as the adversary, can buy it or I can steal it or I could just go open source and I
715.04s - 720.08s |  could find it somewhere for free anyway. So that's why it's a goldmine for someone like me.
720.64s - 724.24s |  That's why your phones are so dangerous. It's all about the location. It's all about the
724.24s - 730.88s |  advertising system. Can you get around it? Yeah, you can mitigate a lot of this. And we'll start
730.88s - 737.20s |  getting into that. Smart cities are becoming more and more prevalent. UTS or ubiquitous technical
737.20s - 742.64s |  surveillance is a reality. If you live in the United States, you're seeing these things pop
742.64s - 747.60s |  up more and more. If you live overseas, it's already what you live in. You have cameras
747.60s - 753.04s |  everywhere with facial recognition as your edge computing. So it doesn't really matter one way
753.04s - 757.12s |  or another if you have a mainframe or something like that that has all your faces in it. These
757.12s - 761.44s |  cameras can automatically use algorithms to detect your face. It's instantaneous.
762.72s - 768.40s |  ShotSpotter is a neat technology that takes audio from surrounding areas and it tries to correlate
768.40s - 773.36s |  that audio with gunshots and then it alerts law enforcement. So you have video and you have sound.
774.00s - 779.04s |  You have tag readers, license plate readers all over the place that'll read where your vehicle
779.04s - 784.72s |  is going. You also have point of sale systems. If any of you use touchless payment with your phone,
784.72s - 791.52s |  that's being collected as well. All of these things ostensibly are being collected anonymously,
791.52s - 795.68s |  but in order for them to work with the vast amount of collection that they need to do,
795.68s - 800.80s |  there's not a lot of overhead for security. So once again, just like the advertising system,
800.80s - 805.12s |  you're looking at something that is breachable. You're looking at anonymous data that can be
805.12s - 810.64s |  easily de-anonymized. So ubiquitous technical surveillance in a smart city is going to be
810.64s - 814.88s |  the enemy in this case. It doesn't want to be your enemy. It wants to do good. It wants to
814.88s - 820.80s |  alert a fire department when there's a fire. But as an adversary, you can weaponize these data.
821.60s - 825.92s |  So how do you get around it? If you want to take a picture of this slide, go for it because I'm not
825.92s - 829.36s |  going to explain everything. We don't have the time for that. But there are simple things that
829.36s - 834.24s |  you can do to mitigate. The biggest thing you can do is turning off some of those radio chains on
834.24s - 839.76s |  your devices, specifically Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Wireless sensors are everywhere. If you don't put
839.76s - 844.72s |  out a wireless signal, I won't be able to get you. It's not 100%, but it comes close.
845.28s - 849.04s |  Same thing with your web browsers. If you use an ad blocker or if you put on strict cookie
849.04s - 853.52s |  protection, you should be okay. There's recent news that Firefox was kind of lying and not
853.52s - 858.56s |  really blocking your third-party cookies. You can go into your custom settings in Firefox and you
858.56s - 864.96s |  can customize blocking cookies. I think that kind of goes around that just overall strict problem.
864.96s - 871.28s |  But I would recommend something like uBlock Origin for the time that it still works. It's a pretty
872.24s - 876.64s |  good add-on that I think does the job of getting rid of a lot of those cookies, especially the ones
876.64s - 882.48s |  that collect location data. When you're looking at payment systems, cash is still king. If you
882.48s - 887.20s |  pay with cash, you're good. There is a camera that sees your face. There's probably audio that
887.20s - 892.72s |  will recognize your voice. But at least what you're paying and what you're buying might still
892.72s - 897.28s |  be a little bit of a secret, at least for now. And then lastly, if you're looking at your cars,
897.60s - 901.44s |  it's difficult. If you want a good car, it's going to be connected. It'll have many radio
901.44s - 908.24s |  chains. But do yourself a favor. Try to refrain from connecting your phone to your car because
908.24s - 912.64s |  the car is not just accessing your music. It's not just accessing apps and stuff like that
912.64s - 920.00s |  for navigation. It's also accessing usernames, contacts, call history, SMS history. And cars,
920.00s - 924.32s |  the security are not great in a car. So if I were to hack into a car, I would probably
925.04s - 929.84s |  in a car. So if I were to hack into a car, I basically have what is also on your phone,
929.84s - 934.40s |  especially when you're renting a car. Think about that. Think about the wireless implications of
934.40s - 939.04s |  tethering a device. So we can get into that. We could spend an hour. I don't have an hour.
939.04s - 944.32s |  I wish I did. So now let's get into a little bit more physical security stuff.
944.96s - 948.56s |  When you're going through any security checkpoints, I'm talking about airports,
948.56s - 954.56s |  rail, whatever, turn your devices off, completely cold. Even with the best forensics equipment,
954.56s - 959.36s |  something that is turned off, what we call a cold state, would be extremely hard to get into,
959.36s - 965.84s |  especially if it's a modern operating system. Android 13-ish and up, the latest iOS,
967.76s - 971.84s |  they all use file-based encryption, which forensically is a lot harder than full disk
971.84s - 976.64s |  encryption. If you have your device turned off, I as an adversary would have a hard time getting
976.64s - 981.28s |  into that device. If I only have you for 20 minutes in secondary at an airport, that's not
981.28s - 986.24s |  enough time to crack anything. If your device is locked but it's turned on, we call that a warm
986.24s - 991.60s |  state. Depending on the operating system and the version, maybe I can brute force your pin. If you
991.60s - 996.96s |  use a six-digit pin or higher, that would take too long. If you have your phone on and unlocked, well
996.96s - 1003.12s |  then, physical possession is always going to be the king and queen here. So if you don't have it
1003.12s - 1009.12s |  locked, that's on you, I got everything. So do yourself a favor, turn it off. If you have it on
1009.12s - 1013.52s |  your person and not in a bag, that's a bonus. Most places, when they pull you into secondary,
1013.52s - 1017.68s |  they're not going to search your body, they may search your bags. So do yourself a favor.
1018.72s - 1022.40s |  Another thing to keep in mind, and this is a little bit more advanced, if you're worried about
1022.40s - 1027.28s |  your phone or your computer being compromised and you have sensitive stuff in a chat app or over
1027.28s - 1032.32s |  email, uninstall that app before you go through the security checkpoint, because then there's no
1032.32s - 1036.72s |  evidence that it was there unless they do a full forensic rip. And if that's the case, you probably
1036.72s - 1040.80s |  have bigger problems than what the content was. But that's just something a lot of people don't
1040.80s - 1044.96s |  really take into account. You're not going to lose all your data if you uninstall the app. When you're
1044.96s - 1049.28s |  finished, you get everything back, you reinstall it, you're okay. But just keep those little tidbits
1049.28s - 1055.20s |  in mind. Security checkpoints, they're a minefield. Ask me how I know. I would also avoid doing any
1055.20s - 1059.12s |  dummy devices, because eventually they'll look at your phone that's a dummy phone and be like, oh,
1059.12s - 1064.08s |  there's nothing on here. That's strange. Then they may ask to search some other things. And
1064.08s - 1068.32s |  if they find your real phone, that's going to raise a couple more questions. Don't increase
1068.32s - 1072.72s |  your attack surface. Don't give yourself another bullseye. Avoid the whole dummy phone and dummy
1072.72s - 1079.68s |  computer thing. All right. Inevitably, I get asked about VPNs. This is probably the only really
1079.68s - 1087.04s |  technical conversation I'm going to get into here. A VPN is simple. It is a tunnel that encrypts data.
1087.04s - 1092.24s |  That's all it does. A lot of people use that for privacy. It's not private. It's more for security
1092.24s - 1097.68s |  than anything else. Commercial VPNs, stuff that your company would issue you, it gives you a tunnel
1097.68s - 1102.72s |  where you can work in their network, in their corporate infrastructure. That's what a virtual
1102.72s - 1108.48s |  private network is. You're virtually part of that private network. Off-the-shelf VPNs like NordVPN,
1108.48s - 1113.76s |  Proton, all those, what they essentially do is give you a tunnel from your end user device
1113.76s - 1119.12s |  to another server somewhere else that has a different IP address. Between your end user
1119.12s - 1124.40s |  device and that server, you have some pretty good encryption. If I were trying to sniff packets in
1124.40s - 1129.84s |  the air, I would just get a bunch of nonsense. But as soon as your traffic leaves this VPN server,
1129.84s - 1135.60s |  it is you. It is ostensibly you. Everything you're doing, all the sites you're going to,
1135.60s - 1140.40s |  any other traffic, it's all out there. It can be de-anonymized, especially if you're logging into
1140.40s - 1145.20s |  things using a username associated with you. The benefit of a VPN is that it changes your
1145.20s - 1150.80s |  location. Your perceived location over the internet changes. That's the good thing about a VPN.
1150.80s - 1156.88s |  So if I was in Somalia and I wanted to watch US Netflix, I VPN to a US server. I watch Netflix.
1156.88s - 1161.92s |  But it doesn't mean that somebody in the US that sees my traffic wouldn't be able to attack me.
1161.92s - 1167.04s |  They would just have a false impression of where I am. That's all a VPN does. It's a good security
1167.04s - 1171.20s |  measure. It's good for defense in depth. It is not an end-all be-all. It won't protect you from
1171.20s - 1177.28s |  malware, phishing, all the other bad things that are out there. I just want to make that clear
1177.28s - 1181.84s |  because I get a lot of questions about, will a VPN save me? It depends on who you're running away
1181.84s - 1187.44s |  from, but probably not. So other questions about VPNs definitely hit me up offline.
1188.88s - 1192.16s |  So let's cover what we went through in the very, very short time that I had.
1192.80s - 1198.16s |  We have physical security aspects. No location means I can't find you. I think that that's
1198.16s - 1204.08s |  relatively secure. You can't block all location, but you can try. Your online security. If you try
1204.08s - 1209.12s |  to target you on social media, you'll find where your vulnerabilities are and you can mitigate that.
1209.12s - 1215.60s |  Definitely OSINT yourself. For communication security, end-to-end encryption is what we got
1215.60s - 1220.88s |  and it works. If all of you could reverse engineer the apps that you use, we'd be golden, but you
1220.88s - 1226.72s |  can't. There's got to be some level of trust, but I would say if you're doing regular telephony like
1227.36s - 1232.16s |  your standard phone calls and your standard SMS, a lot less security than using something like
1232.16s - 1238.32s |  WhatsApp, Signal, Wire, Session, anything like that. So consider end-to-end encryption for your
1238.32s - 1244.96s |  communications. All right. Maybe I have time for questions. I think I have like, what,
1244.96s - 1250.64s |  just a few minutes. If you want to reach out to me, please reach out to me. That QR code,
1251.76s - 1255.68s |  I'm looking at people that are clicking it and I'm trying to make a note of like, did you really
1255.68s - 1259.12s |  do your threat model with this? But it's okay. You can click it. It's fine. I'm not going to come
1259.12s - 1264.16s |  after you. Those are some books and some websites that I recommend for further learning, but
1264.16s - 1267.92s |  definitely reach out to me if you have any questions because I am sorry this is very short,
1267.92s - 1279.06s |  but I hope you got something out of it and thanks very much. And I think I have two minutes. I have
1279.06s - 1283.14s |  two minutes if anyone has anything they want to ask. And please keep in mind, I lost my hearing
1283.14s - 1290.67s |  in the war. So please speak up if you're going to ask anything. I don't see any brave souls.
1292.67s - 1307.60s |  Yes, sir. You may be compelled to get an email from me if you email me because the email address
1307.60s - 1311.84s |  is also in the QR code and then you'll have to have a conversation with me. And I don't know
1311.84s - 1319.47s |  how that's going to go. That's up to you, but you're a brave soul. All right. Please come find
1319.47s - 1323.31s |  me. I'm probably going to be hanging out in Crypto Privacy Village if you want to have a chat.
1323.31s - 1325.87s |  And once again, thank you very much for sitting through this.
