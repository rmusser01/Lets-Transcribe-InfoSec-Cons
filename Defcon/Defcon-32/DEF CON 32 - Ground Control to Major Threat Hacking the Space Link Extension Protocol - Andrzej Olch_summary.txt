**Introduction to Space Security Concerns**
- **Space missions and security breaches**: Increasing discussions around satellite hacks and security.
- **Software Defined Radio**: Not practical for most adversaries due to resource requirements and detectability.
- **Ground Segment vulnerabilities**: More practical target for adversaries.

**Space Missions and Infrastructure**
- **Custom-made hardware and software**: Integral to critical infrastructure.
- **Protocols and standards**: Designed for space mission interactions.

**Space Link Extension Protocol (SLE)**
- **SLE protocol**: Standard for communication between mission data systems and ground stations.
- **Security concerns**: Addressed in the study.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Methods and techniques demonstrated for exploiting SLE.

**Comparison of Space and Ground Segments**
- **Space Segment**: Complex but small attack surface due to single entry point.
- **Ground Segment**: Less complex but larger attack surface with many available components.
- **Environmental challenges**: Include visibility, orbit, and distance from Earth.

**SLE Protocol Details**
- **Developed by CCSDS**: Used for sending telecommands and receiving telemetry.
- **Based on TCP/IP**: Supports transport layer, encoding, and authentication.
- **Roles**: SLE provider (ground station) and SLE user (mission control system).

**Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Methods**
- **Lack of data privacy and encryption**: Makes SLE susceptible to various attacks.
- **ARP spoofing**: Used for man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Replay attacks**: Possible due to lack of encryption.

**Mitigation Strategies**
- **Space data link security**: Proposed by CCSDS for spacecraft-ground station communication.
- **CCSDS PKI concept**: Suggested for enabling TSL-like features at the ISP level.

**Research and Future Work**
- **Collaboration with European Space Agency**: Additional tests and discussions ongoing.
- **Publication availability**: Details available on the website mentioned in the presentation.
