 So this is a talk about locksport competitions.
2.60s - 4.80s |  We're going to talk about how you compete,
4.80s - 6.80s |  what the competitions are like, how you get good,
6.80s - 8.00s |  all those kinds of fun things.
8.00s - 13.10s |  So here's our quick agenda, a little bit about who I am,
13.10s - 14.80s |  who this guy next to me is.
14.80s - 16.50s |  We'll talk about what locksport actually
16.50s - 18.60s |  is, the different types of competitions,
18.60s - 21.50s |  and where we go to do these things.
21.50s - 23.60s |  So me, I'm Matt Burrow.
23.60s - 27.50s |  I am a red team manager by day, on the weekends, and at night.
27.60s - 30.00s |  I am also a co-organizer for Seattle Locksport.
30.00s - 34.28s |  So shout out to all the Seattle people in the front.
34.28s - 36.88s |  If you're in the Seattle area ever, feel free to come by.
36.88s - 38.88s |  We meet a couple times a month, have a lot of fun,
38.88s - 39.68s |  teach you how to pick locks.
39.68s - 40.58s |  It's great.
40.58s - 42.18s |  I've also written a couple of books.
42.18s - 45.48s |  The most important one here is Locksport, came out this year.
45.48s - 47.08s |  There I am on the cover.
47.08s - 49.88s |  I have a co-author here with me as well from Locksport.
49.88s - 53.38s |  If you want to come by the No Starch Press vendor booth
53.38s - 56.58s |  at 2.30 today, we will be signing copies of the book.
56.58s - 58.38s |  And I've competed in locksport competitions
58.38s - 61.48s |  around the world since about 2016.
61.48s - 65.18s |  With me here, I have Jos Valles.
65.18s - 67.48s |  Good day.
67.48s - 69.38s |  I'm Jos Valles, and like it says on the screen,
69.38s - 72.98s |  I do security stuff as a day job.
72.98s - 76.28s |  I used to be the president for tool.nl.
76.28s - 78.08s |  That's the original tool, by the way.
78.08s - 81.18s |  And, well, I wrote the book, but yada, yada, yada.
81.18s - 85.28s |  And I've been into locksport for quite some while now.
85.28s - 90.28s |  In 2006, I was my first dabble in competing.
90.28s - 93.78s |  And three years after that, I decided to start winning.
93.78s - 95.68s |  And, yeah, that's basically what happened.
95.68s - 101.09s |  So, yeah, I mean, that's it.
101.09s - 101.69s |  Take this one?
101.69s - 102.19s |  Yeah.
102.19s - 103.69s |  Yeah, there you go.
103.69s - 104.19s |  Cool.
104.19s - 106.19s |  So what is locksport?
106.19s - 108.49s |  Notice the sport in particular.
108.49s - 111.09s |  Definition of locksport, it is non-destructive opening
111.09s - 114.79s |  of locks in a manner that the manufacturer never intended.
114.79s - 117.49s |  And we do this as a hobby and as a competition
117.49s - 119.19s |  to see who can do it the fastest.
119.19s - 122.29s |  And notice we didn't say lock picking, but opening of locks.
122.29s - 125.79s |  That's an important distinction, and you'll see why in a minute.
125.79s - 127.19s |  So why do we do this, right?
127.19s - 128.39s |  What makes us tick?
128.39s - 131.69s |  Why do we go travel around the world to do these things?
131.69s - 134.39s |  Any of us, I think, who are into locksport for any amount of time
134.39s - 135.59s |  see locks as a fun puzzle.
135.59s - 136.29s |  It's a challenge.
136.29s - 137.89s |  It's something you want to defeat.
137.89s - 140.79s |  Just like hacking digitally, it's analog hacking, right?
140.79s - 142.49s |  It's a fun thing to do.
142.49s - 145.09s |  We also do it because we want to improve on our own skills.
145.09s - 146.69s |  We want to show that we're the best.
146.69s - 148.49s |  We want to set a personal best for ourselves.
148.49s - 150.89s |  Maybe we want to brag to our friends or maybe mock them a little bit.
150.89s - 154.09s |  So always good to show off to your friends and enemies.
154.09s - 155.59s |  You could maybe get famous from this.
155.59s - 159.49s |  Maybe not super famous, but you've probably all heard of LPL,
159.49s - 160.89s |  very famous locksporter.
160.89s - 163.79s |  There's several people who are well-known in the locksport community
163.79s - 167.19s |  and even beyond that that regular normal non-DEF CON people have heard of.
167.19s - 169.19s |  So you could maybe get famous.
169.19s - 170.89s |  And then there are prizes.
170.89s - 171.69s |  What kinds of prizes?
171.69s - 173.39s |  Well, locks often.
173.39s - 174.79s |  You can win trophies.
174.79s - 177.89s |  You can win lock-picking gear, all kinds of fun things.
177.89s - 181.69s |  Here we are winning at various things or at least placing.
181.69s - 185.49s |  So it's fun to get recognized for doing something well.
185.49s - 187.09s |  So yeah, come compete.
187.09s - 189.49s |  You can win things.
189.49s - 192.59s |  All right, brief history of locksport, how it got started.
192.59s - 196.49s |  Locksmiths have been picking locks and opening locks without keys forever.
196.49s - 198.19s |  That's kind of their job.
198.19s - 202.99s |  Starting in the 60s, there was the Model Railroad Club at MIT.
202.99s - 205.69s |  They started kind of getting into places, wanting to pick locks.
205.69s - 208.69s |  So a lot of it kind of spun out from there.
208.69s - 211.89s |  Then in Europe, locksport really started taking off in the late 90s.
211.89s - 216.29s |  SSDev in Germany was founded by people from the Chaos Computing Club.
216.29s - 217.69s |  They met with people from Hope.
217.69s - 220.49s |  And so then it kind of came to the US.
220.49s - 224.89s |  In the Netherlands, we had the Dutch NVHS,
224.89s - 227.89s |  which was the Dutch Association for Hinges and Locksport,
227.89s - 231.19s |  which is also kind of a funny joke if you know Dutch.
231.19s - 234.59s |  That then spun off into becoming TOOL, the original TOOL,
234.59s - 237.29s |  TOOL-NL in 2002.
237.29s - 240.29s |  And then from there, they had their first LOCKCON that year,
240.29s - 244.19s |  which is, we'll talk about a very big competition and gathering of lock picking
244.19s - 246.29s |  and various lock opening things in the Netherlands.
246.29s - 247.49s |  It's awesome.
247.49s - 249.29s |  And then eventually that trickled down into the US
249.29s - 253.49s |  and TOOL-US was started around 2006 at Hope and then DEFCON that year.
253.49s - 255.59s |  So that's the very brief history of locksport.
255.59s - 262.09s |  So it's been going on now for, you know, 20, 30 years as a major sport.
262.09s - 264.69s |  So I mentioned that lock picking is not the only thing.
264.69s - 267.99s |  So there are various kinds of competitions that we have at all these big events.
267.99s - 270.29s |  So we'll talk about the different kinds of competitions, what they're like,
270.29s - 273.79s |  and then we'll talk about where you can go and do these things.
273.79s - 277.69s |  So, of course, lock picking is the biggest event at all these various conferences
277.69s - 279.69s |  because that's what people think of when they think of locksport.
279.69s - 283.09s |  It is the primary competition, but certainly not the only one.
283.19s - 285.59s |  If you don't know about lock picking, walk through that curtain.
285.59s - 287.29s |  You will be taught lock picking in five minutes.
287.29s - 289.59s |  You'll open locks. It will be fun.
289.59s - 290.59s |  If you know a bit about lock picking,
290.59s - 293.09s |  what is it actually like to compete and do these things?
293.09s - 294.79s |  We all gather at a conference.
294.79s - 296.59s |  There are usually big round tables,
296.59s - 299.49s |  often with like five to ten people sitting at these tables.
299.49s - 300.69s |  Everyone gets a lock.
300.69s - 304.19s |  You usually get about five minutes per lock to try to pick that lock.
304.19s - 307.19s |  You record your time if you open it or did not open if you don't.
307.19s - 309.19s |  After the five minutes, they say switch.
309.19s - 311.39s |  You hand it to the person on your left or the person on your right.
311.39s - 312.99s |  All the locks move around the table.
312.99s - 315.89s |  You see how quickly you can open or how many locks you can open.
315.89s - 318.99s |  The person at the table with the most opens moves on to the final round.
318.99s - 321.49s |  Or if there's a tie, the person with the best cumulative time.
321.49s - 322.99s |  And then there's a final round table.
322.99s - 324.99s |  Same story. Pass the locks around.
324.99s - 326.49s |  Usually harder locks in that round.
326.49s - 328.49s |  And then you get your top three people.
328.49s - 330.99s |  That's most lock picking competitions.
330.99s - 332.69s |  So what does that look like?
332.69s - 334.89s |  Here's me opening a lock at LockCon.
334.89s - 338.39s |  Here's other people opening locks at LockFest, which is another great event.
338.39s - 339.89s |  So yeah, sit at a table.
339.89s - 340.99s |  You know, have a drink.
340.99s - 342.59s |  Pick locks. Record your time.
342.59s - 344.09s |  Lots of fun.
344.09s - 346.19s |  Then there's Impressioning.
346.19s - 347.69s |  We have the world expert in Impressioning.
347.69s - 349.69s |  So I'll hand off to him.
349.69s - 351.29s |  Again, hello.
351.29s - 355.79s |  Like Matt said, there are several competitions that are run around the world.
355.79s - 357.09s |  One of them is Impressioning.
357.09s - 358.19s |  What is Impressioning?
358.19s - 359.59s |  Well, Impressioning is opening locks.
359.59s - 362.99s |  Otherwise, it wouldn't be part of a locksport.
362.99s - 365.99s |  What Impressioning is, is the art of making a key
365.99s - 369.09s |  without knowing what the key exactly looks like.
369.09s - 373.69s |  So we're creating a key from scratch.
373.69s - 374.49s |  How do we do that?
374.49s - 378.39s |  We work from a uncut blank key.
378.39s - 384.19s |  So like the keys hanging at your key duplication site.
384.19s - 385.39s |  You take a blank key.
385.39s - 386.39s |  You put that in the lock.
386.39s - 387.19s |  It has to fit.
387.19s - 391.59s |  So it has to be the correct type and brand of key.
391.59s - 394.09s |  And you start wiggling that key.
394.09s - 395.29s |  You put some force on it.
395.29s - 401.09s |  And your lock will leave some marks on the key
401.09s - 404.29s |  where the depth of the key is not correct yet.
404.29s - 408.29s |  So if you take out that key and you look at it quite closely,
408.29s - 414.49s |  probably with some lights and some magnifying aids,
414.49s - 417.69s |  then you figure out where the key is not correct yet.
417.69s - 421.39s |  And then you file off just a little bit of material of that part.
421.39s - 422.49s |  And then you rinse and repeat.
422.49s - 423.79s |  Insert the key again.
423.79s - 424.59s |  Start wiggling.
424.59s - 425.49s |  Look at it.
425.49s - 427.99s |  And then you keep on doing that.
427.99s - 430.99s |  And in the end, you'll open.
430.99s - 432.29s |  You need a bit of gear for that.
432.29s - 436.59s |  This happens to be part of my gear.
436.59s - 438.99s |  And it works basically the same, as Matt said,
438.99s - 442.59s |  how the normal picking works, except that everybody
442.59s - 444.19s |  starts at the same time.
444.19s - 447.39s |  So a competition might be, I don't know,
447.39s - 449.09s |  30 people in one room.
449.09s - 451.39s |  Everybody gets the same lock.
451.39s - 453.79s |  So the lock, same brand.
453.79s - 455.29s |  But they're also keyed alike.
455.29s - 458.59s |  We have no idea what the key is, but they're keyed alike.
458.59s - 463.19s |  Because if the cut would be shallow for me,
463.19s - 466.49s |  and Matt would be handed a deeper lock,
466.49s - 469.59s |  then he has to put in more work.
469.59s - 471.99s |  Because you have to recycle through this process
471.99s - 473.39s |  over and over and over again.
473.39s - 475.59s |  And also filing more.
475.59s - 477.79s |  So to keep it a level playing field,
477.79s - 480.19s |  everybody has the same lock.
480.19s - 481.69s |  And then it's 3, 2, 1, go.
481.69s - 485.69s |  And people start abusing their locks to get them open.
485.69s - 487.59s |  A competition, a normal competition,
487.59s - 490.19s |  first round takes about an hour.
490.19s - 493.69s |  And the first maybe six, depending on where you are,
493.69s - 499.09s |  the first six to open go in, progress to the final round.
499.09s - 503.09s |  Which means they get six different locks.
503.09s - 504.29s |  And they open them.
504.29s - 506.69s |  And then you do that in a roundabout way,
506.69s - 508.39s |  same as with the picking.
508.39s - 511.89s |  So all the finalists open, they're all six locks.
511.89s - 514.99s |  And then we figure out who opened the most.
514.99s - 516.29s |  That person will win.
516.29s - 519.39s |  And if that's a tie, then we're looking at times.
519.39s - 524.89s |  And looking at times, of looking at marks,
524.89s - 526.89s |  what are we actually looking for?
526.89s - 531.29s |  Well, so we're filing those keys.
531.29s - 534.09s |  We normally use round files for it, but that's all technical.
534.09s - 537.09s |  So your key will look weirdish
537.09s - 540.79s |  if you look at the shape of the cuts because those are round.
540.79s - 543.09s |  But that's also, for me, that's a good thing
543.09s - 545.19s |  because that means that the bottom of that cut
545.19s - 549.19s |  will be smooth instead of a sharp valley.
549.19s - 552.69s |  And then you can actually way easier hunt for marks there.
552.69s - 555.79s |  And you can see at the bottom of those two pictures,
555.79s - 558.79s |  you can see quite distinct marks in this case.
558.79s - 560.49s |  They're not always that clear.
560.49s - 563.09s |  But well, for pictures, this is good.
563.09s - 565.19s |  So yeah, it's a hand file.
565.19s - 569.29s |  And like I said, first round is about an hour.
569.29s - 573.79s |  And mostly about a half of the field will open within that a lot of time.
573.79s - 579.20s |  Some people will be a bit faster.
579.20s - 580.50s |  That's a law.
580.50s - 584.10s |  Order of magnitude or so faster, maybe.
584.10s - 585.40s |  Yeah, and then what other kinds of competitions?
585.40s - 588.50s |  So there's also safe manipulation or safe cracking, if you will.
588.50s - 591.40s |  But here we don't have the entire safe shipping.
591.40s - 595.30s |  Big metal boxes to competitions would be painful and expensive.
595.40s - 598.60s |  So we just have the actual safe lock mounted on a piece of plastic.
598.60s - 603.20s |  The idea here is to figure out how to open the safe dial in the fastest time,
603.20s - 604.40s |  just like everything else.
604.40s - 605.90s |  How you actually open a safe dial,
605.90s - 608.80s |  it's a bit different than lock picking, than impressioning.
608.80s - 610.00s |  Completely different mechanism, right?
610.00s - 611.70s |  And so the attack is different.
611.70s - 615.20s |  Instead of using straight feel like you would with lock picking,
615.20s - 617.60s |  you're actually using sight and feel combined.
617.60s - 619.90s |  And then you're doing a little bit of math homework,
619.90s - 622.10s |  which is always fun in a competition.
622.10s - 625.50s |  You're building very nice graphs to show how you open the lock.
625.50s - 629.40s |  In competition, there's usually about three locks that are very commonly used.
629.40s - 633.10s |  I'd say the S&G 6730 is by far the most common.
633.10s - 634.60s |  So if you want to start practicing this hobby,
634.60s - 636.30s |  go on eBay and buy yourself one of those.
636.30s - 638.30s |  They're usually about $50.
638.30s - 640.70s |  There's also the Legarde 3300.
640.70s - 642.50s |  That one is a little bit trickier.
642.50s - 645.10s |  But if you want to practice a couple things, that's a good one to try.
645.10s - 648.60s |  And then finally, the Big Red is just kind of the prettiest lock you can buy.
648.60s - 651.30s |  Look, it's got nice red wheels.
651.30s - 654.10s |  So what are we feeling for when we're actually manipulating this lock?
654.10s - 656.70s |  You're dialing a number, and then you're going back.
656.70s - 658.50s |  And if you know anything about how you open an actual safe,
658.50s - 661.30s |  if you know the combination, you would dial, you know, the wheel,
661.30s - 664.70s |  three different numbers, and then you go back to center, back to zero,
664.70s - 668.30s |  and you rotate it, and this nose will drop in.
668.30s - 670.00s |  It's not us. I don't think that's me.
670.00s - 672.40s |  And we'll drop in and retract the bolt here.
672.40s - 674.90s |  You can see the nose has dropped into that brass circle there.
674.90s - 677.60s |  If it's not going to drop in, you'll see it rides along that brass circle,
677.60s - 680.20s |  but then it actually collides with it on both sides.
680.20s - 683.60s |  And where it collides is usually somewhere around 95 and 5.
683.60s - 688.90s |  And so if you try a number, and then you try 95 and 5, try a different number,
688.90s - 691.40s |  feel where those points are hitting.
691.40s - 695.90s |  The closer you get to the correct code, the numbers will actually start to converge
695.90s - 700.50s |  because that nose is actually going a little bit lower into that brass wheel.
700.50s - 705.70s |  And so instead of 95 and 5, eventually you might get 96 and 4.
705.70s - 708.90s |  And that's when you know, okay, I found the correct number for one of those three digits.
708.90s - 711.50s |  So you graph that. You build this graph out.
711.50s - 713.80s |  You find that point, and then there's some tests you can do to figure out
713.80s - 715.50s |  if it's the first, second, or third number.
715.50s - 719.50s |  And then you start dialing the second number or third number until you get it open.
719.50s - 721.10s |  There are some A's you can bring as well,
721.10s - 724.70s |  like this sticker that you see on top of this safe dial you stuck on here.
724.70s - 729.50s |  This gives you very fine gradients because it isn't always quite as clear as 95 to 94.
729.50s - 732.40s |  Sometimes it's 95 to 94.5.
732.40s - 735.50s |  And so this extra lines will help you find that exact number.
735.50s - 739.10s |  So it's a time-consuming process, but some people get very fast at it
739.10s - 742.30s |  and can open locks in, you know, 20 minutes maybe.
742.30s - 746.10s |  In a regular competition with non-professionals spinning the wheels,
746.10s - 749.10s |  it's, you know, two hours is probably a good time.
749.10s - 751.60s |  Usually these competitions run during a larger event.
751.60s - 754.10s |  So you have all day with the lock that you're playing with it
754.10s - 757.10s |  while other people are giving talks or other people competing in other things.
757.10s - 758.00s |  You can keep working on it.
758.00s - 763.00s |  So that's typically how safe manipulation works at these events.
763.10s - 766.60s |  And then finally, another type of competition we see a lot of is lever lock picking.
766.60s - 771.00s |  This is particularly common in Europe where you have the kind of older lever style locks
771.00s - 773.40s |  like you see a lot in England.
773.40s - 775.60s |  Completely different tools, a little bit different skill set,
775.60s - 777.50s |  but you're still basically just picking a lock.
777.50s - 778.50s |  Same ideas.
778.50s - 781.60s |  These locks are also a little bit bigger, a little bit heavier.
781.60s - 782.90s |  So we're not passing them around.
782.90s - 786.60s |  It's more kind of like the impressioning thing where you're sitting at one lock for a while
786.60s - 789.60s |  and you see how fast you get it while other people try the same lock.
789.60s - 791.90s |  Tools are often provided for you for these
791.90s - 795.00s |  because the tools are very specialized per the manufacturer of locks.
795.00s - 799.20s |  So most people aren't carrying around 50 different brands of tools for 50 different kinds of locks.
799.20s - 802.30s |  So whoever is providing the locks for the competition often also provides the tools,
802.30s - 805.60s |  which is a nice perk.
805.60s - 807.60s |  We also have a bunch of crazy events.
807.60s - 812.00s |  And I think there's actually one going on next door like right now, a dozer drill.
812.00s - 815.40s |  But people, of course, get creative at different hacker cons.
815.40s - 816.50s |  They want to try new things.
816.50s - 818.70s |  And so you can find all kinds of different events.
818.70s - 821.80s |  Dozer drill is kind of like what you see a photo of here on the screen.
821.80s - 824.50s |  This is kind of a simulation of a prison escape, right?
824.50s - 825.70s |  You've been locked up.
825.70s - 827.20s |  You need to get yourself out of handcuffs.
827.20s - 829.00s |  And then you need to get yourself out of a jail cell.
829.00s - 831.70s |  And then you need to get into a file cabinet to steal your police record.
831.70s - 835.30s |  And then you need to get into a police car and steal it and drive away.
835.30s - 840.00s |  So there are all kinds of different locks on the table to simulate that kind of escape.
840.00s - 842.30s |  And then there's also different kinds of things like forensic challenges.
842.30s - 844.00s |  Can you pick a lock without leaving marks in it?
844.00s - 845.80s |  Or can you identify the marks that were left in it?
845.90s - 849.00s |  Or can you tell what kind of pins are actually in this lock by feel?
849.00s - 849.70s |  Is that a spool?
849.70s - 850.90s |  Is it serrated?
850.90s - 852.30s |  Those kinds of things.
852.30s - 854.80s |  There's freestyle events, which is like go crazy.
854.80s - 856.00s |  Bring whatever tool you want.
856.00s - 857.20s |  Open the lock however you want.
857.20s - 859.10s |  See how it goes.
859.10s - 860.50s |  As long as it's non-destructive.
860.50s - 860.90s |  Yeah, yeah.
860.90s - 862.20s |  You can't cut the lock in half.
862.20s - 865.40s |  But yeah.
865.40s - 869.80s |  And then key duplication based on a photo rather than having the lock to try.
869.80s - 875.00s |  Kind of like impressioning different kinds of boxes of locks, time blocks.
875.10s - 877.20s |  You see things like under door tool things as well.
877.20s - 880.30s |  Trying to get into buildings just bypassing the lock entirely.
880.30s - 881.60s |  Or pick-tac-toe.
881.60s - 888.40s |  It's something that the Foxpic people put together to pick locks and try to get the fastest, you know, to get three in a row.
888.40s - 890.50s |  So all kinds of really fun, creative things.
890.50s - 895.40s |  We like coming up with different kinds of competitions to always keep it fresh and interesting.
895.40s - 897.70s |  So that brings us to where do you compete?
897.70s - 899.20s |  We've talked about all different kinds of things.
899.20s - 899.50s |  Okay.
899.50s - 900.70s |  So we've gotten you excited about this.
900.70s - 902.40s |  Hopefully you want to come give it a try.
902.40s - 906.60s |  Where can you go to do this other than, you know, in DEF CON in the Lockpick Village?
906.60s - 909.40s |  Well, probably the biggest and best event we'll start with first.
909.40s - 911.60s |  And that's you, since you've run it before.
911.60s - 912.60s |  Yeah.
912.60s - 914.70s |  Hello.
914.70s - 917.50s |  Like Matt said, you can compete, well, basically all over the world.
917.50s - 921.50s |  But the one you really want to compete in and win is LockCon.
921.50s - 926.50s |  So that's considered to be the, well, the Wimbledon of the Lockpick world.
926.50s - 929.20s |  It's one of the oldest competitions there.
929.20s - 933.00s |  It's, well, in the Netherlands, they do the Dutch Open.
933.00s - 933.60s |  It's quite small.
933.60s - 937.70s |  It's about 100 people, but those tend to be from all around the world.
937.70s - 939.00s |  So it's brilliant.
939.00s - 942.00s |  It's mostly, normally it's in October-ish.
942.00s - 945.20s |  Takes about three days, so a long weekend.
945.20s - 947.20s |  Last couple of times it was in a hotel.
947.20s - 949.80s |  And so it's all catered, all done.
949.80s - 956.00s |  And you'll be spending time with a lot of people and a lot of locks during that time.
956.00s - 962.00s |  There will always be, well, just regular picking games.
962.00s - 964.30s |  Impressioning also, definitely.
964.30s - 968.10s |  Most of the time lever locks will do safe manipulation.
968.10s - 971.90s |  Last year we had a car entry.
971.90s - 975.30s |  There's just a lot of, lot of, lot of talks, and they keep on going on and on.
975.30s - 977.70s |  It's really, really brilliant.
977.70s - 980.10s |  It's fun times to be there.
980.10s - 981.90s |  So, yeah, this is the same.
982.00s - 989.90s |  Yeah, this, I mean, competitions, like I said, table to table, and also a lot of talks.
989.90s - 1001.60s |  The picture on the right, that's actually a person that broke out of jail in a South African imprisonment.
1001.60s - 1007.60s |  And yeah, he taught himself how to pick locks and to make tools to pick locks.
1007.60s - 1012.60s |  And that was fun, because normally when he gets invited to talk about this stuff,
1012.60s - 1015.40s |  they talk about how it was to be in prison, this and that.
1015.40s - 1022.20s |  And this was the first time he could speak to a couple of geeks who were geeking out about how he made lockpicks.
1022.20s - 1025.30s |  So that was a very, very fun experience.
1025.30s - 1031.30s |  That's actually one of the very few talks that has been ever recorded at LockOn,
1031.30s - 1036.80s |  because normally it's a non-cabaret event, at least non-publicity.
1036.80s - 1041.40s |  And you tend to only can get in if you know people.
1041.40s - 1047.00s |  So it's, well, it's not that a lot of what happens there is a secret,
1047.00s - 1049.00s |  but a lot of our toys are quite expensive.
1049.00s - 1051.10s |  And we just leave our toys out at night.
1051.10s - 1057.30s |  And yeah, because it's a friendly group and it's a close-knit known group, you can actually do that.
1057.30s - 1061.40s |  But it's a very, very, very fun event.
1061.40s - 1063.50s |  Lockfest.
1063.50s - 1065.80s |  And what are we going to do, lock up our toys?
1065.80s - 1068.10s |  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's locks, right?
1068.10s - 1069.70s |  Yeah, no, and Tim was great.
1069.70s - 1071.60s |  You know, you get some really, really good talks.
1071.60s - 1074.10s |  I enjoy that part of it every year.
1074.10s - 1077.30s |  You know, I think he even had a movie made about him, right?
1077.30s - 1078.90s |  Daniel Radcliffe played him in the movies.
1078.90s - 1080.20s |  Yeah.
1080.20s - 1082.20s |  Yeah, very cool stuff.
1082.20s - 1085.90s |  Cool. So if that's maybe a little too far for your first lockpicking competition,
1085.90s - 1088.90s |  you can look a little bit closer to the U.S. if you're from here.
1088.90s - 1090.60s |  We have Lockfest almost every year.
1090.60s - 1092.00s |  Hopefully we'll have it again next year.
1092.00s - 1094.00s |  There was a pause for COVID.
1094.10s - 1095.90s |  It's been in Seattle a number of years.
1095.90s - 1098.20s |  I don't know where the next one will be, but hopefully soon.
1098.20s - 1100.50s |  Go tell tool people you want to have Lockfest back.
1100.50s - 1101.90s |  Make it happen.
1101.90s - 1104.00s |  It's usually, again, a weekend-long event.
1104.00s - 1104.90s |  There's lockpicking.
1104.90s - 1106.70s |  There's safe opening.
1106.70s - 1110.10s |  Here you can see the timed competition that I built with a couple of folks
1110.10s - 1113.60s |  and people compete on to see how quickly they can get locks open.
1113.60s - 1114.80s |  Again, a lot of good talks.
1114.80s - 1116.20s |  Pretty small conference, again.
1116.20s - 1118.20s |  You know, the lock community is a pretty tight-knit group,
1118.20s - 1121.20s |  so maybe about 60, 80 people will show up for this.
1121.20s - 1122.30s |  Just have a really good time.
1122.30s - 1124.90s |  Have some good talks.
1124.90s - 1128.50s |  If you're a little bit more in the Midwest, there's always Locktoberfest in October.
1128.50s - 1131.10s |  It is held by Tool Chicago.
1131.10s - 1132.10s |  Seems like a really good event.
1132.10s - 1135.30s |  I have not been there, but I always see photos, and it looks super fun.
1135.30s - 1138.00s |  So maybe one day I'll make it out there when I can spare the time.
1138.00s - 1139.60s |  But they have, you know, grilling.
1139.60s - 1142.00s |  You can get some beer and some brats and go pick locks.
1142.00s - 1145.40s |  So, you know, proper Locktoberfest.
1145.40s - 1148.30s |  And here's a photo of some people winning some locks and other various picks
1148.30s - 1154.90s |  and cool things from their conference from a couple of years ago.
1154.90s - 1160.10s |  But if you're really into spending your AMLs, head out to Australia.
1160.10s - 1162.50s |  Actually, well, this happened three times now, I think.
1162.50s - 1167.70s |  In Melbourne, there is All Second.
1167.70s - 1171.30s |  It's the same ish as the other events, but it's Australia,
1171.30s - 1174.60s |  so it has a completely different feel to it.
1174.60s - 1175.90s |  Also, a lot of talks.
1175.90s - 1177.30s |  Very interested.
1177.30s - 1181.50s |  Speakers flown in from, well, basically all around the world.
1181.50s - 1186.20s |  But the people there, so the attendants, are mainly Australians.
1186.20s - 1187.50s |  And it's fun. It's brilliant.
1187.50s - 1191.20s |  And, of course, for us international lockpickers, if you go there,
1191.20s - 1196.10s |  they have different locks, and those locks are different beasts,
1196.10s - 1198.10s |  and they need to be attacked in different ways.
1198.10s - 1200.10s |  So that's very fun.
1200.10s - 1204.90s |  That's normally in June, and, well, they have workshops locked and everything.
1205.00s - 1208.80s |  So we did have picking there, master keying.
1208.80s - 1212.00s |  We actually did have an impressioning event at one point,
1212.00s - 1215.50s |  and they're also quite big on temper evidence.
1215.50s - 1221.40s |  So, yeah, that's a very, very, very fun event.
1221.40s - 1227.60s |  Toby, the head organizer, did take a break because of work and life and all the stuff.
1227.60s - 1232.70s |  It'll probably happen again, but probably not this year.
1232.70s - 1234.30s |  Well, definitely not this year.
1234.30s - 1237.40s |  Probably not next year as well, but it's still in the books.
1237.40s - 1240.10s |  At some point that will happen.
1240.10s - 1244.90s |  You see, well, a box of weird keys that they do have there,
1244.90s - 1250.50s |  and some keys are giving a lecture about impressioning.
1250.50s - 1257.60s |  Yeah, and then in Europe, well, like I said, there's lock-on in the Netherlands.
1257.60s - 1265.20s |  The Germans do every now and then also have end impressioning competitions,
1265.20s - 1268.00s |  and on a separate day, they'll do the lock-picking.
1268.00s - 1275.10s |  And the Czech guys at the moment are also doing that.
1275.10s - 1279.80s |  Smaller-ish group, so 90 people, it's rather close to Prague,
1279.80s - 1282.80s |  and that, well, they're doing that for quite a couple of years now.
1282.80s - 1285.40s |  And as you can see, they have a couple of sponsors,
1285.40s - 1288.40s |  which is not always the case within the lock-picking community,
1288.40s - 1289.60s |  at least for an event.
1289.60s - 1295.10s |  Normally, the prizes get sponsored and stuff like that, but that's about it-ish.
1295.10s - 1297.70s |  Is this yours?
1297.70s - 1298.30s |  And where else?
1298.30s - 1301.10s |  There's always a few smaller conferences or conferences that are bigger,
1301.10s - 1303.80s |  but where there's a smaller lock-picking portion to it,
1303.80s - 1306.90s |  of course, DEF CON right through there.
1306.90s - 1309.00s |  It's pretty big here, yeah.
1309.00s - 1310.70s |  There's HOPE in New York.
1310.70s - 1313.90s |  There's ShmooCon in DC, at least one more year.
1313.90s - 1319.40s |  CCC, EMF, all the various Dutch hacker cons that change their name annoyingly every year.
1319.40s - 1321.20s |  For God's reasons.
1321.20s - 1325.40s |  All the various B-sides often have lock-picking events that you can go participate in,
1325.40s - 1329.60s |  and then Hacker Hotel, again in the Netherlands.
1329.60s - 1333.50s |  Other than that, there's also locksmithing and safe technician conferences.
1333.50s - 1335.10s |  These tend to be a little bit more invite-only.
1335.10s - 1338.00s |  You probably need to be part of a locksmithing association.
1338.00s - 1340.00s |  Some of those are easier or harder to join,
1340.00s - 1345.00s |  but you can go and do safe cracking and hear a lot of talks about that if that's your thing,
1345.00s - 1349.60s |  and they have cool prizes like gold-plated locks when you win sponsors.
1349.60s - 1351.40s |  So, that is it.
1351.40s - 1353.20s |  That is all the different kinds of competitions.
1353.20s - 1354.70s |  Those are the different ways you can compete.
1354.70s - 1357.00s |  We wanted to thank a few people.
1357.00s - 1358.20s |  Our co-authors.
1358.20s - 1360.40s |  There were five of us that wrote the book.
1360.40s - 1363.70s |  Three of us are not here, so Walter, Nigel, and Banditos.
1363.70s - 1366.50s |  Really appreciate the sections of the book that they wrote.
1366.50s - 1367.00s |  It was great.
1367.00s - 1370.10s |  I want to thank specifically Peter South, who was our technical reviewer,
1370.10s - 1373.50s |  and who's also here in the front row and has helped out with Tool and Seattle Locksport
1373.50s - 1376.00s |  and co-run Seattle Locksport with me.
1376.00s - 1377.40s |  Super great guy.
1377.40s - 1378.70s |  Lucky Duck, thanks for being here.
1378.70s - 1380.90s |  You're awesome and my favorite.
1380.90s - 1386.40s |  Thanks to Random Person from the Internet for the background photo that was Creative Commons,
1386.40s - 1389.90s |  and then also thanks to Tool US for letting us come here and speak,
1389.90s - 1392.20s |  and to DEF CON for letting us speak.
1392.20s - 1395.30s |  Finally, if you want to get in touch, here are all the things.
1395.30s - 1398.00s |  You can go to links and find me or us.
1398.00s - 1403.30s |  But more importantly, we will be here at the book signing at the NoStarch booth at 2.30 today.
1403.30s - 1405.70s |  So if you do not have a copy of our book and you would like one
1405.70s - 1409.50s |  and you wanted to have at least two author signatures and a tech reviewer signature,
1409.50s - 1413.30s |  2.30, just there, vendor area east.
1413.30s - 1414.80s |  We will be sitting there and signing things.
1414.80s - 1415.70s |  So come say hi.
1415.70s - 1416.90s |  Come get books signed.
1416.90s - 1417.70s |  Thank you so much.
1417.70s - 1418.50s |  One more thing.
1418.50s - 1419.10s |  Yes, yes.
1419.10s - 1421.30s |  One more thing, hot from the press.
1421.30s - 1427.60s |  As of last week, this book also exists in a Braille format.
1427.60s - 1429.50s |  Cool.
1429.50s - 1431.10s |  Yes, very cool.
1431.10s - 1436.80s |  That is currently only in Europe because it has been transcribed there to make that happen.
1436.80s - 1441.80s |  But as I understood, I am completely new to this format and this world.
1441.80s - 1446.00s |  I do have a couple of blind friends, but of course, I don't do Braille.
1446.00s - 1451.40s |  Apparently, the way it works, if it does exist in Europe,
1451.40s - 1454.20s |  then it automagically will, at some point,
1454.20s - 1459.60s |  will become available in American Braille libraries as well.
1459.60s - 1465.22s |  So we think it's awesome.
1465.22s - 1466.32s |  Thank you, DEF CON.
1466.32s - 1467.32s |  Thank you.
