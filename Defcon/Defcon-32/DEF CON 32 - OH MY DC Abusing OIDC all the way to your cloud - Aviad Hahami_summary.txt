**Overview of OIDC and CI/CD**

- **OIDC**: OpenID Connect, an **OAuth** extension for authentication.
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment, involves automated workflows for code updates.
- **Entities in CI/CD**: Developer, **VCS provider** (e.g., GitHub), **CI provider**, and cloud environments.
  
**OIDC in CI/CD Context**

- **Authentication Challenge**: Machine-to-machine authentication without hardcoding credentials.
- **OIDC Flow**:
  - Request ID token
  - Use token to access cloud resources
  - Cloud verifies token integrity and policies

**OIDC Tokens and Claims**

- **ID Tokens**: Short-lived, based on identity, contain claims.
- **Claims**: Key-value pairs in token body, e.g., **subject (sub)**, **audience (aud)**.
- **Custom Claims**: Provided by CI vendors, vary by platform (e.g., GitHub, CircleCI).

**Misconfigurations and Vulnerabilities**

- **No-configs**: Lax rules in identity federation, allowing broad access.
- **Partial Configs**: Unsafe if not specific enough, e.g., **repo:** or **org name** patterns.
- **Workflow Claim Risks**: Claims based on user input can be manipulated.

**Common Pitfalls in Configuration**

- **Custom Claims Format**: Critical order and content of claims.
- **Pattern Matching**: Wildcards can lead to vulnerabilities.
- **Misconfigured Identity Providers**: Can expose resources.

**Exploitation Techniques**

- **Poison Pipeline Execution (PPE)**: Exploiting CI workflows via pull requests.
- **Spray Tokens**: Finding lax policies by testing multiple tokens.

**Case Study: CircleCI Misconfiguration**

- **Vulnerability**: ID tokens granted to all machines, including forks.
- **Impact**: Access to OIDC protected resources across organizations.
- **Resolution**: CircleCI updated policies to require opt-in for fork pull requests.

**Best Practices**

- **Learn Claim Origins**: Understand where claims come from and their strength.
- **Avoid Wildcards**: Use specific policies to limit access.
- **Harden Pipelines**: Follow security best practices to protect CI/CD workflows.

**Conclusion**

- **Understanding OIDC**: Simplifies securing machine-to-machine communication.
- **Security Awareness**: Essential in configuring identity and access management.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update and review security practices.
