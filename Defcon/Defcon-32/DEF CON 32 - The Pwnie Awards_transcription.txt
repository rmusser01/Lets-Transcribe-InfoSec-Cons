 Hello. Welcome to the 2024 Pony Awards. I'm so happy to see all of you. And I'm so happy
12.51s - 21.83s |  none of you had to spend $5,000 to get in this time. So, oh yeah, sorry we have an intro
21.83s - 41.38s |  reel I forgot. Good morning everyone. Welcome to the 2024 Pony Awards ceremony. Today we
41.38s - 48.30s |  celebrate this year's outstanding achievements in security. And some, well, not so outstanding
48.30s - 54.74s |  ones, all for the first time ever at DEF CON. We hope you enjoy the show. Without further
54.74s - 70.74s |  ado, please welcome your host, Ian Roos. You can tell we didn't do a dry run. It'll be
70.74s - 76.58s |  good though. Uh, yeah. So, thank you so much for coming. I'm so happy to see you all here.
76.58s - 80.74s |  Uh, we do like maybe a rough show of hands. How many of you are already familiar with
80.74s - 84.66s |  the Pony Awards? Alright, I should do that backwards. How many of you have never seen
84.66s - 91.82s |  the Pony Awards? It's like the same people. Um, okay. So, the Pony Awards are a annual
91.82s - 98.34s |  award show for security research where we try to celebrate both the successes and failures
98.34s - 107.22s |  of the security community. Uh, the, the general kind of gist of it is, you know, we have some
107.22s - 112.38s |  very good awards. We have some maybe not so good awards, but people tend to kind of
112.38s - 120.62s |  appreciate it, roll with it, have fun. Um, the, as a heads up, uh, as we give out the
120.62s - 127.06s |  awards today, um, there will very hopefully be people in the crowd who are available to
127.06s - 134.10s |  accept the award. If that happens, please come up on stage. We'll give you a horse and
134.10s - 139.22s |  then you can take a couple of minutes in order to, uh, talk about, uh, the research that
139.22s - 144.54s |  you did. Now, something we've run into in the past is not everybody can make it out
144.54s - 150.14s |  despite our best efforts. Uh, we are a purely volunteer effort and, uh, do not make any
150.14s - 155.78s |  money so we're not flying people out for this yet, but we'd love to get there one day. Um,
155.78s - 162.22s |  in the event that, uh, the winner is not available, I would love for someone who is maybe
162.22s - 166.78s |  familiar with the body of research or the work that they did to come up on stage and
166.78s - 172.22s |  give, you know, a couple minutes, kind of explain what it is, why it's important. Uh, if
172.22s - 177.46s |  you feel like maybe you deserve the pony instead, I'm not gonna tell you what to do, but,
177.46s - 184.74s |  um, you can fight over it. Uh, and then, um, yeah, that's sort of the plan. Does that sound
184.82s - 198.92s |  good? All right, right on. So, for our first award, I would, uh, like to invite, uh, the
198.92s - 210.68s |  ransomware actor, Elf, on stage.
210.68s - 219.48s |  Hello. I am Elf, also known as Black Hat Ransomware Group. I'm your typical, uh,
219.48s - 229.34s |  ransomware as a service animal. Hey. I know there's been lots of speculation as to how
229.34s - 234.38s |  they've let me stateside, but do you think you would get far if you had a six-foot-tall
234.38s - 241.46s |  Russian handler? Speaking of the cat getting out of the bag, I ran into the president of
241.46s - 247.74s |  CrowdStrike backstage. Hey, listen, Mike is a great guy. Huge fan of his work, really.
247.74s - 251.78s |  They're true artists over there at CrowdStrike. Truly humbling to see a big tech company
251.78s - 257.50s |  putting art and memes first. Let's just say, if I got my paws on 8 million devices and
257.54s - 262.62s |  execution in kernel, I would make enough ransomware money to maybe afford a CrowdStrike
262.62s - 269.30s |  subscription. I'm here to present the award for best cryptographic bug. Folks, as a
269.30s - 273.94s |  ransomware operator, encryption is near and dear to my heart, and we got some great
273.94s - 279.02s |  research here. Neural network-aided cryptanalysis, Apple processor, side channel
279.02s - 285.14s |  attacks, and, hey, UPnP. For those who have ever looked at UPnP's security stack, we
285.14s - 293.78s |  have an old saying. I pee, you pee, we all pee on UPnP. Well, folks, I got to snort some
293.78s - 300.22s |  catnip and I got to snort some catnip with some cyber insurance dollars, so let's hear it
300.22s - 306.18s |  for these nominees. What?
308.42s - 315.22s |  First up, presenting the nominees for best crypto bug. Breach extraction attacks by
315.22s - 320.62s |  Corneropolis, leveraging leakage from cryptographic protocols and compromised credential
320.62s - 325.98s |  checking services, specifically Cloudflare's implementation to reconstruct encrypted
325.98s - 333.46s |  passwords on servers using cryptographic insights and neural networks. GoFetch, breaking
333.46s - 339.70s |  constant-time cryptographic implementations using data-memory dependent prefetchers by
339.70s - 345.70s |  Boruchan, a micro-architectural side channel attack that exploits data-memory dependent
345.70s - 351.26s |  prefetchers on Apple processors to extract secret keys from constant-time cryptographic
351.26s - 359.62s |  implementations. Blast Radius, RADIUS UDP, considered harmful by Nadia. This significant
359.62s - 365.38s |  attack targets a major protocol using a powerful, underused vector that exploits the legacy
365.38s - 381.46s |  use of MD5, which lacks chosen prefix collision resistance. And the pony goes to, it's hard
381.46s - 392.46s |  with pause, Boruchan for GoFetch, breaking constant-time cryptographic implementations using
392.46s - 408.25s |  data-memory dependent prefetchers. Congratulations. Boruchan, are you here? All right.
417.25s - 425.65s |  It's on now. Okay. So first dry run. You ready? Is anyone here familiar with this work? Come on.
425.65s - 431.41s |  No crypto. No crypto people in the crowd. I understand. It's really difficult. It's all weird
431.41s - 438.53s |  math and shit. You sure? All right. Well, I encourage you. Hi. Maybe they need to study math
438.53s - 445.65s |  at Deep State University. I would encourage all of you to look up this research. We'll be
445.65s - 451.57s |  publishing links to the papers that they're writing, blog posts, all of that, online, probably
451.57s - 457.09s |  in a couple days when I've actually slept. And, yeah. With that, I think we'll move on to the
457.09s - 471.99s |  next presenter. All righty. For the presenter for best desktop bug, I'd like to invite Mark
472.15s - 487.64s |  Trumpor on stage. Good evening. Well, it's evening somewhere. And it's Vegas, so there's no clocks.
489.16s - 492.92s |  So, yeah. Evening. Maybe next year we can do this later in the day.
494.84s - 499.24s |  Your dinner jacket is excellent. Thank you. Thank you. I can't believe you can see it.
501.96s - 507.08s |  I'm Mark Trumpor. I'm the executive director of SummerCon, America's oldest hacker conference,
507.08s - 517.54s |  which has been running continuously since 1987. It is our honor to host the Pony Award
517.54s - 526.04s |  nominations, and it is my pleasure to introduce the contenders for best desktop bug. In a world
526.04s - 531.96s |  where general purpose computing happens everywhere, from the cloud to the door of your refrigerator,
531.96s - 539.88s |  desktop bug might sound a bit anachronistic. But as recent events have shown, from airline
539.88s - 547.16s |  check-in kiosks to the blue sphere of death, okay, maybe the sphere pictures were a hoax,
547.16s - 554.60s |  but they were still funny. Um, desktop systems are everywhere, proving that this category is as
554.60s - 563.32s |  relevant as ever. Let's take a look at this year's nominees. Here are the nominees for best desktop
563.32s - 571.05s |  bug. Ben Barnea's three episode research on Windows Paths by Nachos Kernel. Highlighting
571.05s - 576.89s |  the complexity of parsing Windows Paths, leading to severe consequences like zero-click vulnerabilities
576.89s - 584.49s |  in Outlook or Windows Explorer. A Chrome zero day caused by improperly triggered audio rendering
584.49s - 592.09s |  by 708v1. A long-standing bug in Chrome allows forced real-time audio rendering without user
592.09s - 600.09s |  interaction, exploited in last year's Tianfu Cup. Byte code breakdown. Unraveling Factorio's Lua
600.09s - 605.77s |  security flaws by Daniels B. Exploiting a vulnerability in the Lua implementation of
605.77s - 613.29s |  Factorio. Enabling a malicious server to execute arbitrary code on clients, affecting every player.
613.29s - 628.87s |  And the pony for best desktop bug goes to 708v1 for a Chrome O day caused by improperly triggered
629.11s - 638.23s |  audio rendering. Congratulations. All right. I'm going to start just pulling people up at some
638.23s - 647.19s |  point. Is anyone familiar with this body of work? Okay. I have used Chrome. Here's what we're going
647.19s - 654.79s |  to do. Has anyone done any interesting desktop exploitation Chrome bug research recently?
654.87s - 660.07s |  Anyone maybe pitch your work very briefly? I know you're out there. It's fine. You can come
660.07s - 667.27s |  up. I'll call someone out. Just pick somebody at random. Make them describe some. They're all
667.27s - 673.67s |  very nervous. I know. We were actually thinking about dropping this category at a certain point
673.67s - 680.79s |  because no one uses desktops anymore. It's all in the cloud. It's all desktops. It's smart. It's
680.79s - 690.07s |  very clearly laptops. All right. Well, with that, let's move on to our next category. I know some
690.07s - 700.38s |  of you are here, by the way. Okay. For our next category, we have the best mobile bug research of
700.38s - 718.92s |  the year presented by Kai. So, hello. I am very excited to be here primarily because I have
718.92s - 724.04s |  another reason to wear this really expensive jacket that I have only had one opportunity to
724.04s - 729.64s |  wear before. Uh, I thought the tombstone logs in the back of it would be a little too niche, so
729.64s - 734.88s |  bear with me on this. Uh, the state of mobile security has been, I think, steadily improving,
734.88s - 739.08s |  and that's kind of commensurate by some of the best researchers fucking off to go audit Ethereum
739.08s - 746.60s |  smart contracts or something. Um, but I am really happy to be here and I want to give you guys a
746.60s - 752.44s |  little bit of advice. Uh, for any aspiring mobile security researchers out there, pay attention in
752.44s - 758.16s |  your complexity theory class. Building Turing machines is no longer just an academic exercise.
758.16s - 764.92s |  I also want to say, pay attention- I also want to say, pay attention in your undocumented
764.92s - 771.50s |  hardware feature class. You'll never know when you'll need a PPL bypass. Uh, and with that, uh,
771.50s - 776.90s |  my only real move in these situations is, I have students and generally I have power over them and
776.90s - 781.78s |  threaten to fail them if they don't laugh, so I will fail you if you don't laugh. And the nominees
781.78s - 786.78s |  are- right a button? Here are the nominees for best mobile bug. Operation Triangulation by, who
792.46s - 798.72s |  knows, one of the most sophisticated attacks targeting iPhones, notable for being the first to
798.72s - 806.92s |  exploit a hardware feature in iPhones. Gaining kernel code execution on an MTE-enabled Pixel 8 by
806.92s - 813.50s |  Manwei Mo, exploiting a vulnerability in the ARM Mealy GPU to achieve arbitrary kernel code
813.50s - 821.00s |  execution and gain root access on an Android phone, even with MTE mitigation enabled. That
821.06s - 829.06s |  Samsung Galaxy A bug chain by MaxRB. Triggered via USB, allowing code execution in the boot
829.06s - 835.20s |  loader, control over Android, and leakage of secrets stored in trust zone, affecting many
835.20s - 847.80s |  devices in the Galaxy A family. And the winner is- Operation Triangulation. Operation
851.42s - 858.06s |  Triangulation, are you out there? I- Anyone want to take credit for this? I would be so happy. Oh
858.08s - 864.12s |  my gosh, they're here. Operation Triangulation is in the room. Please. Yeah? Please come up on
864.12s - 869.50s |  stage. Hi. Would you like to say a few words? I'm just- I'm just here to- I'm not going to take
869.50s - 874.26s |  credit. Um, I think it's pretty cool, this category, because it's mobile, and mobile still has
874.26s - 878.50s |  lots of hardware crap put together in it, and this is kind of a great example of it, because
878.50s - 884.68s |  you've got a core that someone makes and has debug features, and they forget to turn them off.
884.68s - 888.10s |  It's awesome. It happens all the time. If you're not into hardware, check it out, because
888.10s - 894.24s |  there's a lot of wide open doors all over everything in hardware. And if we agree that this
894.24s - 898.52s |  pony has zero value, there is a possibility I could at least get it back to the folks who
898.52s - 902.98s |  discovered and reported it. Because, you know, no sanction violations if I bring something of
902.98s - 906.82s |  zero value. I mean, there's no money attached to this, so I don't know. Winona, is this
906.82s - 912.82s |  illegal? Sorry. This is a pony? It is a pony. It's a gummy bear. You can eat it. Is it clean? I
921.72s - 927.36s |  wouldn't ask. Okay. Well, yeah. Hack on hardware. Hardware is awesome. I'll do my best to see
927.36s - 934.26s |  if I can get this to someone who knows. Either side. I don't give a shit. Either end of it. Up
934.28s - 938.52s |  to you, man. Well, no, not triangulation folks. The Kaspersky votes who found it. But, you
938.52s - 941.16s |  know, they didn't really want the first ones to find it. They were just the ones who saw someone
941.16s - 945.12s |  else who found it. I think they're in another category coming up, too. Oh, they are? I'm pretty
945.12s - 954.93s |  happy. I'll stay close to the front. You should give it to them. Thank you. All right. Now
966.02s - 978.46s |  introducing our presenter for the best song category, Claudia. Thank you, everyone. I get very
978.48s - 984.58s |  excited about this. And also, isn't Ian doing a great job? He is crushing it. It's not easy when
984.58s - 988.86s |  you don't really know who's going to be in the audience and, uh, you know, there's a lot of
988.86s - 994.86s |  mystery on both sides here. So you might be asking yourself, best song in the ponies award? Why?
999.20s - 1006.40s |  The answer is vibes. I think all of us can agree that working in security, you need to generate
1006.44s - 1013.36s |  the right vibes to get to the right goal. You know, when we're running CTFs, you need to have
1013.36s - 1020.36s |  some epic gamer music. Shout out to EDM for powering us through many a late night coding
1021.00s - 1034.28s |  sesh. So today it is my honor to talk about who might in the last year have generated those rare
1034.64s - 1040.64s |  vibes that we needed in moments of difficulty. So without further ado, the nominees for best song
1045.44s - 1051.44s |  are the nominees for best song 2024 touch some grass by UWU underground. Kids out here believing
1054.92s - 1060.92s |  what they're told. The X on the ground, code snail loads by Lava Dose. It's falling back. It's
1064.52s - 1070.52s |  right through them. That works too. And the pony for best song goes to UWU for touch some grass.
1093.08s - 1100.08s |  Let's go. A good reminder for us all. Do we have someone? Yes. I think we have someone to
1100.08s - 1107.33s |  accept the award. I mean, who wouldn't want to take credit for this, you know? Nice. Awesome.
1109.33s - 1114.83s |  Hi, my name is Int 80. I'm the rapper in a group called dual core and also in a group called the
1114.83s - 1120.83s |  troubleshooters and also in a group called no friends and I am not magical malware girls. However,
1123.37s - 1129.37s |  we do have a collaboration in the mix and I have been nominated by UWU underground to accept this
1129.37s - 1135.37s |  award on their behalf. I will say I get asked a lot as a rapper, what do you think about AI
1138.13s - 1144.03s |  generated music? And as a rapper, I do not consider myself a real musician because rapping does not
1144.03s - 1150.03s |  require talent. And I actually genuinely love the music that UWU underground makes and so that is
1151.25s - 1156.07s |  why I reached out to them to collaborate. So I'm very excited that they have won this award.
1156.11s - 1162.11s |  Jonathan Scott can eat my butt from the front. Man wipes his phone and calls it a POC. Hack all the
1164.85s - 1170.85s |  things, touch some grass and get off the screen. Speaking of mobile researchers, damn. Thank you so
1172.77s - 1178.77s |  much. Would you like to select? Yes. Oh, no. It's dealer's choice. Okay. And I will somehow, I
1179.77s - 1186.23s |  don't know the identity of UWU underground but I will ship internationally if needed. This speaks
1186.23s - 1198.28s |  UWU underground to me. Touch grass. Very good point. Thank you so much. All right, wonderful.
1201.25s - 1207.25s |  Next up, we have the pony for most innovative research being presented by Ryan Spears. Welcome
1209.33s - 1219.99s |  to the stage. Good morning everyone. This category is pretty fun to see. When we go through the
1219.99s - 1226.69s |  nominations for these and basically take away your democratic process behind the scenes, we get to
1226.69s - 1233.99s |  see some truly innovative ideas as well as, I guess I wasn't supposed to say that part. Some truly
1233.99s - 1239.99s |  innovative ideas. We talked about this. And those ideas that were already done 20 years ago and you
1241.57s - 1248.37s |  all are self-nominating and claiming they're still innovative. That's true. There were some in
1248.37s - 1253.03s |  this category of exploiting IP facing protocols and that's not innovative but some of the
1253.03s - 1260.25s |  approaches this year truly were. We had a long section of DNS bugs uh that somebody had fun I
1260.25s - 1266.45s |  think making 30 plus CVEs so good scoring for yourself. There were other attacks against
1266.45s - 1272.07s |  security infrastructure and the new features. Which is good. It shows the circle of life in this
1272.07s - 1278.49s |  community. Right? Some of you worked hard all of last year since the last ponies to help add
1278.49s - 1285.35s |  attack surface in the name of security features. And that's important because otherwise I'd be
1285.35s - 1291.31s |  worried about the future of this category. But thanks to your hard work, we continue to have new
1291.31s - 1298.19s |  innovative attack surface and so let's see this year's nominations. Here are the nominees for most
1298.19s - 1307.07s |  innovative research. Ahoy Attacks by Benedict Schluter. Introducing a novel method of injecting
1307.07s - 1313.33s |  virtual interrupts into confidential VMs, CVMs, to alter their execution state and break
1313.33s - 1319.25s |  confidentiality. Two-door attack. Systematically exploring and exploiting logic,
1319.29s - 1324.87s |  vulnerabilities, and DNS response. Pre-processing with malformed packets by IDEALEAR.
1325.67s - 1331.03s |  Exploiting DNS response pre-processing vulnerabilities to perform DNS cache poisoning within
1331.03s - 1338.67s |  one second. Leading to the assignment of 33 CVE IDs. Let the cache cache and let the web assembly
1338.67s - 1345.79s |  assemble. Knocking on Chrome's shell by Eduard Bochin and Tao Yan. Successfully demonstrated a
1345.79s - 1353.71s |  novel V8 sandbox escape technique at Pwn2Own Vancouver 2024. Setting a new precedent in V8
1353.71s - 1366.76s |  exploitation. So let's see. And the pony goes to, for most innovative research, Edward and Tao for
1366.76s - 1375.26s |  let the cache cache and let the web assembly assemble. Knocking on Chrome's shell. I think
1375.26s - 1380.34s |  someone stood up back there. Are you going to the bathroom? Are you coming up? Oh shoot, they're
1380.34s - 1389.65s |  here. This is so exciting. Congrats, come on.
1389.65s - 1396.55s |  Thank you so much. You can, you can give a talk.
1396.55s - 1404.57s |  I wouldn't want to come on.
1409.57s - 1418.21s |  Hey, hi everyone. Um, so yeah, basically, uh, uh, our research is based on, uh, the release of a new
1418.21s - 1424.61s |  sandbox for the V8 JavaScript engine. Uh, that was, uh, the beta release was actually, uh,
1424.61s - 1436.17s |  released in March of this year. So, uh, we needed to actually bypass it for Pwn2Own and, um, uh, so
1436.17s - 1441.61s |  new features were involved and we need to actually find new ways to bypass that sandbox. That's
1441.61s - 1447.81s |  what we did at Pwn2Own. We did a talk to Black Hat, uh, a couple of days ago. Uh, the slides are
1447.81s - 1453.65s |  available on the Black Hat website and, uh, the video will be available also soon, I guess. So,
1453.65s - 1455.65s |  uh, just check it out and yeah, thanks.
1455.65s - 1463.28s |  Thank you.
1463.28s - 1476.25s |  Thank you so much. Oh, I'm next. How about that? Oh, this is a fun one. I'm really excited for
1476.25s - 1483.66s |  this one. You guys don't even know what's about to happen. Next up, we have the Pony Award for
1483.66s - 1491.86s |  Most Epic Fail. Now we kind of snitched on ourselves because I really couldn't help myself.
1491.86s - 1498.50s |  Um, the, the, if you're following on Twitter, you know who the winner is already. Uh, that ended
1498.50s - 1504.34s |  up happening because, uh, normally we present the nominees, as Mark said earlier, at SummerCon and
1504.34s - 1510.58s |  this happened like a day beforehand. And so we kind of just ended up scrapping all the nominees
1510.58s - 1515.70s |  and, uh, made an executive decision, uh, when you knock off like every airline.
1515.86s - 1522.10s |  And now here are the nominees for Most Epic Fail.
1523.22s - 1539.97s |  LOL. Today's adversaries move fast. CrowdStrike moves fast. CrowdStrike, we stop breaches.
1540.93s - 1552.11s |  Wow, you're a winner. How about that? Well, do we have anyone here who would like to accept this
1552.11s - 1567.06s |  Pony Award? Oh my goodness gracious. We do. Uh, which, uh, I don't know if these, yeah, I think
1567.06s - 1579.50s |  these are too small. I think we need another, I think we might need a different award. Look at
1579.50s - 1589.39s |  that. I can open the envelope if we need to, but it's all yours. Can I put it down there? Yeah.
1589.47s - 1596.13s |  That's a big trophy. Uh, hey everyone, Mike Santonis, president of CrowdStrike.
1602.13s - 1607.25s |  Definitely, uh, not the award to be proud of receiving, but, uh, I think the team was
1607.25s - 1611.65s |  surprised when I said straight away that I would come and get it because we got this horribly wrong.
1611.65s - 1616.85s |  We've said that a number of different times and it's, uh, super important to own it when you do
1616.85s - 1620.53s |  things well. It's super important to own it when you do things, uh, horribly wrong, which we did in
1620.53s - 1626.45s |  this case. Uh, the reason why I wanted the trophy is I'm heading back to headquarters. Uh, I'm going
1626.45s - 1630.93s |  to take the trophy with me. It's going to sit pride of place because I want every CrowdStriker
1630.93s - 1636.85s |  who comes to work to see it because, you know, our goal is to protect people and, uh, we got this
1636.85s - 1639.97s |  wrong and I want to make sure that everybody understands these things can't happen and that's
1639.97s - 1644.13s |  what this community is about. So from that perspective, I will say thank you and I will
1644.13s - 1649.25s |  take the trophy and we'll put it in the right place and, uh, make sure everybody sees it. So
1649.25s - 1664.69s |  thank you. See, people are mad at us for giving out like negative awards, but then you get people
1664.69s - 1672.77s |  like really, you know, taking it and speaking to it. It's good. I'm very happy. Um, all right, let's
1672.77s - 1678.85s |  keep moving along. Next up, we have the pony for most underhyped research being presented by
1678.85s - 1686.37s |  Ong Kwee, the CEO of RedBlue Insecurity and one of our sponsors. All right, all right. I am Ong
1686.37s - 1694.05s |  and, um, this is the award for the best research, right? No, it's the most underrated research. Um,
1694.05s - 1700.61s |  as a recipient of, of this years and years ago, I have some things to say, but in the audience,
1700.61s - 1707.62s |  show of hands, has anyone else received this award in the past? Nope. We all work at Wendy's. We got
1707.62s - 1713.54s |  jobs, you losers. All right. Um, so some of the things that I want to, you know, for example, I
1713.54s - 1717.94s |  want to give examples of really innovative, impactful things that have changed our lives
1718.50s - 1724.82s |  that most of us don't even care or know about. So I was reading this paper that is also very
1724.82s - 1731.94s |  underrated. It's the breeding behavior of blind Mexican cave fish, uh, in river dwelling cavities
1731.94s - 1737.06s |  of, of types, right? That's important. That's literally going to change the world and stuff.
1737.06s - 1743.46s |  Um, some other examples, Gregor Mandel, right? He like made peas, you know, do their business,
1743.46s - 1750.58s |  uh, and created the theory behind genetics and hybridization. Awesome, important work. Uh, people
1750.58s - 1756.90s |  gave him a high five for that 16 years after he died. So, you know, there's always something to
1756.90s - 1762.18s |  look forward to. And then, uh, you know, not all, well, also the plate tectonics, right? Remember
1762.18s - 1768.90s |  for the thousands of years, uh, 2000, a thousand people thought the world was always the way it is,
1768.90s - 1772.74s |  even though, you know, even any five-year-old can look at like all the continents and say, like,
1772.74s - 1778.26s |  if I squish them together, don't they all kind of fit? Right. So yeah, that was the paper that
1778.26s - 1788.58s |  was written. Let me check in, uh, in 1596. And it was officially accepted in 1959 that plates move
1788.58s - 1795.14s |  and the round thing, you know, they shift and there used to be Pangea, right? So, uh, last example,
1795.14s - 1802.58s |  um, the wonderful man, very, very, very underrated, uh, Thomas Midgley, Midgley. Does anybody know who
1802.58s - 1809.14s |  Thomas Midgley is? Show of hands. All right. Underrated indeed. This is a man in one decade
1809.14s - 1816.26s |  invented leaded gasoline and chlorofluorocarbons, right? To make the world kick ass. So, you know,
1816.26s - 1823.22s |  he's pretty underrated too, right? So in that context, um, let's look at some of the most
1823.22s - 1833.20s |  underrated research of this year. And finally, the nominees for most underhyped research.
1833.36s - 1840.16s |  See no eval. Runtime dynamic code execution in Objective-C by CodeColorist. Highlighting

1898.09s - 1904.70s |  Runtime dynamic code execution. Objective C. Anybody? Uh,
1904.74s - 1908.78s |  anybody here? Anybody here? Uh, bathroom?
1909.02s - 1912.06s |  He's going to the bathroom. Yes. Yes. Oh my gosh. Let's go.
1914.41s - 1915.45s |  What are you forgetting?
1917.01s - 1919.25s |  No running at the pool, sir. Picture. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1929.11s - 1930.95s |  you want to grab a pony. Yeah. Talk, talk, talk, go, go.
1931.43s - 1934.99s |  Actually I'm taking it. I'm a friend of my behave. Yeah.

1955.15s - 1973.10s |  Yeah. He also says, thanks mom. Thank you. All right. Thank you so much.
1973.34s - 1976.38s |  That's another thing. Like I love it when like, you know,
1976.50s - 1978.30s |  except on a friend's behalf, you know,
1979.06s - 1983.50s |  make it so we don't have to mail a horse. Fun fact, um,
1983.54s - 1987.34s |  designing these things. So, uh, these were all manufactured,

2001.86s - 2004.34s |  Have you ever had to buy 11 my little ponies off Amazon?
2005.42s - 2009.58s |  Do you know what that does to your ad targeting? I do.
2009.94s - 2014.58s |  It's not great. Um, uh, and then the, the best part was, uh,
2014.62s - 2016.78s |  I taking all of them and shoving 11,
2016.78s - 2020.42s |  my little ponies into a backpack and then taking the train down cause I really
2020.42s - 2023.38s |  didn't want to explain it to a TSA agent. Uh,
2023.78s - 2027.54s |  but you get a really weird thrill just thinking like nobody on this train knows I
2027.54s - 2032.34s |  have 11 my little pony horses in my backpack right now up until
2032.82s - 2036.58s |  they were buying podiums for it and demanded that I open it up and pull one out
2036.58s - 2040.82s |  and start measuring it on the train, which I had to do. So thanks guys.
2042.06s - 2044.50s |  All right. Um, moving right along.
2044.50s - 2047.94s |  We have the pony for best privilege escalation being presented by Nika.
2057.00s - 2057.84s |  Hi Defcon.
2058.84s - 2060.40s |  Standing here today,
2060.48s - 2064.24s |  I feel very privileged to present this category,
2064.92s - 2068.24s |  but it's this category that takes that to a new level,
2068.56s - 2070.88s |  a level we're told we're not allowed to reach,
2071.52s - 2076.36s |  but rules are for suckers and this year's nominees are rule breakers.
2077.76s - 2080.68s |  Privilege escalation. There we go.
2081.48s - 2085.60s |  Privilege escalation is an exploitation technique that is used to gain access to
2085.60s - 2089.28s |  resources or functionality. A user should be restricted from accessing.
2090.04s - 2093.88s |  It's like when you make friends with the bouncer and cut the line at Burkheim.
2095.36s - 2096.20s |  Yeah.
2097.28s - 2102.28s |  The bouncer is the trust boundary and you and your crew look at each other and go
2103.12s - 2104.56s |  low. We're going in anyway.
2106.24s - 2110.88s |  It's about saying fuck you and showing that your ex boy is sicker than whatever
2110.88s - 2112.96s |  code the devs push to prod.
2113.08s - 2113.92s |  Yeah.
2114.64s - 2118.52s |  Privilege escalation is about breaking into spaces where the doors are locked.
2118.72s - 2123.04s |  The glass ceiling feels stratospherically high and the guards are ruthless.
2124.12s - 2126.92s |  In the Olympics, people always want to reach the next level,
2127.52s - 2129.52s |  earn the privilege of a gold medal.
2130.32s - 2133.04s |  Here we have people who can cheat the best,
2133.36s - 2135.60s |  whisper the best incantations,
2136.00s - 2137.48s |  cast the best spells.
2138.36s - 2142.72s |  This category is for those who put in the best effort to slide the scale in
2142.76s - 2147.76s |  their favor for best privilege escalation for staying lifted by any means
2148.16s - 2150.44s |  possible. Scored on style.
2151.88s - 2156.40s |  I'm going to defer to the artist known as D noise for some spiritually
2156.40s - 2159.96s |  enlightening verse on the hollow topic of per desk.
2163.80s - 2165.76s |  When I'm told I'm offensive,
2166.16s - 2170.72s |  I need to check my privilege and T authority system.
2171.68s - 2174.12s |  Here are the nominees for best progress.
2174.88s - 2184.61s |  And now the nominees for best privilege escalation,
2185.33s - 2192.31s |  unplugging XHCI and enabling step on the road to VMware VM
2192.31s - 2197.31s |  escape by Victor V detailing a successful VMware workstation escape exploit
2198.55s - 2203.55s |  from the TN for cup 2023 by removing the XHCI USB controller within the virtual
2205.03s - 2208.39s |  machine, triggering a use after free vulnerability.
2209.79s - 2213.11s |  A registry window to kernel memory by M jerk sick,

2241.23s - 2242.07s |  competition.
2246.14s - 2257.30s |  And the pony goes to chompy for windows streaming service.
2275.78s - 2278.10s |  Okay. I don't have anything prepared. Uh,
2279.22s - 2282.34s |  didn't even know if I was going to come. I, uh,
2282.98s - 2286.78s |  I don't know who decided to make this at 10am on Saturday after Defcon,
2286.78s - 2290.74s |  but I'm here a little underdressed. Everyone looks amazing. Um,
2291.10s - 2295.66s |  don't have that much to say other than I'm super grateful for my, uh,
2295.70s - 2300.22s |  management and my team that support me and allowing me to do public research.
2300.26s - 2303.54s |  I know that's not a common thing. So I get to share, uh,
2303.54s - 2308.54s |  all my work publicly and a shout out to the other people that were nominated.
2308.82s - 2313.02s |  Victor V and drew were legends, uh, stiff competition.
2313.34s - 2317.86s |  And also to, uh, my husband that puts up with me when I don't,
2317.94s - 2320.14s |  on the days I don't find bugs. So.
2320.74s - 2321.58s |  Thank you.
2338.31s - 2342.83s |  Thank you so much. Chompy. Um, all right.
2342.99s - 2344.95s |  I could tell there was a crowd favorite out there too.
2345.07s - 2349.55s |  Like you guys kind of lay your souls away. Um, let's see.
2349.55s - 2354.27s |  Next up we have the pony award for best remote code execution being presented by
2354.27s - 2355.11s |  Ryan again.
2361.74s - 2367.99s |  I'm so glad this is still a category as well. And I'm told I can't say much.
2368.03s - 2373.03s |  So there's all types of RC and there were a lot of logic and web app bypasses
2373.63s - 2378.39s |  this year. And a lot of people asked me, do those count yet? Yes.
2378.39s - 2381.91s |  They're remotes. That's fine. But we also, um,
2381.95s - 2385.67s |  all too often talk about web drive buys and zero and one clicks.
2385.67s - 2390.47s |  And this year we had a lot of nominations that luckily took advantage of things
2390.47s - 2394.47s |  like exchange and just parked it in your inbox and let the computer click it over
2394.47s - 2396.31s |  and over and over for you.
2397.87s - 2402.51s |  And then we of course had nominations of the classic patterns and everyone made
2402.51s - 2403.95s |  sure this year, again,
2403.95s - 2408.95s |  thank you to the community for leaving in buffer overflows use after freeze.
2409.67s - 2414.11s |  We and the nominees appreciate your dedication to these patterns.
2415.31s - 2417.87s |  Otherwise this could get boring or more interesting.
2418.31s - 2419.91s |  So now let's see for the nominees.
2421.59s - 2425.71s |  Next up here are the nominees for best remote code execution.
2428.30s - 2433.18s |  Jump server pre-auth RCE exploit full chain by Lolliot and Jin Yang Peng.

2450.66s - 2455.66s |  This Microsoft exchange RCE chain consists of three vulnerabilities enabling
2455.86s - 2457.98s |  RCE by any domain user.
2458.78s - 2463.78s |  The overlooked pattern path to pre-auth RCE by root OX Koshell a critical
2464.90s - 2469.26s |  pre-authenticated remote code execution vulnerability affecting all windows
2469.26s - 2474.26s |  versions from server 2008 to server 2022 and windows 10 and 11.
2479.41s - 2483.93s |  So the pony for best remote code execution goes to,
2483.93s - 2488.93s |  let's see root OX Koshell for the overlooked pattern CVE 2024 380 path to
2491.73s - 2493.21s |  pre-auth RCE.
2499.98s - 2503.66s |  I stopped using it. Are we back now? Okay. I stopped using it so I don't blame them.
2503.70s - 2506.82s |  Um, the, are you here? No,
2506.86s - 2509.54s |  that's maybe good because we're running short on time. All right,
2509.54s - 2517.18s |  let's move right along. We'll send it over to them. All right.
2517.18s - 2520.74s |  Next up for the lamest vendor response, we have Winona.
2524.89s - 2527.17s |  Hey, what's up guys? Um, my name is Winona.
2527.17s - 2531.45s |  I'm a former reverse engineer now in law school, but I am not anyone's lawyer yet.
2531.93s - 2536.93s |  Um, don't, don't tell me all the shit you do Ian. Um, so first off, um,
2537.25s - 2540.57s |  I have the distinct pleasure of introducing the lamest vendor response.
2540.77s - 2543.33s |  Although I do want to say thank you guys all for coming.
2543.53s - 2545.53s |  Like the hacker community is so wonderful.
2545.53s - 2549.69s |  Like who else is going to come all the way out to the devil's armpit of America
2550.01s - 2554.77s |  and go party all night and then show up at 10 AM for an award show with people
2554.77s - 2558.69s |  who are as hungover as you guys are. Um, so, uh,
2558.73s - 2561.45s |  there's also Gatorades up here if y'all want them. Uh,
2561.45s - 2566.45s |  I brought some of them just for you. Um, on the lamest vendor response,
2566.53s - 2570.65s |  the reason why we give this award out is that when a company makes business
