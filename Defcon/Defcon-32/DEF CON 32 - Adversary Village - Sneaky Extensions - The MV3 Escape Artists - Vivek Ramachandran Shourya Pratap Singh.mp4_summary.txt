**Introduction**
- Vivek Ramachandran and Shaurya Pratap Singh discussed "Sneaky Extensions: The MV3 Escape Artists."
- Vivek has 20 years of experience in **cyber security** and runs Squarex, a **security company**.
- Shaurya is a principal software engineer at Squarex, focusing on **malicious extensions**.

**Browser Extensions**
- **Browser extensions** are widely used for convenience.
- Extensions can cause **back doors** and **attacks** within organizations.
- Demonstrates a browser extension that can **steal live calls** on platforms like Google Meet and Zoom.

**Extension Vulnerabilities**
- Many extensions are **backdoored**, providing attackers with access.

- The **Chrome store** performs high-level checks, missing many vulnerabilities.

**Extension Structure and Permissions**
- Extensions have a **manifest file**, **service worker**, **content script**, and sometimes an **HTML page**.
- **Manifest.json file** specifies permissions, crucial for understanding extension behavior.
- Moving from **version 2 to version 3** for better clarity in permissions.

**Security Concerns**
- Extensions often ask for **dangerous permissions** like access to all URLs.
- **Chromium's multi-process architecture** helps isolate processes for security.
- **Content scripts** can modify web pages without explicit permissions, posing risks.

**Remote Code Execution**
- **Remote code execution** allows executing unmonitored code via extensions.
- Measures in **MV3 version** aim to block dangerous functions like **eval**.
- **JavaScript** quirks can bypass some security measures.

**Demonstrations**
- **Social engineering** demo shows a malicious extension pretending to update Zoom.
- **Live call interception** demo shows an extension capturing Google Meet sessions.
- **Silent account hijacking** demo involves unauthorized access to a GitHub account.
- **Password manager interference** demo shows how extensions can redirect login attempts.

**Conclusion**
- Even trusted extensions can become untrusted through **supply chain attacks**.
- Extensions on the **Chrome store** can be bought and misused by attackers.
