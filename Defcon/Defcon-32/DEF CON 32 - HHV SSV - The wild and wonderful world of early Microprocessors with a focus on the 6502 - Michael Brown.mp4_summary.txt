**Introduction**
- Thank attendees for coming
- Overview of the talk's focus on the **8-bit microprocessors** and the **MOS6502**

**Speaker's Background**
- Name: **<NAME>**
- Grew up in the era of **8-bit computers** like **Apple II**, **Atari 8-bit**, and **Commodore 8-bit**
- First game console: **Atari 2600**
- First computer: **Atari 800XL**
- Experience with programming languages: **6502** and **68000**
- Computer science major, not a computer engineer

**Computer Types**
- **Mainframes**, **minicomputers**, and **microcomputers**
- **Microcomputers** evolved from hobbyist machines to business computers
- **Microcontrollers** are often used to control hardware

**Semiconductor Manufacturers**
- **Shockley Semiconductor**: Founded by transistor inventor **William Shockley**
- **Fairchild Semiconductor**: Created by the "traitorous eight" who left Shockley
- **Fairchildren**: Companies founded by former Fairchild employees
- **Intel**: Co-founded by two Fairchild engineers, known for memory chips and the **4004**
- **Zilog**: Founded by former Intel engineers, creators of the **Z80**
- **Motorola**: Creators of the **6800**, **68000**, and **88000**
- **MOS Technology**: Hired engineers from Motorola, creators of the **6501** and **6502**
- **Commodore**: Acquired MOS Technology, used their chips in Commodore and Amiga computers
- **Western Design Company**: Founded by a former MOS employee, licensed the **6502** chip
- **Texas Instruments**: Focused on calculators, created the **TMS 9900** processor
- **National Semiconductor**: Created the **32,000** processor series
- **RCA**: Created the **1802** 8-bit processor, used in space probes

**Microprocessor Comparison**
- **6800** had 72 instructions, originally priced at $360, reduced to $179, then $69
- **6502** had 55 instructions, originally priced at $25, improved manufacturing yield
- **6502** used in Apple I, Apple II, Atari home game systems, Commodore PET, Nintendo, and more
- **6502** has a faster clock speed than the **68000**
- **6502** has fewer registers and a smaller address bus than the **68000**

**Assembly Language Programming**
- High-level programming languages use constructs like if-then statements and loops
- Assembly language requires building logic using compare and math commands
