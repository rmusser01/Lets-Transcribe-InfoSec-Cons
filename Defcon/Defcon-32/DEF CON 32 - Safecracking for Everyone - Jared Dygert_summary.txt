**Introduction to Safecracking**

- Jared Dygert is a **lock sport enthusiast** with nearly 20 years of experience
- Focus of talk: **mechanical combination safe locks** and their vulnerabilities
- Emphasis on **Group Two mechanical safe locks**, their flaws, and exploitation techniques

**Types of Safe Locks**

- **Group Two**: Standard security classification
- **Group 2M**: Enhanced security with harder manipulation
- **Group One**: High security with extra features, withstands manipulation for 20 hours
- **Group 1R**: Radiologically resistant, made to resist x-ray attacks

**Components of a Safe Lock**

- **Drive Cam**: Central brass circle connected to the dial
- **Lever and Nose**: Nose rests on top of the drive cam
- **Wheels and Gates**: Wheels with gates align with the combination
- **Fence**: Bar that falls into the gates when aligned

**Mechanism of Operation**

- Dialing the combination aligns gates under the fence
- Drive cam turns, allowing the nose to retract the bolt
- Wheels are moved by the **drive cam** through contact with drive pins

**Safecracking Techniques**

- Identify **contact points** and **gate signatures**
- Use **wheel isolation** to determine correct combination numbers
- **Common low point**: Find a point where no bumps interfere with the fence

**Challenges and Vulnerabilities**

- Asymmetrical drop-in area leads to detectable resistance
- Larger or irregular wheels affect the positioning of the fence
- **Brute force**: Used for the first wheel after determining the other two numbers

**Variations in Safe Locks**

- **Legar 3330**: Oval wheels complicate detection
- **Diebold Locks**: U-shaped drive cam allows symmetrical readings
- **Sergeant and Greenleaf Models**: Easier to start with, slight differences in ease of opening

**Practical Tips**

- Be **precise** in reading and dialing
- Use a **known combination** for practice
- Remove back cover to visualize inner workings

**Resources and Further Learning**

- **In-person demonstrations** at lock-picking village
- **Safe Cracking for Everyone** book available as a PDF
- **Online communities**: Lock Picking Subreddit, LPU Discord
- **Sophie Safe Cracking Simulator**: Game for practice
- Continued practice essential for proficiency

**Conclusion**

- **In-person demonstrations** available post-talk
- Apologies for technical difficulties during the presentation
