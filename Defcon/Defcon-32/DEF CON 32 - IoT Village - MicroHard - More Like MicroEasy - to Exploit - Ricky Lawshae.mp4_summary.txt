**Introduction:**
- Speaker: Hedlo Seek
- Talk: **Micro Hard, More Like Micro Easy**
- **Micro Hard**: Canadian-based device manufacturer
- **Device Under Discussion**: Bullet LTE-NA2 (LTE bridge for adding cellular connectivity to serial and ethernet devices)

**Device Overview:**
- **Processor**: 32-bit ARM Cortex-A5
- **Firmware Chip**: Spansion, 128 megs (entire file system is read-write)
- **RAM**: 256 megs
- **Modem**: QuekTel EC25-AF
- **Connections**: SIM card slot, PoE, Ethernet, USB, serial, and programmable I/O ports
- **Firmware Updates**: Unsigned and unencrypted, easily forgeable, and extractable with binwalk

**Firmware Contents:**
- **Bootloader**
- **Linux Kernel**: 3.6.9
- **File System**: Full SquashFS, allowing easy system emulation

**Software Overview:**
- **OS**: Based on OpenWRT
- **Web**: UHT2PD (changed to lightTPD in subsequent versions)
- **SSH**: DropBear
- **Telnet**: TelnetD (drops users into a jailed debug environment)
- **UDP Discovery Service**: Sends/answers discovery probes on ports 2077, 87, or 97, providing MAC/IP address, host name, SSID, model, firmware version, and NMS details

**Web Management Portal:**
- **Focus of Audit**: UHC2PD, based on 2014 OpenWRT version
- **Configuration**: Allows management of all device aspects, accessible from LAN and WAN (enabled by default)
- **Shell Scripts**: Each page is a shell script wrapped in a GUI, leading to multiple command injections
- **Diagnostics Page**: Allows ping, which always has command injection
- **Demo**: Post-auth command injection to gain root shell

**Authentication Issues:**
- **Logins**: Generic, using basic auth (base64 encoded user:pass)
- **Logouts**: Mistake in handling logout requests, leading to buffer overflow
- **Demo**: In-the-wild ARM ROP exploit, bypassing DEP and ASLR, to gain shell access

**Telnet Portal:**
- **Jailed Environment**: Provides access to AT commands for the QuackTel modem
- **CLI Test**: Defines AT commands, including undocumented "ATMBashCommand"
- **Vulnerable Command Validation**: Case compare with length check on "PS" or "cat" allows arbitrary command execution
- **Demo**: Post-auth command injection via "ATMBashCommand" to gain root shell

**Conclusion:**
- **Vulnerabilities**: Fixed with vague release notes, minimizing impact
- **Recommendations**: Implement secure development processes and provide detailed release notes
