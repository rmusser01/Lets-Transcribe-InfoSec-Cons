0.00s - 6.82s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 My name is Nikita. I am the Director of Content and Coordination for DEF CON. I am the
6.82s - 11.82s |  Chief Hacker Wrangler. Um so I handle a lot of the logistical operations for DEF CON as well
15.56s - 22.56s |  as um sort of wrangle a lot of the department leads like that you see here. I wanted to
22.56s - 27.56s |  start out with um a little quick introduction and then give you a brief overview. Um we
28.56s - 33.56s |  have um a null value Drew. Yeah. Did I just dox him? I just. You said his name. I'm so
37.74s - 42.74s |  sorry. Oh man. Then we have. That's how we start this off. This is going great. That
44.88s - 49.88s |  too. Then we have Grifter. Grifter is the lead for our contest and uh events for DEF
50.08s - 55.08s |  CON and then we have Ada who runs our wonderful hotline program and um I have some notes
63.06s - 68.30s |  here and I will be perfectly honest with you I am a nervous speaker so I'm clutching
68.30s - 73.10s |  the podium. You're doing great. I mean I'm like you're it's fantastic. Is she doing
73.10s - 80.21s |  great? Absolutely. I thought that cheering would make you more nervous. Did it work? A
80.21s - 85.95s |  little bit. Alright. Alright. Thank you. Back me up when we do that again. Okay. So
85.95s - 94.27s |  um some things I wanted to let you know is that um if you are looking for something to
94.27s - 99.27s |  do um you can come to this facility between 8 a.m. and 2 a.m. So we are open that whole
102.45s - 108.01s |  entire time so if you are bored in your hotel room and you don't know anybody you can come
108.01s - 113.01s |  down. There's some social events tonight. There's parties. There's people that are just
113.01s - 119.09s |  sitting around hacking on stuff. Um I'm plenty of people to talk to. Plenty of things to do.
119.09s - 125.83s |  Lots of stuff happens at night that is just unplanned and um it's always fun to see what
125.83s - 132.73s |  people come up with every year but um we have things like laser Tetris. We have um multiple
132.75s - 140.19s |  parties so if you are here just because these halls close at 6 p.m. doesn't mean the rest of
140.19s - 145.21s |  Defcon does. So from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. and then in our hall in the halls that you're in now are
148.91s - 153.91s |  open from 10 to 6 so villages, contests, those are those all close around at 6. Um oh we have
153.91s - 158.91s |  one really really important rule and usually we refer to it as the 3-2-1 rule and that means
165.11s - 170.11s |  3 hours of sleep, 2 meals, 1 shower. Now we're kind of all getting on in our age and um this is
174.39s - 179.39s |  my 21st Defcon. Speak for yourself I'm spring chicken. And I can't do 3 hours of sleep
179.61s - 184.61s |  anymore so I have made an executive decision to therefore mandate that it is now 6 hours of
188.39s - 193.39s |  sleep. So 6 hours of sleep, 2 meals, and 1 shower every day. Please. I advocate for uh 6 hours of
196.33s - 201.33s |  sleep. 3 meals, 2 showers. Last night I got 3 hours and 3 minutes of sleep. I am killing it.
202.29s - 209.78s |  It's important to take care of yourself. Las Vegas is really big. It's hot outside. There's lots
212.22s - 216.92s |  of traveling. Um it's really easy to get dehydrated. It's one of the number 1 things that
216.92s - 221.70s |  happens to people when they're not feeling well at Defcon. It's because you are dehydrated and
221.70s - 226.70s |  speaking from personal personal experience here you need to drink water or you might die. So
227.12s - 232.12s |  drink water. Um another thing another rule is listen to the goons. I'm sure you guys have
235.30s - 242.86s |  noticed the goons in the hallways directing you to the left to the right. Whoever just made
242.86s - 247.86s |  that announcement I heard. Um listen to them and if they're yelling it's only to get your
250.40s - 255.40s |  attention. Um never really to be unkind intentionally. Um if you do have any problems
263.32s - 270.16s |  with goons you can either email feedback at Defcon.org or you can call the hotline and um we'll
270.16s - 275.16s |  get to that. Um Defcon is about trying new things. Um we're all noobs here. Even me. I may be
282.58s - 287.58s |  21 years but I still consider myself a noob at lots of stuff and that's cool. That's okay. Um
288.28s - 293.28s |  it's a choose your own adventure here. You don't have to think oh I have to have this
296.66s - 300.52s |  checklist. I have to go to talks. I have to go to this village. I have to go to that village. I
300.52s - 306.70s |  have to go to that village. You if you find something that you are interested in 1 the talks
306.70s - 313.70s |  will be online later. So you can catch them later. You can catch up later. But also find your
313.72s - 320.06s |  people. Find the thing that gets you really jazzed up. And you'll know it when you find it.
320.06s - 326.48s |  You'll know when you don't really want to leave an area. Don't. It's okay. It'll all that other
326.48s - 331.48s |  stuff will be here next year. Um have fun. Uh try new things. And there's a lot of things.
334.82s - 341.18s |  One of the things about our villages and and to a degree a lot of our contests is I try to
341.20s - 348.20s |  ensure that no matter where you are at DAF CON you can have 0 knowledge about a subject. It
348.20s - 354.82s |  doesn't matter what village it is. They have a something that you can walk in and you can
354.82s - 359.82s |  learn. You can go in. Do a thing. Have a workshop. Do a an activity. Build a badge. Um work
362.80s - 368.06s |  a solution out for something. Right off the street anybody's grandmother can come in and learn
368.08s - 373.08s |  something new and then walk walk out the better or more curious or for it. Um so don't be
376.08s - 381.08s |  afraid to ask questions. Don't be afraid to say I don't I don't know how to do this. Show me. Or
383.50s - 389.36s |  um hey I'm really interested in this but I don't want to do it alone. It's okay to collaborate.
389.36s - 395.60s |  And it's okay to compete too. We have things like scavenger hunt which are absolutely amazing
395.62s - 400.98s |  for going out and meeting people and trying new things. Getting these new experiences. Things
400.98s - 405.98s |  that you're not going to get at other conferences because we are so very unique as a culture, as a
409.40s - 414.40s |  community, as a conference that we have so many things that you can do to collaborate.
419.10s - 424.00s |  Can I make a comment on that too? Um so you're saying like yeah go out and try new things. Do
424.24s - 429.38s |  new things. I I think something that I hear really often is people will say oh well I don't know
429.38s - 433.78s |  anything about that. Like so it's like oh you should go check out the aerospace village. And
433.78s - 438.92s |  they're like but I don't know anything about that. And it's like there's this misconception that
438.92s - 445.92s |  you're going there to um use your vast amount of knowledge of the aerospace industry to it. That's
445.92s - 450.44s |  that's not what that's about. The people who are in there and creating the villages are really
450.44s - 456.72s |  excited about sharing what they know with you. So you can walk in with absolutely no knowledge. I
456.72s - 461.38s |  hear people say things like oh I don't really go to DEF CON because I'm not very technical. And
461.38s - 466.38s |  it's like it's not necessarily about just being technical. It's about going, learning, growing and
469.10s - 474.00s |  again trying new things. You may be the best car hacker that exists and you don't know because
474.00s - 478.94s |  you've never given it a shot. So go in and just approach somebody and say I've never done
478.94s - 484.18s |  anything with this before. Can somebody show me? And if they don't immediately show you they'll
484.18s - 488.68s |  point you to the person who will. So just don't be shy. I know it's difficult for us. It's very
488.68s - 495.22s |  prevalent that we're introverted in this in this community, in this industry and all those things.
495.22s - 500.86s |  Just just try. Just go up and be like I don't know how to do this. Will somebody show me? And you
500.86s - 505.84s |  can have some of the best experiences. I know that's been huge personally for me and for my own
505.84s - 511.74s |  growth as a person and as a hacker. Just walking up and being like what are you doing? What does
511.74s - 517.74s |  that mean? And then watching the other person get excited about sharing that with you. So yeah.
519.08s - 525.62s |  Yeah in my opinion the the only precursor or prerequisite for attending DEF CON successfully is a
525.62s - 531.36s |  willingness to learn. If you're not willing to learn, why are you here? Everyone's willing to
531.36s - 539.92s |  help. The $25 chicken tenders. Yes. That's why they're here. Or the $30 burgers. Yeah I agree with
539.92s - 546.80s |  that. And I would say that I've noticed some people their first DEF CON say you can see when
546.80s - 554.64s |  they've been they've been shut down before and they say I'm sorry sorry I'm going on a rant. Don't
554.64s - 559.72s |  be sorry. That's what we're all here for. Go on the damn rant. Say the thing. Tell us what you're
559.72s - 567.98s |  excited about. Talk about it. Because we're all like that. We're all here for a reason. And I I
567.98s - 572.82s |  feel like I've heard it bunches and bunches of times. People they come and they're like I found my
572.82s - 580.16s |  people. Yeah. And that's why we've got people who have been gooning for so long. It's because we
580.16s - 587.20s |  found our people. We want to make sure everybody else does too. So. Grifter. Yes. What type of
587.20s - 594.56s |  contests do we have this year? I'm so glad you asked me that question Nikita. As the head of the
594.56s - 601.86s |  contest and events here at DEF CON. Honestly we've got everything. If you for me I like our motto for
601.86s - 607.12s |  the contest and events is not one talk not even one. All right. And Nikita mentioned that a little
607.12s - 615.16s |  bit. I'm sorry I say to the head of content. But but our our thing is that you can watch the talks
615.16s - 622.50s |  later on YouTube but you won't have the people that are here sitting around you at home. They may be
622.50s - 630.08s |  watching you but they're just not there in the room. Yeah that's good for your anxiety. Anyway. So I
630.08s - 634.46s |  always say like go and try the things that are here that you can't have when you're when you're gone.
634.46s - 637.80s |  Now that doesn't mean if there's something that you're super passionate about and you know there's a
637.80s - 644.80s |  talk that you want to see or your friend is speaking go support you know yell woo out in the crowd. But
645.34s - 652.12s |  but genuinely like for me one of the things that I enjoyed the most about DEF CON in the early years
652.12s - 660.74s |  that I was coming was competing in a contest like it forced me to get outside of my comfort zone forced
660.74s - 668.62s |  me to interact with strangers frankly right. Who all you know use spooky names and and work on things
668.62s - 677.70s |  that I didn't know how to do like I a contest is what introduced me to lock picking like I just I there
677.70s - 683.38s |  was a part of a contest that I didn't know how to do it and I was like oh no and I couldn't get past a
683.38s - 689.44s |  certain thing and eventually I got help from someone else and then I was like okay that's something I
689.44s - 694.74s |  need to learn. So I I went and bought a bunch of picks and I spent the next year picking locks so that
694.74s - 699.78s |  when I came back the next year to compete in the contest I knew when I hit that bar I would be ready to go
699.78s - 708.46s |  right so it forced me to continue to develop myself. So we have everything from again aerospace type of car
708.46s - 715.02s |  hacking or just plain weird like the scavenger hunt and I love the scavenger hunt. I ran it for years back
715.02s - 719.76s |  when we were at the Alexis Park. Didn't you create it? What's that? Didn't you create it? No Pinguino
719.76s - 724.26s |  created it. Oh okay. Yeah I didn't create it. Pinguino created it she ran it for a couple of years and then
724.26s - 730.76s |  she reached out to me and said I'm not going to be able to be at DEF CON can you take this over and so we
730.76s - 736.86s |  just we we removed answer it who is it no answer it answer it on stage answer it on stage do it please
736.86s - 743.64s |  please please do it. Oh Nikita it would have been weird. Oh keep DEF CON weird. So speaking of the
743.64s - 749.84s |  scavenger hunt we just put a bunch of really weird stuff on there and so when you see somebody doing
749.86s - 758.90s |  something incredibly odd it might be the scavenger hunt or they might just be neuro spicy I don't know but but go
758.90s - 767.18s |  and and compete in things that push you to learn new skills or just push you to keep DEF CON weird and I know
767.18s - 775.12s |  we all try to do that. So I have another question for you. How many black badges do you have and what are they
775.14s - 781.84s |  and how can you get them. Yeah I don't know how many. How many do I have Nikita. You tell me since you're the one who
781.84s - 790.26s |  tells me. I've given up at this point. Okay so normally I mean how many have you won. How many have I won personally.
790.30s - 799.56s |  Three. So I competed in a contest. Oh what's a black badge you ask. A black badge is when you certain contests will be
799.58s - 808.14s |  given a black badge for the winner of that contest and that gets you free entry into DEF CON for life. And that started at
808.14s - 816.22s |  DEF CON I guess 10 technically or 9 technically because somebody got it for the cyber ethical challenge or something and
816.22s - 824.60s |  then the next year we had actual black badges. So it started really at DEF CON 10 and has gone ever since. And no one
824.60s - 831.98s |  knows which contest is going to get that up front. And that's on purpose. We want you to compete in the contest that are of
831.98s - 840.34s |  interest to you. And then maybe you might win a black badge versus just being like oh that contest gets a black badge. I'll
840.34s - 842.84s |  focus on that. Right. Yeah.
845.36s - 852.16s |  18 by the way. That's the number of badges. There are 18 black badges. Eight of them go to CTF. The rest of them go to the
852.16s - 860.04s |  rest of the contest. The black badge is also known as the uber badge. Uber. Yeah. So that could be you. I mean super in German.
860.24s - 869.51s |  One of you out here. Does that mean that. Hello German friends. No. Scheisse. Ada.
874.34s - 882.90s |  Many fans. And thank you. Just the ones in the front row. What. I would like to ask you a couple of questions. What is
882.90s - 892.46s |  hotline. So hotline is a service that's been going for five DEF CONs now but that's seven years. So you know canceled DEF CONs
892.46s - 903.06s |  unfortunately. You can call it for a number of things. We have people who are there all throughout the con to answer your questions
903.06s - 916.06s |  about various information things but even more so if you have conduct issues with anybody we can call and talk to us. If you are in a
916.06s - 925.82s |  crisis if you're having a panic attack if you are not feeling comfortable at con if you just need somebody to talk to they're trained to
925.82s - 930.50s |  handle all of those things. And that's why the front row is screaming at me. Yeah.
930.50s - 943.86s |  I personally can say that there are a lot of people who are very happy for what hotline does. And I know that you spent several weeks doing
943.86s - 953.78s |  training with our goons with volunteers to talk about how to escalate a call how to deescalate a call how to you know deal with the things
953.78s - 964.22s |  that hotline is there for for our attendees. And I just think that's amazing. They actually start. I start looking for people in February. We
964.22s - 974.86s |  pick people early March. They start class late March. They go once a week every week until DEF CON. So it's a little extensive but it's also the
974.86s - 985.70s |  same training that I did when I used to work for suicide prevention hotlines. So they can help you with anything. You can just call and talk if
985.70s - 1000.98s |  you need to. Yeah. And why did hotline start. Hotline started in 2018 and the year before. We had an issue where someone came forward with an
1000.98s - 1011.62s |  issue. The goon who tried to take the incident from her didn't know how to handle it properly. So he's looking for me because I come from a background in
1011.62s - 1023.90s |  psychology. Suicide prevention hotline. And couldn't find me. And when he finally found me, she had disappeared. And at that point in time, all of the
1023.90s - 1033.14s |  people at DEF CON were like, how can we make this not happen again? How can we get somebody who's going through that someplace to talk to so they can come
1033.14s - 1044.22s |  forward and they can feel comfortable from the comfort of their hotel room if they need to. And that's sort of where we came from. Just someplace with a
1044.22s - 1054.78s |  comforting voice to talk to. Yeah. I'm sure you take a lot of like serious calls, serious things that you, you know, but what is your kind of corkiest, your
1054.78s - 1066.10s |  weirdest, your funniest? I have to say we do get calls from people trapped in back of house. If you find a door and you don't know where it goes to, I highly
1066.10s - 1076.70s |  recommend not going in it. I, on the other hand, say go through the door. Do it. You may get trapped. We've already had one this year. And we've had a few in the
1076.70s - 1088.30s |  past. Strange doors may lead to a bunch of locked rooms that you can't get out of. Go through the door. But Holloween is there for you to make sure that you find your way
1088.30s - 1102.02s |  out. You have a backup. They'll come get you. Go through the door. Facilities might come get you too. And they might not like you after that. Nikita, can I go up there? No, please. No. Can
1102.02s - 1111.10s |  someone take me? No, please. No. Somebody turn off this mic. Immediately. No.
1111.58s - 1129.55s |  I know he wakes up every morning and chooses violence. He really does. He is. Get up. I mean, he's like, he's like a little kitten. Oh, I'm getting up there. I'm throwing it down. Selfie kicked out of
1129.55s - 1159.92s |  facilities. That's only if you get caught. And no, I don't know. But that's my boy right there. I bet. Let me ask you a question. Tell us a little bit about what Hacker Tracker is. Obviously, an app that tracks hackers now. Can it track them across the rafters? Only if they're up there and they're not.
1162.24s - 1192.12s |  Hacker Tracker is the conference information app for DEF CON and numerous other conferences. DEF CON is the biggest by far. We were started by Whitney maybe a decade ago. I joined the team in DC 27, I believe it was. We're the ones that provide the schedule to you. Please install Hacker Tracker on your phone. We don't actually track hackers. It doesn't matter how many comments we get on
1192.12s - 1201.00s |  Google or Apple asking us to track hackers. We're not going to do it. It's an open source app. You can read our source if you want. It's on GitHub.
1203.12s - 1211.32s |  So tracking hackers is not a feature. But what is your favorite feature about or your newest features about Hacker Tracker?
1213.54s - 1233.54s |  So the newest features are a more easy way to see contests and events and parties so that you can just look at the list of them on screen rather than having to search through the schedule for them. And this year we added a feedback option for all of the official content. So please use that feature.
1234.98s - 1237.54s |  And how does the feedback? How does the feedback work?
1237.54s - 1267.32s |  As soon as this talk starts, you're short a few minutes after, I think. You can open the talk. Just search for it if you don't already have it open in Hacker Tracker. A button will appear at the bottom. Just clearly says submit feedback. We've, Ada and I, have worked closely to select the questions. Our big question we want to know is, quote unquote, is it hacker? Courtesy of DT.
1271.16s - 1272.12s |  Give me my microphone back.
1272.12s - 1298.20s |  So please click yes on that or we're all going to be fired. So just say yes, positive feedback. And you know, the what is hacker thing, I can speak to that a little bit, is that it's really important to Jeff that we maintain hacker culture, even though InfoSec has expanded to be so great compared to what it was, you know, back when this was started.
1298.92s - 1327.32s |  Now all of our hackers are in InfoSec. We still we're finding things that people want to share things. But we are not an InfoSec conference. We are not about that. And so sometimes what is hacker can be what is just the curious nature of what you found and how and why. And it's not for a corporation. It's not for your job. It's not for anybody. But you and the information and sharing that knowledge so that it is open and free. Now, obviously, we like, you know,
1327.40s - 1328.68s |  like what's behind that door.
1333.62s - 1344.66s |  I will say that when we were told that are we were supposed to find out, is it hacker? We kind of just walked around for a while going, is it hacker? Is it hacker? Is it hacker? Is this hacker?
1346.66s - 1348.78s |  Yeah, we're not tracking those.
1349.78s - 1363.10s |  I realized that I said courtesy of DT. Since this is a one on one panel, you may not know much about DEF CON. DT is the dark tangent, or Jeff. He is Nikita's boss.
1364.78s - 1365.90s |  Sometimes my boss.
1367.90s - 1368.62s |  Sometimes
1369.50s - 1385.26s |  So this, I don't know if you can see that it says definitely not a tracker. And it has a tile in it. Because the number one question asked to the contest and events goon is where is grifter? Or have you seen grifter? And so this year, they low jacked me.
1385.26s - 1396.22s |  So all of them have access to a shared link that will tell them where I am in the facility at any given time, or if I've left my hotel. So hacker tracker.
1397.82s - 1414.06s |  He has not given me that link. And I don't know to next year, it will be revised so that he has a boundary zone. So instead, he will have to remain in a certain area or it will go off. And he will get a few warnings, almost like how I trained my dog.
1415.50s - 1417.02s |  Dog not to leave the yard.
1418.38s - 1443.58s |  It's a good time to do it. He will get a shock. That's my you know what I might just create that next year. We will have a button to shock grifter. Can you shock him? And the more people who who vote to shock you, you'll get a shot. Push the button. How much does the FF get for every time I get shocked? How much do you want to get? Let's talk. You guys were talking right now. I'm serious. I will arrange this. It will have DEF CON weird.
1444.54s - 1465.18s |  $5. So you have it has to be done on the catwalk. You have a hacker tracker. Does it know your elevation? Like how can you get caught if it doesn't? That's a good question. Oh, yeah. Does it track his elevation? They can't see me up there. Yes, they can. Right through that window.
1465.18s - 1473.47s |  Getting up there. He's not. When you get stuck, you can call hotline.
1475.39s - 1492.67s |  He would get stuck too. This is the part of the panel where we like to take questions from the audience. And we have a microphone there in the middle aisle. And you are free to ask any question you want to ask. And we will try to do our best to answer it.
1492.75s - 1505.31s |  Seriously, and with respect, he noticed I looked at him. I have tiny chickens for people to ask questions. All right. All right. What does the chicken sound like? Chicken?
1507.07s - 1521.90s |  I don't know. I don't want that. Do it. Are they transcribing this live? I don't know. Transcription right now. I was a chicken sound. What is what do they type when when she does the chicken sound? Do the chicken sound? What did they type?
1522.86s - 1540.06s |  Nothing. Do it louder. They didn't get it. They're glaring at us from offstage. I was a moderately sane person about two rubber chickens ago. They're little. You know, after that, um, give me that chicken. Those dang things.
1540.06s - 1568.22s |  If anybody doesn't have a question, I found these cute little camp talk conversation question cards, gather around and make new friends with camp talk. And we are often referred to as the part of hacker summer camp, which is, you know, besides Black Hat, DEF CON. So if people don't come up soon, I'm going to start asking them random questions from the from the deck.
1568.22s - 1600.67s |  Question. We've got one, which is, we've got to take it. Yes, she should have a chicken. Oh, that's can she have a date? That's that was hacker shit right there. That is that is it. That is it. Next year. We need need to be more specific. Good. Ask questions. Um, I've been I've been gooning for 23 years. So it's a long time you what you say 21 years. We've been around a while. How many years?
1601.67s - 1605.67s |  Six years. That's all right. And how many years?
1605.67s - 1608.67s |  Uh, let's see. I've been working for 10 this year.
1608.67s - 1610.67s |  You're gonna retire, aren't you?
1610.67s - 1611.67s |  No, no, no.
1611.67s - 1612.67s |  Yeah.
1612.67s - 1616.67s |  But I've been around since the rib days.
1616.67s - 1617.67s |  All right. Nice.
1618.67s - 1639.67s |  There's a lot of DEF CON experience up here as also as attendees. And I mentioned something and I'll tell you what what I'm what that means what I said at 10 years if you've been a goon for 10 years you can retire and when you retire you get a gold badge like a gold goon badge and you can come to DEF CON for free for life just like the black badge because you put in your 10 years.
1639.67s - 1659.67s |  So I will also add to that. So if you see somebody like Nikita who has 20 years on their patch on their lanyard like they could have stopped doing this a long time ago and just started coming. So when you see any number above 10 they love this right they choose to do this and that doesn't mean that somebody has been doing it six years doesn't love it.
1659.67s - 1674.67s |  I'm sure there will be a 10 year patch and a 15 year patch and 25 year patch right like so. So, the people who are are wearing those patches they they love being here so, you know, approach them ask them questions.
1674.67s - 1692.43s |  How do you become a goon?
1692.43s - 1693.43s |  Okay.
1693.43s - 1697.43s |  Would you like a chicken? It's happening right now. You're becoming a goon.
1697.43s - 1700.43s |  This is this is how you're chosen.
1700.43s - 1710.43s |  So that is a very good question and I will say right now we are in a transition period where we are trying to come up with a formal application process to become a goon.
1710.43s - 1718.43s |  Traditionally in the past you would become a goon because you went out and you said I can help with that.
1718.43s - 1738.43s |  And you and the person was like fuck yeah I need help with that come on over here and you developed trust you developed a relationship with a goon you started working with them they're like hey you're you're helpful can you come back next year and be a goon and that's usually how it happened or it's like I know a guy a friend knows a guy they recommend each other.
1738.43s - 1764.43s |  But over the years we have like 600 goons now and we don't want it just to be someone you know to in order to get to be a goon. So if you are an attendee and you don't know a goon, you know, go out make friends with goons we love it, but we also want a process that is a little bit more open to to apply to.
1764.43s - 1784.43s |  I will say that 10 years ago I watched a panel about women at DEF CON and CJ the guy who was in charge of the SOC said we just need more women to be SOC goons and we don't know how to get them and I just literally stood up and said I do that job and he said email me.
1784.43s - 1785.43s |  Yeah.
1785.43s - 1786.43s |  10 years later I'm still here.
1787.43s - 1815.43s |  It was last night actually my my best friend was saying to me that she heard from a couple of people that were having a conversation and they said yeah DEF CON is not the same as what it used to be and that they feel like that we've become more diverse and they actually felt safer here because of our diversity and also because of our wonderful programs like hotline and you know we have all of our goons now.
1816.43s - 1819.43s |  Oh please answer it. Come on. Do it this time. Who is it? Who is it?
1819.43s - 1820.43s |  Who is it?
1820.43s - 1822.43s |  It's the lead I got not the lead I wanted.
1823.43s - 1824.43s |  Let's go.
1824.43s - 1825.43s |  Hello?
1825.43s - 1826.43s |  Put them near the speaker.
1826.43s - 1833.43s |  You're on stage. You're on stage right now with me. I'm giving a talk. You had the audacity to call me.
1836.43s - 1837.43s |  Make them say hi.
1837.43s - 1838.43s |  What do you want to say to the audience?
1839.43s - 1841.43s |  See if I put you on speaker. Hold on.
1841.43s - 1842.43s |  Say it loud. Okay.
1842.43s - 1843.43s |  Go ahead.
1843.43s - 1855.32s |  Hello audience. I want to help rectify the situation that is people modifying the lighting situation inside of the entire hall.
1856.32s - 1857.32s |  Boring.
1857.32s - 1862.32s |  You have to put me on blast for that. I'll deal with that when I'm off stage.
1863.32s - 1866.32s |  Bye now. Bye. No, they're boring. Hang on right now. They're boring.
1868.32s - 1871.32s |  Boring. No, you're boring. You're boring. Goodbye. You're cut off.
1872.32s - 1873.32s |  That's another question.
1873.32s - 1875.32s |  As I was talking to him, someone else was calling me.
1877.32s - 1879.70s |  What was I saying?
1879.70s - 1880.70s |  I have no idea.
1881.70s - 1883.70s |  This is what peer pressure will get to you.
1885.70s - 1886.70s |  Diversity at DefCon.
1886.70s - 1887.70s |  You said a best friend.
1888.70s - 1891.70s |  We used to all wear different colored shirts depending on what we did.
1891.70s - 1893.70s |  Info booth would have a green shirt.
1894.70s - 1896.70s |  Sock would have a red shirt.
1896.70s - 1897.70s |  Speaker ops would blue.
1897.70s - 1899.70s |  We used to color code what we did.
1901.70s - 1903.70s |  The rest of the goons blended in.
1904.70s - 1909.70s |  It felt like people didn't see the diversity of our real goon stuff, which is absolutely amazing.
1909.70s - 1912.70s |  I've never really experienced that anywhere else.
1913.70s - 1914.70s |  Any other con even.
1917.70s - 1920.70s |  That guy has a question, so I'm going to stop talking.
1936.09s - 1937.09s |  Really quick before she answers.
1937.09s - 1938.09s |  They're really light.
1938.09s - 1940.09s |  You just pick them up and carry them.
1940.09s - 1941.09s |  No.
1942.09s - 1943.09s |  I knew it.
1946.09s - 1947.09s |  Come at me, front row.
1947.09s - 1948.09s |  I'm ready.
1948.09s - 1949.09s |  Would you like your chicken?
1950.09s - 1952.09s |  I made sure that you can have multiple colors.
1952.09s - 1953.09s |  In case you don't want pink.
1957.09s - 1958.09s |  Put my psychology hat back on.
1959.09s - 1964.09s |  There's some research that suggests that we tend to lose girls in middle school.
1965.09s - 1970.09s |  They may be brilliant at math and sciences in elementary school.
1970.09s - 1972.09s |  But in middle school, they're told girls don't do that.
1973.09s - 1989.09s |  So my priority has always been going into the middle schools and teaching soldering or coding or making fun projects and trying to get the girls involved at that point.
1989.09s - 1992.09s |  I know there's a lot of work being done in that space.
1992.09s - 2005.09s |  So even if you talk to your local high schools and middle schools, you might find that there's already a girls program for STEM where you could come in and talk to them about what it is you do and maybe lead them through a cool project.
2006.09s - 2008.09s |  Like I said, soldering and coding.
2009.09s - 2018.09s |  We made little necklaces that have little space invaders on them when I did one of my projects with the middle schoolers.
2018.09s - 2024.09s |  So they're excited and ready to do the work, but we really have to keep them going.
2025.09s - 2034.09s |  Yeah, I think I know like for my daughter, there's this like perception that you can't be like a girly girl, but also be into tech, which just isn't true at all.
2034.09s - 2039.09s |  And she started to feel some of that pressure from her peers, like where they were like, oh, like you do this, you do that.
2039.09s - 2041.09s |  And she's like to her, it was just completely normal.
2042.09s - 2051.09s |  Grew up in a house around it all the time, is a hardcore gamer, like just in her brain, none of this is not normal to just do all the time.
2051.09s - 2057.09s |  But then from her own friends at that same age that you were talking about, and she is a very girly girl.
2057.09s - 2062.09s |  But then was like, oh, well, like her friends would be like, oh, where did you get this like makeup organizer?
2062.09s - 2064.09s |  And she's like, I 3D printed it, right?
2064.09s - 2066.09s |  Like, or where did you get whatever?
2066.09s - 2068.09s |  And they're like, you 3D printed it.
2068.09s - 2070.09s |  And she's like, oh, yeah, you can just make it yourself.
2070.09s - 2072.09s |  Look at all these cool designs, we can make this, we can make this.
2072.09s - 2076.09s |  And they're like, oh, wait, maybe I judged this too quickly.
2076.09s - 2080.09s |  Yeah, I remember when I was in high school, and I was very good at math.
2080.09s - 2082.09s |  And then I went into college.
2082.09s - 2092.09s |  Throughout that whole period, I felt like I had to be a tomboy because that was what if I wanted to be able to enjoy video games and technology, I had to be a tomboy.
2092.09s - 2094.09s |  And finally, I gave up on that.
2094.09s - 2096.09s |  And I said, screw it, like skirts and dresses.
2096.09s - 2108.09s |  So find those ways in which you can bring technology and games and those kinds of things into their space.
2108.09s - 2115.09s |  Yeah, and you have to you have to meet them on their level to you have to say things like, wow, you really got a lot of drip today.
2116.09s - 2118.09s |  I'm really impressed by your riz.
2118.09s - 2122.09s |  And no cap, no cap, for real, for real.
2122.09s - 2127.09s |  But Skibidi Toilet, Skibidi, Skibidi Ohio, Skibidi Riz.
2127.09s - 2129.09s |  Facts, no printer.
2129.09s - 2134.09s |  Whoever has to type this, I feel so sorry.
2134.09s - 2135.09s |  That's right.
2135.09s - 2136.09s |  Oh, that's amazing.
2136.09s - 2140.09s |  Yeah, it's just very mid, you know.
2140.09s - 2142.09s |  Ask us a camp question.
2142.09s - 2143.09s |  Okay.
2143.09s - 2144.09s |  Oh, there's a question.
2144.09s - 2145.09s |  Oh, okay.
2145.09s - 2146.09s |  It's a regular question.
2146.09s - 2147.09s |  Sorry.
2149.09s - 2150.09s |  I pickles.
2150.09s - 2151.09s |  Love it.
2151.09s - 2154.36s |  Welcome.
2154.36s - 2155.36s |  Well,
2189.58s - 2190.58s |  we'll help you.
2190.58s - 2193.58s |  So I'm here specifically for one thing.
2193.58s - 2195.58s |  I didn't tell my story.
2197.58s - 2201.58s |  My story, because I'd like to see today in case I have to stop.
2202.58s - 2203.58s |  Because
2206.58s - 2207.58s |  so
2215.58s - 2217.58s |  I have my questions.
2218.58s - 2221.98s |  Let me just say
2222.98s - 2223.98s |  my stocking story.
2223.98s - 2225.98s |  So if I'm being struck, I'm being hacked.
2225.98s - 2227.98s |  And then I'm being struck, I'm being hacked.
2227.98s - 2228.98s |  And that's just how it goes.
2228.98s - 2229.98s |  It's not how it is.
2229.98s - 2232.98s |  But we're GPS tracking on multiple vehicles.
2232.98s - 2234.98s |  But we're bugging on vehicles.
2234.98s - 2236.98s |  I can literally be hurting a child out of my fart.
2238.98s - 2240.98s |  Computer hacking, intelligent hacking.
2240.98s - 2243.98s |  And we can never stop it.
2243.98s - 2246.98s |  So we call this, it has my name spelled, we're gonna stop it.
2246.98s - 2247.98s |  We're gonna stop it.
2247.98s - 2248.98s |  What is the word for stopping?
2248.98s - 2249.98s |  It's a food stocking.
2249.98s - 2251.98s |  We've got a lot of different food stockings.
2251.98s - 2253.98s |  I'm writing a podcast.
2253.98s - 2255.98s |  I'm writing whatever it takes.
2255.98s - 2256.98s |  But I'm writing a podcast.
2256.98s - 2258.98s |  So if you find me here,
2258.98s - 2259.98s |  just call on me.
2260.98s - 2261.98s |  Step on me.
2261.98s - 2262.98s |  Get this person out of my life.
2262.98s - 2264.98s |  He's been in my life for 20 years.
2264.98s - 2265.98s |  He's an actual employer.
2265.98s - 2267.98s |  I'm not going to introduce him.
2267.98s - 2272.98s |  Is there anyone here who would?
2272.98s - 2278.94s |  We have several different villages.
2278.94s - 2283.94s |  You could try from crypto privacy to the social engineering village.
2283.94s - 2287.94s |  We should definitely maybe connect you with someone after the talk.
2287.94s - 2291.94s |  It sounds like this is a little bit more detailed than a question.
2291.94s - 2294.94s |  And happy to work with you afterwards.
2309.27s - 2310.27s |  Noted.
2310.27s - 2311.27s |  Okay.
2311.27s - 2312.27s |  All right.
2312.27s - 2313.27s |  Thank you.
2313.27s - 2315.27s |  Thank you.
2315.27s - 2319.76s |  Okay.
2319.76s - 2320.76s |  All right.
2320.76s - 2321.76s |  Cool.
2321.76s - 2322.76s |  Thank you.
2323.76s - 2324.76s |  Thanks.
2324.76s - 2327.84s |  What you got?
2327.84s - 2328.84s |  Give me a camp question.
2328.84s - 2329.84s |  Let's go.
2331.84s - 2339.84s |  What is the funniest or most unusual nickname you've ever heard for a camp counselor?
2340.84s - 2341.84s |  What would your nickname?
2341.84s - 2342.84s |  Oh, my gosh.
2342.84s - 2344.84s |  I can tell you, but I'd have to out myself.
2345.84s - 2346.84s |  Do it.
2349.15s - 2351.15s |  This is I'm going to regret this so much, though.
2352.15s - 2353.15s |  You know what?
2353.15s - 2355.15s |  This is this for my boy.
2355.15s - 2356.15s |  Okay.
2356.15s - 2360.15s |  So when I first started, when you started as a goon back in the day, in the early single
2360.15s - 2363.15s |  digit DEF CON days, everybody started as a sock goon.
2363.15s - 2367.15s |  You had to start in security, put your time in, and then you'd go on to something else.
2367.15s - 2369.15s |  So I started out as a security goon.
2369.15s - 2374.15s |  And then Russ was like, hey, I'll bring you into the vendors as soon as you put your time
2374.15s - 2375.15s |  in security.
2375.15s - 2377.15s |  And I was like, yeah, that sounds great.
2377.15s - 2379.15s |  I love hanging out in the vendor area.
2379.15s - 2381.15s |  I was a vendor at the time.
2381.15s - 2383.15s |  Oh, I'm going to say this in public.
2383.15s - 2384.15s |  And then I met I met Romer.
2384.15s - 2386.15s |  So our good friend Romer.
2386.15s - 2392.15s |  So so Russ introduces me to Romer and he says, hey, Romer, this is Grifter.
2392.15s - 2395.15s |  And at the time I was younger and handsome.
2395.15s - 2399.15s |  And so so Romer said no.
2400.15s - 2403.15s |  And he was like, you're too good looking to have a cool handle.
2403.15s - 2406.15s |  Your new handle is Nutsack.
2407.15s - 2413.15s |  And Romer and Russ called me Nutsack and have continued to do so for 20 plus years.
2413.15s - 2414.15s |  And yeah.
2414.15s - 2418.15s |  So what's the nickname for the camp counselor?
2418.15s - 2419.15s |  Nutsack.
2419.15s - 2420.15s |  Nutsack.
2420.15s - 2421.15s |  Nutsack.
2423.15s - 2424.15s |  I have a funny story.
2424.15s - 2425.15s |  You're welcome.
2425.15s - 2426.15s |  You ask the question.
2426.15s - 2428.15s |  But there was someone lining up for a question.
2428.15s - 2436.90s |  Sure.
2439.90s - 2440.90s |  OK.
2440.90s - 2441.90s |  That happens a lot.
2442.90s - 2450.40s |  It's happening.
2450.40s - 2451.40s |  Oh, sorry.
2451.40s - 2455.16s |  What the hell is that?
2455.16s - 2456.16s |  I don't know what.
2456.16s - 2477.42s |  Happy to to direct you to our frequently asked questions on the CFP page where we go through what we're looking for for talks.
2477.42s - 2479.42s |  It seems like Grifter wants to say a few words.
2479.42s - 2480.42s |  So I have.
2480.42s - 2483.42s |  So so I have some advice on that as well.
2483.42s - 2484.42s |  You want chicken?
2485.42s - 2486.42s |  The thing about like so.
2486.42s - 2492.42s |  So I've served on multiple review boards for DEF CON, for Black Hat, other conferences as well.
2492.42s - 2500.42s |  And what is a pattern that I see is that people will do incredible research like they do this incredible research.
2500.42s - 2507.42s |  And then when they go to fill out the CFP submission, they will spend basically the bare minimum amount of time filling it out.
2507.42s - 2510.42s |  Like you've spent a year doing the research.
2510.42s - 2517.42s |  Put the time in to explain what it is you did and why it's important and why other people should hear about it.
2517.42s - 2525.42s |  Often, you know, the abstract will be confusing or the bio of the individual will be longer than the abstract.
2525.42s - 2527.42s |  The outline is not detailed.
2527.42s - 2529.42s |  When we say detailed, we mean detailed.
2529.42s - 2532.42s |  Show us what you're going to talk about at each stage of the talk.
2532.42s - 2537.42s |  If you have a slide for something, I want to see a breakdown of what's going to be on that slide.
2537.42s - 2538.42s |  What are you going to talk about?
2538.42s - 2539.42s |  So really, that's it.
2539.42s - 2549.42s |  If you put the time in to do all that research, take a fraction of that time to fill out the CFP and give us an idea of why it should come to the main stage.
2549.42s - 2554.68s |  Okay.
2554.68s - 2555.68s |  Grifter.
2555.68s - 2557.68s |  Actually, you know what?
2557.68s - 2560.68s |  You've gotten lots of questions.
2560.68s - 2562.68s |  You.
2562.68s - 2564.68s |  Do you have a pet?
2564.68s - 2565.68s |  What kind?
2565.68s - 2567.68s |  What's its name?
2567.68s - 2569.68s |  Its name is Grifter.
2569.68s - 2572.99s |  What's the funniest trick your pet can do?
2572.99s - 2576.99s |  This is a hard question because I don't have a pet other than Grifter.
2576.99s - 2577.99s |  Where did you grow up?
2577.99s - 2580.99s |  What was the street address of where you grew up?
2580.99s - 2582.99s |  Your mother's maiden name?
2582.99s - 2584.99s |  You didn't ask me my social.
2584.99s - 2587.99s |  The last four of your social.
2587.99s - 2590.99s |  I think we have another question.
2590.99s - 2591.99s |  Probably our last one.
2591.99s - 2592.99s |  Yeah.
2592.99s - 2614.86s |  I can't answer that in a minute.
2614.86s - 2616.86s |  Yeah, I definitely can't answer that either.
2616.86s - 2619.86s |  They're all long stories.
2619.86s - 2621.86s |  I like T-Rex fights.
2621.86s - 2622.86s |  T-Rex fights are fun.
2622.86s - 2623.86s |  T-Rex fights are good.
2623.86s - 2624.86s |  I've seen a T-Rex fight before.
2624.86s - 2625.86s |  Naked guy.
2625.86s - 2626.86s |  Naked guy.
2626.86s - 2627.86s |  Naked guy was super weird.
2627.86s - 2632.86s |  I found out recently how he became Naked Guy, so we should talk about that.
2632.86s - 2633.86s |  Yeah, I did too.
2633.86s - 2634.86s |  Trevor Forget.
2634.86s - 2636.86s |  Trevor Forget.
2636.86s - 2638.86s |  The cockroach that we had a whole thing about.
2638.86s - 2642.86s |  So the things we can't talk about, like to set a bar.
2642.86s - 2647.86s |  At DEFCON 11 on the scavenger hunt list, it said streak through Grifter's talk.
2647.86s - 2649.86s |  And there were three.
2649.86s - 2653.86s |  And one of them hugged me on stage.
2653.86s - 2655.86s |  And I'm willing to talk about that.
2655.86s - 2658.86s |  So you can imagine what we're going to talk about after this.
2658.86s - 2660.86s |  I really enjoyed the-
2660.86s - 2661.86s |  I think we'll need the couch.
2661.86s - 2666.86s |  He'll need to lay down and talk about his feelings.
2666.86s - 2671.86s |  I enjoyed that the chairs that we had with the beans in it,
2671.86s - 2673.86s |  that they had to figure out how to get them out.
2673.86s - 2677.86s |  They were like, one of the things you have to do for this contest
2677.86s - 2681.86s |  is figure out how to get the chairs out without anybody stopping you.
2681.86s - 2682.86s |  Yeah.
2682.86s - 2683.86s |  All right.
2683.86s - 2685.86s |  Well, that is it for us.
2685.86s - 2687.86s |  Oh, there's a question.
2687.86s - 2696.71s |  That was amazing.
2696.71s - 2697.71s |  Oh, you know what?
2697.71s - 2698.71s |  So good.
2698.71s - 2699.71s |  Seven seconds.
2699.71s - 2701.71s |  I was wrapping it up, sir.
2701.71s - 2702.71s |  So good.
2702.71s - 2703.71s |  Thank you.
2703.71s - 2706.34s |  Want a chicken?
2706.34s - 2707.34s |  Thanks.
