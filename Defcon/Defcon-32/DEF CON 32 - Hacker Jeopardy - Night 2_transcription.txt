2.64s - 6.64s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Ladies and gentlemen, Wayne Schwartau and Miss Kitty.
6.64s - 20.86s |  All right, it's second night and you showed up again. That was stupid.
20.86s - 25.86s |  We were hoping to get out of here by 8.30, but that's not going to fucking happen.
25.86s - 29.86s |  All right, hopefully you guys, I'm going to really do another shout out.
29.86s - 36.86s |  You guys have no idea how hard this crew of 14, 15 people,
36.86s - 41.86s |  how much work goes into actually making this thing look like it's easy.
41.86s - 47.86s |  It's fucking hard. Let's hear it, please, again for the entire DFI crew.
47.86s - 58.75s |  And yesterday I forgot entirely, my bad, to shout it out.
58.75s - 62.75s |  We used to have Beer Bettys, we used to have Vina Vandals,
62.75s - 65.75s |  and a few of you are out there who used to be up here.
65.75s - 70.75s |  But now we have the Lentile Lookalikes who are doing an awesome job.
70.75s - 78.81s |  Kitty, what do you want to say?
78.81s - 82.81s |  I want to say hi, thank you for coming to my birthday party.
82.81s - 89.17s |  Should I tell you guys my real age?
89.17s - 91.17s |  Shut up.
91.17s - 93.17s |  Fifty fucking five years old.
93.17s - 96.50s |  Let's hear it.
96.50s - 99.50s |  And fucking DEF CON always happens on my birthday,
99.50s - 103.50s |  so I always quietly spend my birthday with you guys.
103.50s - 105.50s |  But now you know. So there you go.
105.50s - 109.50s |  Anyway, I have three words for you.
109.50s - 129.97s |  No.
129.97s - 131.97s |  And there's a little surprise this evening.
131.97s - 135.97s |  We have a very, very special guest who has disappeared.
135.97s - 139.97s |  What the hell? It's a big surprise.
139.97s - 141.97s |  She was sitting down.
141.97s - 144.97s |  I want to introduce you to somebody who is very special,
144.97s - 147.97s |  somebody I've known for quite a few years,
147.97s - 149.97s |  and she's going to have a few words for you.
149.97s - 153.97s |  Please welcome, stand up with honor,
153.97s - 155.97s |  Kimberly Mitnick.
179.21s - 182.21s |  Who's this special person that you're talking about?
182.21s - 184.21s |  I'm like, where is this person?
184.21s - 188.21s |  No, I was always happily behind the curtains,
188.21s - 191.21s |  don't at all need any acknowledgement whatsoever,
191.21s - 193.21s |  but I just want to say to everyone in the community,
193.21s - 195.21s |  thank you for all the love, you know,
195.21s - 199.21s |  for the past year that everyone has given for Kevin.
199.21s - 202.21s |  Whether it's love and hate, let's be honest.
202.21s - 205.21s |  I admit, right, I see it, I acknowledge it,
205.21s - 207.21s |  but there's a lot of love,
207.21s - 209.21s |  and there's a few special shout-outs that I want to give,
209.21s - 211.21s |  especially to Dave Kennedy.
211.21s - 213.21s |  I really appreciate it.
213.21s - 216.21s |  I don't know if he's here, if he is here or not,
216.21s - 219.21s |  but he's done such amazing, just sharing the stories,
219.21s - 221.21s |  and I really appreciate everyone sharing those stories,
221.21s - 225.21s |  because, I mean, that's really what keeps Kevin alive,
225.21s - 229.21s |  and that's really important to me as well.
229.21s - 230.21s |  And I also want to...
230.21s - 233.21s |  There's actually a few of our Mitnick security team here,
233.21s - 236.21s |  and so, guys, raise your hands.
236.21s - 243.77s |  I'm going to keep this very short,
243.77s - 245.77s |  because I know it is very short,
245.77s - 248.77s |  but I do have some of Kevin's Lockpick business cards,
248.77s - 250.77s |  and I know that a few people wanted them,
250.77s - 252.77s |  and they still are in production.
252.77s - 253.77s |  Don't worry.
253.77s - 254.77s |  I'm happy to give them out.
254.77s - 255.77s |  You know, come meet me.
255.77s - 256.77s |  I'm here.
256.77s - 257.77s |  After.
257.77s - 258.77s |  Afterwards.
258.77s - 259.77s |  After.
259.77s - 260.77s |  Okay, after, after.
260.77s - 261.77s |  All right, thanks, everyone.
261.77s - 269.19s |  All right, Fizz, let's get this shit show on the road.
269.19s - 276.52s |  Hacker Jeopardy 30, let's rock it!
276.52s - 284.52s |  Acronym used for the U.S. Armed Forces five levels of alert.
284.52s - 285.52s |  What is DEFCON?
285.52s - 286.52s |  That's it.

398.57s - 401.57s |  for 30 fucking yearsâ€¦
426.15s - 427.15s |  Everything that's happened tonight.
427.15s - 430.75s |  one of my favorite nights of every year
430.75s - 432.51s |  because this is almost like church
432.51s - 434.95s |  where we get to talk about all the things
434.95s - 436.89s |  that have happened over the last year
436.89s - 439.45s |  and have a couple of moments of laughs together.
439.45s - 442.09s |  We've got three teams that are gonna do awesome tonight.
442.09s - 445.03s |  We've got special guests out the wazoo.

447.27s - 455.26s |  so let's have some good times, right?
455.26s - 457.76s |  Teams winning in game one,
457.76s - 460.86s |  bestowed in something that's really not amenable
460.86s - 463.22s |  to wearing in the Vegas heat.
463.22s - 490.82s |  They are.
490.82s - 492.74s |  Computer is your.
492.74s - 520.96s |  On this stage, more than all you motherfuckers
520.96s - 522.18s |  have put together.
522.18s - 537.36s |  They are.
537.36s - 539.16s |  With the very same machine.
540.72s - 542.88s |  Oh fuck yeah, we've got some teams.
542.88s - 544.32s |  Hey audience, are you ready?
544.32s - 552.89s |  I have to tie my shoe, hold on.
554.41s - 555.57s |  I'm good, thanks.
555.57s - 557.05s |  You fucking cocktease.
557.05s - 558.49s |  Let's fucking go.
558.49s - 559.41s |  Let's play.
559.41s - 569.84s |  It is my distinct pleasure to present to you
569.84s - 572.32s |  the categories for the first round tonight.
572.68s - 573.88s |  And they are.
573.88s - 591.37s |  General Nerdery edition.
591.37s - 599.92s |  Fucking sell out.
599.92s - 603.40s |  It's a first debut at the 30th anniversary.
603.40s - 608.71s |  We've got people here that are part of the DFIU clue group.
608.71s - 615.14s |  Cheer louder for them, you'll like to see them, I promise.
615.14s - 619.02s |  And finally, that's what she said.
623.51s - 626.75s |  Pandemonium, as you are closest to me,
626.75s - 630.63s |  you have an added benefit of picking the first category.
631.47s - 637.82s |  Audience, are we ready to play Hacker Jeopardy?
637.82s - 642.82s |  Let's get started with the DFIU clue crew for 100.
646.02s - 648.38s |  DFIU clue crew for 100.
648.38s - 650.22s |  I'm welcoming to the stage,
650.22s - 661.56s |  Helen of Tor from VX Underground.
661.56s - 662.76s |  Here we go.
662.76s - 666.28s |  At DEF CON 27, Hacker Jeopardy contestants
666.28s - 671.10s |  were asked to name the port that Telnet is on.
671.10s - 673.02s |  Yeah, if you were there, you know where I'm going with this.
673.02s - 675.82s |  Not only were they hilariously incorrect,
675.82s - 678.70s |  they skipped over the correct response.
678.70s - 682.02s |  These were the three incorrect ports answered.
683.82s - 686.81s |  Ooh.
686.81s - 688.81s |  The three incorrect ports answered
688.81s - 691.53s |  when guessed the Telnet, the origination of the meme.
691.53s - 694.16s |  What are they?
694.16s - 695.40s |  All right, well, guess what?
695.40s - 696.56s |  That was the hundred.
699.64s - 703.62s |  You fucked it up.
703.62s - 705.50s |  Going once.
705.50s - 706.94s |  This is going great already.
708.18s - 716.02s |  Going twice.
716.02s - 717.42s |  What is wrong?
718.54s - 720.26s |  I'm not calling on Gmark.
720.26s - 731.75s |  Right over here.
731.75s - 733.03s |  All right, well, this makes me feel great
733.03s - 734.43s |  about how this is gonna go.
735.83s - 737.79s |  All right, back to the board, Pandas.
737.79s - 740.15s |  Let's go with the clue crew for 200.
740.15s - 741.99s |  Clue crew for 200.
741.99s - 750.76s |  Welcome to the stage.
750.76s - 752.12s |  What's going on, DEF CON?
752.12s - 757.51s |  How are we doing?
757.51s - 761.03s |  If you hit the left jab at exactly 30 seconds,
761.03s - 763.35s |  you will instantly knock out this boxer
763.35s - 769.82s |  in the NES version of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out.
769.82s - 771.06s |  Don't worry, I'll wait.
771.06s - 775.43s |  This is fun for me.
775.43s - 777.90s |  You know what?
777.90s - 781.72s |  The audience, if this doesn't work.
781.72s - 782.56s |  I believe in you.
782.56s - 784.16s |  Going once.
784.16s - 801.90s |  Going twice.
801.90s - 811.46s |  We have the CDW.
811.46s - 812.90s |  Well, this is fun.
812.90s - 814.86s |  Where are you going next, Pandemonium?
815.90s - 820.26s |  Let's keep this train wreck going for 300.
820.26s - 823.38s |  For the $300 clue, I welcome to the stage,
823.38s - 834.60s |  John Hammond.
834.60s - 835.72s |  Ed Sharan?
835.72s - 836.56s |  Is that you?
836.56s - 838.16s |  Thanks, guys.
838.16s - 840.24s |  All right, hey, this is supposed to be a funny one,
840.24s - 843.04s |  so if you could get some audience interaction at the end,
843.04s - 845.36s |  I'd love for you to lean into the joke here.
845.36s - 847.60s |  This is the colloquial name
847.60s - 850.36s |  for an exponential denial-of-service attack
850.36s - 861.59s |  via XML parsers.
861.59s - 862.43s |  Yeah, you did.
862.43s - 863.79s |  I know I most did.
863.79s - 864.63s |  You didn't hit it.
864.63s - 865.47s |  We hit the one.
865.47s - 868.03s |  Did they fuck it up?
868.03s - 888.40s |  Did they fuck it up?
888.40s - 906.00s |  Fuck it, we'll do it in prod.
906.00s - 907.80s |  Can I do my job now, Dave?
908.76s - 910.60s |  It wasn't seen already.
910.60s - 911.60s |  Well, what now?
911.60s - 912.60s |  There's no team lit up.
912.60s - 917.33s |  What am I gonna do?
917.33s - 929.76s |  What is the billion laughs attack?
929.76s - 932.36s |  Somebody's obviously low on potassium.
932.36s - 936.44s |  Back to the board, OnlyLens.
936.44s - 938.48s |  Let's go for fucking sellouts for 100.
938.48s - 939.40s |  Oh, thank God.
940.92s - 942.52s |  Fucking sellouts for 100.
943.84s - 953.10s |  This company sold out one of its philosophies long...
953.10s - 954.10s |  Pandemonium.
955.14s - 956.98s |  Who is Google?
956.98s - 958.14s |  Who the fuck is Google?
958.94s - 962.47s |  It's correct.
962.47s - 964.43s |  People, that's who Google is.
964.43s - 968.72s |  Back to the board, Pandas.
968.72s - 969.64s |  For 200.
969.64s - 970.48s |  For two.
971.92s - 974.04s |  This fucking bullshit artist
974.04s - 978.08s |  sold the security awareness company to know before.
979.32s - 980.56s |  Pandemonium.
980.56s - 985.33s |  Who is Kevin Mitnick?
985.33s - 990.27s |  Is wrong.
990.27s - 995.49s |  Awkward.
995.49s - 997.21s |  She's right there.
998.33s - 1000.13s |  I sit in the social engineering village.
1000.13s - 1001.49s |  We're all bullshit artists.
1001.49s - 1002.61s |  That's a compliment.
1002.61s - 1003.77s |  We know.
1008.70s - 1010.06s |  Going once.
1010.06s - 1011.38s |  This is so funny to me.
1011.38s - 1013.10s |  Going twice.
1013.10s - 1013.94s |  I don't care.
1013.94s - 1015.10s |  This is my favorite moment so far.
1015.10s - 1028.50s |  Out to the audience.
1028.50s - 1029.78s |  Who is Gregory D. Evans?
1029.78s - 1040.37s |  Is wrong.
1040.37s - 1042.41s |  Yep, nope, that's the favorite one so far.
1042.41s - 1043.45s |  Back to the board.
1043.45s - 1054.42s |  Pandas, you are in the hole.
1054.42s - 1058.76s |  Grifter, are you fucking serious?
1058.76s - 1061.96s |  I'm sorry, but if those of you in the front didn't hear that
1061.96s - 1065.00s |  and those in the back definitely didn't hear that,
1065.00s - 1067.56s |  my beautiful, beautiful Frank Grifter
1068.44s - 1071.16s |  just told me that Jeff Moss just texted him
1071.16s - 1073.76s |  and said that the outcome of this match
1073.76s - 1083.32s |  is now a black badge event.
1083.32s - 1101.78s |  I'm sorry, I've got tango.
1101.78s - 1102.62s |  Away from them.
1102.62s - 1103.90s |  I'll convince Jeff not to give it to you
1103.90s - 1105.66s |  if you don't fucking do great.
1105.66s - 1107.02s |  Let's go back to the board.
1107.02s - 1109.02s |  Pandemonium, here we go.
1109.02s - 1109.94s |  For 300.
1109.94s - 1126.63s |  For three.
1126.63s - 1129.99s |  You can wager any or all of up to 500 points.
1129.99s - 1135.50s |  Audience, how much should they wager?
1135.50s - 1137.06s |  Go big or go home, 500.
1137.06s - 1144.60s |  Fucking sellouts.
1144.60s - 1147.96s |  This colorful character sold his software company in 1994
1147.96s - 1150.56s |  and once claimed he was arrested in Norway
1150.56s - 1160.67s |  for using a thong for a face mask during COVID.
1160.67s - 1162.79s |  I love, I'm loving the audience murmur.

1579.75s - 1580.63s |  it's my fault.

2269.14s - 2272.02s |  Training pays off because you've hit the daily double.
2272.02s - 2274.10s |  Are you gonna wager any or all of it?
2274.10s - 2281.53s |  Alpha Lima Lima.

2302.38s - 2303.58s |  This guy's from the army.
2303.58s - 2305.74s |  That guy knows shit, he's on my team.

2312.70s - 2321.01s |  The only Canadian province represented in the NATO effort.
2321.01s - 2322.17s |  What is Quebec?
2322.17s - 2329.57s |  What is Quebec is correct.
2329.57s - 2330.81s |  Two categories left.
2330.81s - 2332.01s |  Where are we going next?
2333.05s - 2335.09s |  Let's fuck it up for 400 in the DFIU clue crew.

2340.05s - 2341.17s |  Whitney Merrill.
2341.17s - 2348.24s |  I hope you're having a good time.
2348.24s - 2353.24s |  So this boozy company's CEO was held individually liable
2354.24s - 2357.48s |  by the FTC, forcing security programs
2357.48s - 2360.68s |  at all of his companies, including the future ones,
2360.68s - 2365.68s |  with more than 25,000 clients after a 2020 breach
2366.08s - 2374.70s |  that exposed 2.5 million.
2374.70s - 2377.58s |  There's a guy that has a boozy company
2377.58s - 2382.10s |  who is held individually liable for a data breach.
2382.10s - 2389.50s |  What is that boozy company?
2389.50s - 2392.14s |  What is Booz Allen Hamilton?
2394.38s - 2401.11s |  That is wrong.
2401.11s - 2403.15s |  You gotta get a Snowden in here or there.
2404.63s - 2422.43s |  Going one.
2422.43s - 2423.63s |  Drizzly was the answer,
2423.63s - 2429.29s |  because it went on the board, calm your shit.
2429.29s - 2430.77s |  For 500, please.

2437.97s - 2444.70s |  Allie!
2444.70s - 2447.70s |  Apparently this is the easier of my two questions.
2448.74s - 2451.82s |  Did you know the string, give me a second,
2451.86s - 2456.86s |  A-W-A-V-A-U-T-S-H, and similar,
2458.30s - 2462.30s |  are found in the x86, Mac, and Linux binaries,
2462.30s - 2465.18s |  primarily because the opcode for this instruction
2465.18s - 2468.94s |  is O-X-41-HEX-41.
2468.94s - 2469.78s |  Good luck.
2469.78s - 2473.53s |  Can we get that all in NATO again?
2473.53s - 2474.53s |  Okay, here we go.
2475.49s - 2484.74s |  A-A-U-T-S-H.
2484.74s - 2487.38s |  This is the easier of my two questions.
2487.42s - 2489.46s |  Well then, you're fired.
2489.46s - 2490.74s |  Okay, thank you.

2492.58s - 2493.42s |  No.
2493.42s - 2495.06s |  No, I'm sorry, that's incorrect.
2498.25s - 2500.97s |  Listen, I really tried, I wanted to give a challenge.
2500.97s - 2503.93s |  Going once.
2503.93s - 2504.77s |  Going twice.
2504.77s - 2507.01s |  They need the question again, should I do it one more time?
2507.01s - 2510.61s |  Did you know the string,
2510.61s - 2521.90s |  A-W-A-V-A,
2521.90s - 2526.90s |  in the x64, Mac, and Linux binaries,
2528.30s - 2531.78s |  primarily because the opcode,
2532.82s - 2537.82s |  the opcode for this instruction is O-X-41.
2540.46s - 2542.54s |  Somebody please, and there is someone in the audience,
2542.54s - 2543.82s |  there's a couple people in the audience.
2543.82s - 2545.46s |  No, there's some nerds out there for sure.
2545.46s - 2546.30s |  There are nerds.
2546.30s - 2547.22s |  There's certainly nerds out there,
2547.22s - 2548.46s |  we're not just out here.
2548.46s - 2549.30s |  I need this guy.
2549.30s - 2550.78s |  Going once.
2550.78s - 2551.74s |  Going twice.
2552.58s - 2553.62s |  Oh, we'll give away some good shit for this.
2553.62s - 2555.70s |  We're gonna give away a Flipper Zero
2555.70s - 2557.50s |  from Sprocket Security.
2557.50s - 2559.54s |  That guy in the white mask.
2559.54s - 2561.30s |  No, no.
2561.30s - 2562.14s |  Right here.
2562.14s - 2563.18s |  What is yes?
2563.18s - 2564.02s |  No.
2565.46s - 2566.70s |  This is a hard one.
2566.70s - 2572.54s |  This is why it's 500.
2572.54s - 2589.67s |  Your wife is literally pointing to someone.
2589.67s - 2592.19s |  Glad we have some reverse engineers in the crowd.
2594.47s - 2596.59s |  All right, back to the board, pandas.
2597.91s - 2599.19s |  For 100.
2599.87s - 2600.71s |  For 100.

2609.95s - 2611.23s |  Wait, what?
2611.23s - 2613.19s |  You don't remember the category that you just said?
2613.19s - 2614.03s |  No.
2614.03s - 2615.31s |  Fuck no.

2668.45s - 2670.41s |  See, there's gonna be a thing in these lists
2670.41s - 2672.41s |  that doesn't belong, and you have to say,
2672.41s - 2677.85s |  um, actually, that doesn't belong.
2677.85s - 2679.61s |  Gotta explain all this shit to these people.
2679.61s - 2680.77s |  Back to the board.
2682.01s - 2683.89s |  I guess for 200.

4007.57s - 4008.61s |  Pandemonium.
4008.61s - 4010.37s |  What is Windows 3.1?
4010.37s - 4012.05s |  What is 3.1 is correct.

4026.98s - 4029.42s |  The singularity is near by this offer
4029.42s - 4031.06s |  pauses the point in time
4031.06s - 4032.98s |  where technological growth and innovation
4032.98s - 4036.22s |  becomes irreversible and potentially malicious.
4036.22s - 4037.46s |  Sounds like fucking no.
4040.58s - 4041.78s |  You guys fucking read?
4042.74s - 4044.66s |  The singularity is near.
4044.66s - 4045.50s |  It's near.

4084.74s - 4086.38s |  Pandemonium, you're in the lead.
4086.38s - 4087.78s |  Fishing for a thousand.
4087.78s - 4089.26s |  Fishing for a thousand.
4090.54s - 4093.38s |  This technique makes use of slightly misspelled websites
4093.38s - 4095.02s |  to trick users into thinking
4095.02s - 4097.46s |  they are visiting a legitimate domain.
4097.46s - 4098.58s |  Stepmoms.
4098.58s - 4100.06s |  What is domain squatting?
4101.14s - 4102.30s |  I'm gonna give that to you.
4102.30s - 4107.25s |  Type of squatting or domain squatting is correct.
4107.25s - 4108.09s |  Fuck off.

4109.49s - 4111.61s |  You fucked it up.
4112.33s - 4113.65s |  I don't care what you're saying right now.
4113.65s - 4115.49s |  It's correct.

4116.33s - 4117.29s |  Oh, are you disappointed in Vegas?
4117.29s - 4118.77s |  Fuck off.

4139.98s - 4141.62s |  I would welcome to the stage,
4141.62s - 4154.10s |  to read this category, Kimberly Mitnick.
4154.10s - 4155.58s |  I do wanna clarify,
4155.58s - 4158.70s |  I am actually not the daughter of Kevin, okay?
4159.74s - 4162.70s |  There has been quite a few people messaging me on LinkedIn
4162.70s - 4164.46s |  and a few other places on X.
4164.46s - 4165.82s |  I am actually the wife, okay?
4165.82s - 4166.98s |  There was an age gap.
4168.62s - 4169.94s |  I had to say that
4169.94s - 4171.90s |  because there's been a lot of people messaging me going,
4171.90s - 4174.58s |  I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your father.
4174.58s - 4176.78s |  He was not my father.
4176.78s - 4178.02s |  I'm putting it out there.
4185.00s - 4185.84s |  Here we go.
4185.84s - 4186.68s |  We're at three?

4190.04s - 4191.48s |  Okay.
4191.48s - 4194.56s |  After he was freed, free Kevin,
4194.56s - 4199.94s |  stickers were replaced with these.
4199.94s - 4201.78s |  What has put Kevin back?
4201.78s - 4216.45s |  What has put Kevin back is unfortunately correct.
4216.45s - 4218.57s |  Back to the board, sir, sir, sir, sir.
4218.57s - 4219.41s |  Back to the board.

4280.21s - 4281.25s |  For six.
4283.33s - 4285.17s |  During his prosecution,
4285.17s - 4288.69s |  Kevin was accused of being able to whistle modem codes
4288.69s - 4291.13s |  that could cause a catastrophic event.
4292.25s - 4293.69s |  Panamonium.
4293.69s - 4297.21s |  What is the nuclear launch codes?

4311.94s - 4312.78s |  Oh, sorry.
4312.78s - 4315.78s |  Kevin Mitnick for 400.
4315.78s - 4318.46s |  This book was published in 2012
4318.46s - 4319.58s |  and was subtitled,

4355.20s - 4356.04s |  I have an idea,
4356.04s - 4356.88s |  but I'm not gonna say it.
4356.88s - 4366.28s |  Going twice.
4366.28s - 4379.22s |  Hey, this one's to the audience.
4379.22s - 4380.06s |  You rock.
4380.98s - 4384.79s |  You fucking rock.
4384.79s - 4386.19s |  That was too fucking many.
4387.31s - 4388.63s |  I just wanna say,

4400.56s - 4401.72s |  We've got answer.
4401.72s - 4403.52s |  We got three clues left.
4403.52s - 4407.75s |  Stepmom, you're in control of the board.
4407.75s - 4409.71s |  Win GPT for 200, please.
4409.71s - 4425.76s |  Win GPT for 200.
4426.60s - 4427.44s |  Crucial moment here,
4427.44s - 4430.16s |  because this could change the outcome of the game.
4430.16s - 4432.52s |  1,400 points is how much you wager,
4432.52s - 4433.76s |  or you can wager.
4433.76s - 4436.40s |  How much are you going to wager, Stepmoms?
4436.40s - 4438.00s |  How much can I wager?
4438.00s - 4439.88s |  Up to 1,400.
4439.88s - 4442.16s |  How much do we get in alimony?
4442.16s - 4443.64s |  Not enough.
4443.64s - 4446.06s |  True.
4446.06s - 4454.01s |  200.
4454.01s - 4465.68s |  Here, 1,400.
4465.68s - 4469.64s |  Your score for 2,800 or nothing at all.
4469.64s - 4476.20s |  Here is this well-constructed win GPT clue.
4476.20s - 4479.60s |  What a randomizer.
4479.60s - 4482.84s |  Wow, that would be number five,
4482.84s - 4486.52s |  or it began at seven,
4486.52s - 4488.16s |  and I forget when they put the tent up
4488.16s - 4490.72s |  and blew up the air conditioning,
4490.72s - 4498.14s |  but then there was pool three.
4498.14s - 4499.10s |  Play it again.
4500.34s - 4502.30s |  What is the Alexis Park?
4502.30s - 4517.26s |  What?
4517.26s - 4518.10s |  I can't hear pool three
4518.10s - 4520.94s |  without feeling very weird things inside my body.
4521.90s - 4523.02s |  Back to the board.
4523.02s - 4524.94s |  Well, that's because I was in, nevermind.
4524.94s - 4527.06s |  Back to the board, Stepmom.
4527.06s - 4528.74s |  I have to pee, so 400, please.
4529.78s - 4530.82s |  That doesn't make sense.
4530.82s - 4533.18s |  Back to the singularity for 400.
4533.18s - 4535.86s |  Google's foray into computing with chat GPT
4535.86s - 4539.86s |  led to people thinking that this zodiacal,
4539.86s - 4541.22s |  zodiacal?
4541.22s - 4544.14s |  Zodiacal chatbot was too woke.
4545.58s - 4546.58s |  Oly lands.
4546.58s - 4547.54s |  Who is Gemini?
4547.54s - 4549.10s |  Who is Gemini is correct,
4549.10s - 4553.08s |  and for the last clue on the board.
4554.36s - 4556.72s |  This computer system played an actual Jeopardy
4556.72s - 4559.24s |  and won decisively in its first match
4559.24s - 4561.00s |  against the like of Ken Jennings.
4562.00s - 4563.76s |  Oly lands.
4563.76s - 4564.88s |  Who is Watson?
4564.88s - 4567.04s |  Who is IBM's Watson?
4567.04s - 4569.76s |  Is awkward that you got that right,
4569.76s - 4573.29s |  but that's correct.
4573.29s - 4574.13s |  All right.
4575.29s - 4578.81s |  Hey, audience, thank you for sticking with all the bullshit.
4578.81s - 4582.21s |  Are we ready for final hacker Jeopardy?
4582.25s - 4589.10s |  Are we ready?
4589.10s - 4601.06s |  The likes who are gonna count up the beer.
4601.06s - 4608.69s |  Finish it now.
4608.69s - 4610.01s |  We got 15 locked in.
4611.29s - 4613.53s |  All right, pandemonium, 15 beers,
4613.53s - 4620.75s |  taking them to 5,300 points.
4620.75s - 4623.24s |  16.
4623.24s - 4626.31s |  Stepmom?
4626.31s - 4630.91s |  Well, my stepmom drank 20 beers,
4630.91s - 4633.63s |  taking them to 4,800 points.
4635.19s - 4638.78s |  Oly lands.
4638.78s - 4641.30s |  While everybody else was going to take a tinkle
4641.30s - 4643.10s |  during the round change,
4643.10s - 4644.70s |  they stayed here and drank beers,
4644.70s - 4648.26s |  which brought them also with 20 beers,
4648.26s - 4653.26s |  taking them into the lead with 5,700 points.
4666.49s - 4668.61s |  The scores are locked in.
4669.53s - 4671.41s |  Have we distributed the papers?
4671.41s - 4675.02s |  We're all doing it all.
4675.02s - 4676.26s |  We're giving people cards.
4679.25s - 4680.57s |  All right.
4680.57s - 4683.37s |  Well, as you know, final hacker Jeopardy
4683.37s - 4685.25s |  is going to come down to one category,
4685.25s - 4686.73s |  one category alone.
4687.61s - 4690.29s |  Where these teams can wager any or all of their points.
4691.45s - 4692.61s |  For the black badge,
4692.61s - 4696.57s |  consider your wagers remarkably carefully.
4696.57s - 4700.41s |  This is for lifetime admission to DEF CON,
4700.41s - 4704.77s |  which by the year 2050 is gonna be about $15,000.
4707.38s - 4712.38s |  Your final, final black badge hacker Jeopardy category is
4714.14s - 4719.52s |  Dante's Inferno.
4719.56s - 4727.54s |  You can wager any or all of your points.
4727.54s - 4728.50s |  While they're wagering,
4728.50s - 4730.42s |  I just want to give a shout out
4730.42s - 4732.70s |  to all of the other people on this team
4732.70s - 4737.02s |  that worked remarkably hard.
4737.02s - 4740.02s |  Make me only look like kind of a dumb ass
4740.02s - 4747.82s |  when I'm standing behind this podium.
4747.82s - 4750.18s |  Everyone, the wagers are locked in.
4750.18s - 4752.06s |  It's time for our final clue.
4752.98s - 4754.18s |  And it is.
4756.18s - 4760.26s |  The seven layers of the OSI networking model
4761.10s - 4764.14s |  in correct reverse alphabetical order.
4764.14s - 4766.82s |  You have 60 seconds.
4766.82s - 4832.42s |  Good luck.
4832.42s - 4834.10s |  Pens down, lift tile, lookalikes,
4834.10s - 4865.02s |  please take away their papers.
4865.02s - 4866.62s |  Actually, I have a thing that I want to do
4866.62s - 4868.38s |  before we reveal any of the answers,
4868.38s - 4871.34s |  which is I have one more big prize to give away.
4872.74s - 4875.94s |  This is a Sparrow Challenge Vault,
4875.94s - 4879.46s |  which is the lock picking safe cracking.
4879.58s - 4880.42s |  Please.
4881.54s - 4882.94s |  I don't like that at all.
4883.82s - 4886.82s |  And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give you one chance,
4886.82s - 4888.10s |  one person from the audience,
4888.10s - 4890.34s |  one chance to come up and stand by me.
4890.34s - 4892.86s |  If you know that you know this,
4892.86s - 4894.02s |  come right here for it.
4894.02s - 4895.34s |  Are you ready?
4895.34s - 4896.74s |  But you're gonna endure the audience.
4896.74s - 4899.58s |  And audience, if they fuck it up,
4899.58s - 4901.98s |  I need you to let them hear it worse than anything
4901.98s - 4904.82s |  you've ever given to a contestant.
4904.82s - 4905.98s |  All right, come on.
4905.98s - 4914.44s |  Come on.
4915.20s - 4916.04s |  All right.
4916.04s - 4921.67s |  Yeah, what is transport, session, presentation,
4921.67s - 4945.16s |  physical, network, data link, application?
4945.16s - 4947.84s |  Well, let's see if they got it fucking right.
4947.84s - 4951.00s |  First and foremost, we're gonna go to Stepmom.
4951.00s - 4952.00s |  I tried, man.
4952.00s - 4954.28s |  As you are a third place team.
4954.28s - 4955.12s |  Really?
4956.20s - 4958.32s |  Yeah, apparently you didn't drink enough beer
4958.32s - 4962.13s |  as designated beer drinker.
4962.13s - 4966.69s |  Your answer was je ne give a fuck pas
4966.69s - 4968.61s |  just like your Stepmom.
4976.59s - 4979.23s |  Oh my God, I feel like Dude Perfect right now.
4979.23s - 4981.55s |  Lentile wins.
4981.55s - 4986.03s |  And their wager was no actual points.
4986.03s - 4987.19s |  Zero.
4987.19s - 4988.59s |  So they remain.
4988.59s - 4996.19s |  You's a fucking rat.
4996.19s - 5000.58s |  And they said transport, session,
5000.58s - 5005.58s |  presentation, physical, network, data, and application,
5006.42s - 5007.66s |  which is the right order,
5007.70s - 5016.55s |  but it's not in the form of a question.
5016.55s - 5019.23s |  Epic fail you could have imagined.
5019.23s - 5035.41s |  God, this is so exciting.
5038.47s - 5040.59s |  And it comes down to this.
5041.75s - 5044.47s |  Only Lands, who was in the lead the whole time,
5044.47s - 5047.87s |  pretty much, for 5,700.
5047.87s - 5049.55s |  That's a fucking lie.
5049.55s - 5051.27s |  And before I read their answer,
5051.27s - 5053.15s |  I'm gonna tell you what they wagered.
5054.51s - 5055.87s |  They wagered, hold on.
5055.87s - 5058.39s |  Now somebody, give me one of those goon photographers.
5058.39s - 5060.15s |  Take a picture of this shit.
5060.15s - 5066.15s |  They wagered 5,700, all of it.
5066.15s - 5069.31s |  So they either have one of the highest scores
5069.31s - 5071.07s |  in Hacker Jeopardy history,
5071.07s - 5074.83s |  or they have pissed away the chance for a black match
5074.83s - 5081.85s |  into the wind, just like the Vegas Scirocco wins.
5081.85s - 5087.58s |  The fucking question says reverse.
5087.58s - 5093.80s |  Does that make you excited for what I'm going to read?
5093.80s - 5100.30s |  Said what is application, data link, network, physical,
5100.78s - 5140.54s |  presentation, said the truth.
5140.54s - 5142.10s |  Fuck every last one of you.
5143.58s - 5148.64s |  My name is Lin Trial, and here's what I want you,
5148.64s - 5152.76s |  until we meet again in this space next year,
5152.76s - 5155.48s |  be fucking excellent to each other.
5155.48s - 5156.32s |  I love you all.
