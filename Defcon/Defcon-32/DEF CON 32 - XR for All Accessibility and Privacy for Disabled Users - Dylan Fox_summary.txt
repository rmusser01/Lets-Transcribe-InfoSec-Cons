**Introduction to XR and Accessibility**

- **Extended Reality (XR)** technologies offer possibilities for socializing, entertainment, and training.
- **Disabled users** often face exclusion or privacy risks with XR.
- **Dylan Fox** is the Director of Operations for the XR Access Initiative at Cornell Tech.
- **Core challenges**: Accessibility and privacy for disabled users in XR.

**XR Access Initiative**

- Community dedicated to making virtual, augmented, and mixed reality accessible for people with disabilities.
- Founded in **2019** as a community group, now a research initiative of Cornell Tech.
- Provides resources to designers and developers for making apps accessible.
- Connects different communities including technical platforms, content creators, researchers, government, and advocates.
- **XR Access Symposium**: Annual event with videos available on YouTube.

**Understanding XR Accessibility**

- **XR**: Umbrella term for extended reality, including virtual, augmented, and mixed reality.
- **Accessibility**: Not a checklist but affects everyone; ensures usability regardless of abilities.
- **Temporary ability**: Concept that everyone can experience disability at some point in life.
- **Core platform accessibility**: All XR apps should be accessible to anyone.
- **XR as assistive technology**: Tools aimed at supporting people with disabilities.

**Privacy and Accessibility Tensions in XR**

- **Facial recognition**: Useful for people with memory problems but poses privacy risks.
- **Assistive technology**: Offers independence but raises concerns about who accesses the data.
- **Non-consensual recording**: Risks with facial recognition and 3D mapping without consent.
- **Data retention**: Concerns about data being stored indefinitely or exposed in breaches.
- **Perception hacking**: Risks of altering perceptions through hacked headsets.

**Balancing Accessibility and Privacy**

- **On-device processing**: Minimizes data sent to the cloud, enhancing privacy.
- **Data transparency and control**: Users should know what data is collected and have control over it.
- **Consent**: Essential for protecting privacy, exploring feasible methods for obtaining it.

**Conclusion and Call to Action**

- **XR accessibility and privacy**: Vital topics for future tech development.
- **Collaboration needed**: Involvement from tech companies, legislators, watchdogs, and the disabled community.
