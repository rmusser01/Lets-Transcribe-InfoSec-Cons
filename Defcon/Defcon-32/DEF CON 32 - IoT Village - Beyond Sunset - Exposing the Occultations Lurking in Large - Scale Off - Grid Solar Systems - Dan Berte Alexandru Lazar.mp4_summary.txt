**Introduction**
- The speakers are **vulnerability researchers** at **Bitdefender**.
- They have published over **25 high-profile cases** and dozens of **white papers**.

**Context**
- **Cyber-security** is often not seen as a significant concern for the **power grid**, with most disruptions attributed to natural causes (e.g., **squirrels**, fires).
- The grid is highly **regulated** and **protected**.
- However, with the rise of **green energy**, the landscape is changing, and **solar** is gaining prominence.

**Solar Energy's Rise**
- In **2021**, over **500 gigawatts** of solar capacity were added globally.
- This explosive growth brings increased attention from potential attackers.
- The question arises: Is security keeping up?

**Investigation of Solar Platforms**
- The researchers investigated a manufacturer called **Deye** and a measurement platform called **SolarMan**.
- These are **smart systems** that can be controlled remotely.
- They discovered vulnerabilities that could impact **over 3.5 million users** and **300,000 businesses**.

**Vulnerabilities and Exploits**
- **Man-in-the-middle attack** on the Deye cloud app using only the user certificate.
- Hard-coded credentials found in login requests.
- Access to an account with information on user devices, including model, version, and password.
- **SSID** of the access point follows a convenient naming scheme, starting with "P" and the **serial number**.
- By obtaining the serial number, an attacker can access the access point and profit.
- A search API returns data on all users and organizations, including emails, phone numbers, and addresses.
- A token from SolarMan gives access to an account with a different user ID, allowing takeover of over **1 million accounts**.
- By changing the user ID and email in the token, an attacker can gain access to any account without signature checks or errors.
- This impacts all **3.5 million accounts**, which were at risk of takeover.

**Vendor Response and Impact**
- The vendors fixed the vulnerabilities within **24 hours** of being contacted.
- The impacted vendors are inferred and include those sharing the SolarMan platform and potentially the same database.
- Over **3.5 million users** and **330,000 businesses** could have been impacted.
- Access to user information (PII) and control of inverters could overload or underload the grid.
- The platform serves about a **fifth of the world's total solar generation capacity**.
- The researchers question if this changes the conversation around grid security and if it warrants more attention.

**Timeline and Conclusion**
- The vendors were contacted in **mid-May** and were responsive in acknowledging and fixing the vulnerabilities.
- The researchers encourage vendors to appoint a permanent contact for vulnerability findings and set up a disclosure program with a PGP key.
- They invite attendees to visit their table at the **IT village** and participate in a challenge to hack a TV.
