**Introduction**
- Speaker: Seunghee Han, first-time presenter at DEF CON
- **Title of talk:** UDS on CAN attacks, discovering safety critical risks by fuzzing
- Focus: Weak points in latest EV models identified through fuzzing tests

**AutoCrypt and Vehicle Security**
- **AutoCrypt:** Mobility security company focusing on vehicle security
- **WP.29 2020 regulations:** Require car makers to obtain CSMS certification
- Collaboration with OEMs and tier suppliers for fuzzing tests

**Fuzzing Tests and Findings**
- **Fuzzing:** Testing method using random or unusual data to identify system vulnerabilities
- **Findings:** Strange behaviors in vehicles, such as stopping or non-movement

**Understanding UDS**
- **UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services):** Protocol for vehicle communication, defined in ISO 14229
- **Function:** Used in diagnostics to identify vehicle issues
- **Security measures:** Designed to restrict access to UDS services

**Attack Scenarios**
- **ECU Reset Service:** Used for troubleshooting; can stop vehicle's engine
  - **Scenario 1:** Sudden stop by sending ECU reset message to moving vehicle
  - **Scenario 2:** Vehicle disabling through continuous ECU reset messages
- **Root Cause:** ECU reset not disabled in drive mode, against ISO 14229 guidelines

**Communication Control Service**
- **Function:** Controls communication functions of the ECU
- **Strange Behaviors:** Caused by sub-functions that enable or disable RX/TX
- **Scenarios:** 
  - **Brief Pause and Sudden Movement:** Vehicle pauses before moving
  - **Vehicle Disabling:** Continuous messages disable vehicle functions
- **Root Cause:** Communication control not disabled in drive mode, no security authentication required

**Attack Methods**
- **Access Methods:** 
  - Unauthorized entry to vehicle to connect wireless OBD device
  - Remote attacks using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
- **Vulnerability:** Vehicles without security measures are at risk

**Countermeasures**
- **Important Services:** Operate only in not ready state (engine off)
- **Security Access:** Requires authorization for ECU reset and communication control
  - **Security Access Service:** Uses seed and key for authentication
  - **Gateway Safety Function:** Filters data to allow access only to certain information

**Conclusion and Recommendations**
- **Summary:** Diagnostic services can impact vehicle safety; essential to secure them
- **Final Note:** Importance of security for diagnostic services to prevent accidents
