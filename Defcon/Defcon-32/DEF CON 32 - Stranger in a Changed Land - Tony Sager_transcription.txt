  "title": "DEF CON 32 - Stranger in a Changed Land  - Tony Sager",
  "description": "What's it like to spend a career as a cyberdefender for the DoD and the nation, but homed inside of an intelligence agency? In this talk, I'll offer a historical and personal perspective based on 35 years at the National Security Agency as a vulnerability analyst for the defense, from junior analyst to executive manager. The common element across my career was the search for vulnerabilities in the name of defense - finding them, making sense of them, leading organizations to find them, and then translating that knowledge into action to prevent or manage them. I'll share lessons learned as cyberdefense evolved from a focus on mathematics and cryptography to systems and software; and from government security to a global internet. And we'll focus on the mission, technical, and cultural interplay of cyberdefense and offense/intelligence as it played out at NSA. War stories, culture clashes, bureaucratic mazes? Of course! But in the end, better security for all.\n\nCommunications Security, Computer Security, Information Security, Information Assurance, Defensive Information Operations, and several more - I'm very lucky to have ridden the World-Wide Wave we now call cybersecurity.\n\nAnd I am very proud to have spent 35 years in Federal Service at the National Security Agency as part of the Information Assurance mission. The common element across my career was the search for vulnerabilities in the name of defense - finding vulnerabilities, making sense of them, leading organizations to find them, and then translating that knowledge into action to prevent or manage them.\n\nThat final challenge consumed the last third of my government career. How can we translate what we learn through product testing, Red Teams, Blue Teams, systems analysis, etc. into operational guidance, best practices, requirements, training, and security improvements? How can we bridge the gap between telling people what they are doing wrong, and helping them do what's right? This led to projects like the release of NSA Security Guides to the public (www.nsa.gov), involvement in open standards for security automation and information sharing, and an activity now known as the Critical Security Controls.\n\nSince retirement in 2012, I have been able to continue to serve the cause of cyber defense through our work at the non-profit Center for Internet Security, and the Council on CyberSecurity before that. And I am very active in more volunteer cybersecurity causes than I can recall.",

0.98s - 5.98s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 network-adjusted timing device here, it's 530. So welcome. Welcome to this talk. So I am
11.36s - 15.70s |  Tony Sager. Uh, thank you for, thank you for being here. I'm really honored by your
15.70s - 21.90s |  presence. So, uh, my first DEF CON was in 2007. I know at this point in the day, right, your
21.90s - 26.90s |  brains are full, your stomachs are empty, your thirst is like up here, you're getting tired. So
27.16s - 34.10s |  I really appreciate that you'll spend the day, the end of your day here with me. And, um, it's a
34.10s - 37.70s |  little bit of a different kind of a talk. And when Jeff Moss said they had this war stories
37.70s - 42.68s |  track, I couldn't resist. Because my whole life is about stories. You're looking at a guy,
42.68s - 47.18s |  I, I've just passed, uh, 47 years plus now in cyber security. Except we didn't call it
47.18s - 52.18s |  cyber security back then. So, my purpose today, yes, yes I have survived. Oh, so I'll have to
52.44s - 57.44s |  tell you a story, right? Nobody survives for decades in cyber defense unless you're one of
60.28s - 65.28s |  two personality types. Complete hopeless optimist or complete cynic. And both personality
68.08s - 72.32s |  types have all the data they need to convince themselves they are right. Right? If you
72.32s - 78.26s |  want to see misery, if you're negative and you're thinking every day there's a disaster, you
78.28s - 84.42s |  can point to it and say, see, I am right. If you're a hopeless optimist, guess what? I am.
84.42s - 89.26s |  There's always reason to hope. Because there's great technology, great people, great
89.26s - 94.50s |  opportunities to share. And that's why we're here today. So 2007, I was honored to be a
94.50s - 99.60s |  keynote at both Black Hat and DEF CON. And that was a big step. I was employed by the
99.60s - 104.78s |  National Security Agency, remember? NSA, never say anything, that place. And I came out
104.80s - 110.10s |  here and I'm sure I was by far the most senior technical manager ever to publicly be
110.10s - 115.44s |  identified as one and speak at an event like this. But it was a bit of a coming out party. I
115.44s - 118.88s |  was, I came out here not with the standard government message, right? I'm with the
118.88s - 124.92s |  government, I'm here to help you. I came out with a message, we are part of your community.
124.92s - 131.20s |  And we bring gifts, we bring presents, we bring content. So in 2001, I led the campaign to
131.22s - 137.76s |  release NSA security guidance to the public through NSA.gov. That was a culture breaker at
137.76s - 143.50s |  NSA. It took a lot of convincing to do that. But I was, I was trying to make a statement
143.50s - 148.80s |  from inside NSA. We are part of the community and we are connected and we don't get better
148.80s - 153.44s |  until we help each other get better. And I really believed in that. So that's why I came out
153.44s - 157.88s |  here in 2007. So as I approached the twilight of my career, and if you didn't hear the early
157.90s - 163.06s |  jokes, it was about, uh, maybe this is the last time for me. Um, it's a chance for me to
163.06s - 168.54s |  close the loop on my thinking, to come back to this place here to reinforce that the role of
168.54s - 171.98s |  that, uh, it's, it's more than a bumper sticker. We really do have to work together in a
171.98s - 176.02s |  really complex situation. So let me just give you a little, uh, short background. This is
176.02s - 180.72s |  the one slide I used to illustrate, uh, 47 years plus in cyber security. I started in the
180.72s - 186.76s |  lower left. ComSec, anyone remember that? Communication security. I had no idea what I
186.78s - 192.04s |  was doing. I had no idea what the career field was. I applied to NSA because I bumped into
192.04s - 195.68s |  somebody said, did you ever think about working at NSA? I said, what do they do? I don't know,
195.68s - 202.26s |  but they hire mathematicians. I'm in, let me apply. I applied. I took the hardest math test
202.26s - 207.80s |  in my life. I must've done okay. They brought me in for processing. I went through all the
207.80s - 212.06s |  background stuff. Many of you know what that's like. I took a polygraph test, the worst
212.06s - 218.14s |  hour of my life. I did so well though, they invited me back again to try again. And then I
218.14s - 222.24s |  didn't hear a word for six months and I got a call from a recruiter whose name I, I did not
222.24s - 228.28s |  catch. Son, and back in the 70s, that's how older men talk to a punk kid like me. Son, if
228.28s - 233.28s |  you can report in two weeks, you got a job. Great. What is this job? Can't tell you. Okay.
235.96s - 241.62s |  How about give me a hint? Well, we'd like to offer you a position in our ComSec
241.64s - 250.10s |  communication security intern program. Great. What is that? Can't tell you. But if you go to
250.10s - 255.28s |  the Encyclopedia Britannica, this is the actual conversation in mid 70s, go to the
255.28s - 262.58s |  Encyclopedia Britannica and look up an article on cryptography. What? You had to spell it for
262.58s - 268.50s |  me. Crypto what? He said, yeah. And that'll give you an idea of what you're getting into. Hey,
268.52s - 273.10s |  but this job offer is only good for two weeks till the end of the fiscal year. Just give me a
273.10s - 277.06s |  yes or no. I said, I'll see you in two weeks. I don't have another job. So I showed up at
277.06s - 283.14s |  NSA. I'm a ComSec guy working with some of the most amazing, brilliant mathematicians
283.48s - 288.94s |  you'll ever bump into. Like you'll never bump into them because they're so weird. But, and
288.94s - 293.16s |  what was the job? I came into NSA. When you think of NSA, you're thinking of spying, right?
293.16s - 297.86s |  You're thinking of intelligence agency. There's a little tiny sliver of it that works
297.86s - 306.86s |  defense. If you're in a defensive role and you face an existential threat, right? Someone
306.86s - 312.46s |  who means you harm, to take you off this earth, to cause you great distress, but you don't
312.46s - 317.50s |  know much about them, what do you do in order to manage that risk? You hire a bunch of
317.50s - 321.30s |  wonks like me to sit in the back room and pretend to be the bad guy, right? Before there
321.32s - 326.10s |  was red teams and penetration testing and zero day finders, that's how governments
326.10s - 329.40s |  looked at this problem. And whether it was high consequence things like nuclear weapons
329.40s - 333.94s |  or cryptography, that's how someone like me got a job. So I had a really odd career at
333.94s - 338.94s |  NSA, 35 years in defense. All of it in a subset of that invulnerability analysis. Finding
342.68s - 347.68s |  flaws in protocols, mathematics, systems, software, hardware, signals, chemistry, the
348.20s - 353.20s |  kind of work that many of you do, right? It draws amazing people. Clever people. Great
357.24s - 362.62s |  technology. It is great fun. But I'm one of the few lifelong folks who've done this that
362.62s - 367.42s |  can say, I lived inside an intelligence agency. The biggest attack engine maybe in the
367.42s - 372.52s |  world. So that's what the talk is about today. A few lessons learned, right? A few
372.52s - 377.56s |  observations. How did that shape the way that I think about defense? That's what I want to
377.58s - 381.58s |  share with you today. I won't go through all this, the things, the jobs that I had. Those are
381.58s - 387.18s |  actually all names of organizations that I worked in. So ComSec became information
387.18s - 393.10s |  security. My life changed in 1981 because I switched from math to computer science. Some of
393.10s - 397.94s |  you are probably my generation. Because NSA would buy me an Apple 2 plus to have on my
397.94s - 402.94s |  desk for work. Oh my god, that was the coolest technology ever. I was hooked forever. And
403.16s - 409.56s |  so moving to computer science with a background in math let me ride the wave that we now call
409.56s - 416.36s |  cyber through all those jobs. So I'm going to share a couple, just rapidly some lessons
416.36s - 421.00s |  learned from my decades in this stuff. This sounds like a bumper sticker, right? In
421.00s - 426.00s |  cyberspace we all have more in common than different. But it's true. We are all deeply
426.32s - 431.32s |  connected. And we can't avoid it. And therefore we have to behave like it. But most of our
434.46s - 440.66s |  security industry is about your enterprise defending yourself. That's a loser strategy. I'll
440.66s - 445.58s |  talk more about how we need to think of this nationally. But we are deeply connected.
445.58s - 450.54s |  Including with the bad guys. Whether we know it or not. So you have to think about this
450.54s - 455.78s |  defense not as how do I get everybody to defend themselves and add it all up and hope I have a
455.80s - 461.50s |  secure economy. That will never happen. The bad guy doesn't do magic. I lived with
461.50s - 466.94s |  professional bad guys for my entire first career at the National Security Agency. They are
466.94s - 473.64s |  good at what they do, trust me. But they don't do magic. And if you treat them as magic,
473.64s - 478.34s |  right, oh my god we can never defend against the nation state adversary, oh my, if you
478.34s - 483.36s |  treat the attacker as a magician, you have only one defense. To hire your own magician.
486.06s - 491.26s |  To do your own magic. And that's a loser strategy, right? So I had bosses who looked over,
491.26s - 495.56s |  who are the scruffiest looking people in the room? Nothing personal. They must be the
495.56s - 502.20s |  smartest. Tony, exact quote from one of my top level bosses. Go hire me 50 of them hacker
502.20s - 508.58s |  kids so we can figure this problem out. Sir, be careful what you ask for. We're building a
508.62s - 516.12s |  new professional science here. And so scruffy doesn't always mean super smart or super
516.12s - 521.16s |  productive, sir. But a lot of folks didn't get that in those early days. But bad guys don't
521.16s - 527.36s |  do magic. They have a budget. They have a boss. They have their own risk model. They don't
527.36s - 531.44s |  like to get caught. They don't want to spend more money than they need to. And the more you
531.44s - 537.18s |  understand about the bad guy and the environment he operates in, the better you are able to
537.18s - 544.29s |  design your own defenses. Knowing about flaws doesn't get them fixed. And this is a
544.29s - 548.17s |  controversial one for some of you. Because many of you are in this business, right? This
548.17s - 553.13s |  whole conference is about this. Finding flaws. Present at a conference. Write a paper. Give a
553.13s - 560.25s |  demo. Here's my experience at the top levels of the US government for decades. Just pointing
560.27s - 565.27s |  out flaws never gets them fixed. Never. You cannot scare people or inspire them with your
569.51s - 575.83s |  cleverness into long term action. The business of fixing problems, yes, it has a technical
575.83s - 582.47s |  core. But it's about economics and incentives and psychology and public policy and
582.47s - 589.97s |  regulatory environments and the threats of lawsuits. That's what defense becomes. That's what
589.99s - 594.99s |  fixing problems requires. So when you create the incredible knowledge of flaws in software or in
597.77s - 602.77s |  systems and you demonstrate them, you have to understand you can't just proudly trotted out at an
605.91s - 610.91s |  event like this and walk away satisfied. That will never solve the problem at its root. You are
613.95s - 619.99s |  part of an information machine I'll talk about in a second. And I know plenty of people of my
620.01s - 624.57s |  generation who are still standing on the virtual street corners going, we solved that password
624.57s - 629.57s |  problem in 1975 with the Binford 9000 A1 evaluated, blah, blah, blah. You know? You don't want to
633.46s - 638.00s |  be that person in three decades, right? Ticked off at the industry because they didn't pay
638.00s - 645.04s |  attention to your wisdom. You want to be part of the solution. We need the cleverness, the
645.04s - 650.48s |  understanding of these problems. But we need to figure out systemic ways to do something with
650.50s - 654.62s |  them. Not stand on the street corner yelling about get off my lawn and why didn't they listen to
654.62s - 662.08s |  me in 1983. Defense is about choices. Defense is always about priority. And there's a thing in
666.46s - 671.60s |  mathematics, you've probably heard the term the Pareto principle or the 80-20 rule. Most of
671.60s - 675.76s |  your impact comes from 20 percent of your choices and only mathematicians could dream up
675.76s - 680.98s |  philosophy like that. But it turns out it's true in cyber security. That has driven my thinking
680.98s - 686.98s |  for 20 years now. The question is not can you solve the entire problem at once, the question is
686.98s - 692.20s |  how do we start it? What is the foundation of good defense? What are the next steps? What can I
692.20s - 697.78s |  build upon? If you follow uh my my second career in uh non-profit land with the center for net
697.78s - 704.00s |  security, this is a bedrock philosophy of our non-profit. Do not overwhelm people. Help
704.00s - 709.80s |  people. Get them started. Get them the foundation. Help them with a an on-ramp, a road map. How
709.80s - 715.20s |  are we gonna get there? That's the important part, not the cleverness of stone tablets or you
715.20s - 722.10s |  know multi-thousand page um control catalogs. And defense, again we think of it as
722.10s - 728.84s |  technology, defense is an information management problem. And you need to understand that.
728.84s - 733.86s |  Information about flaws has to get moved some place. It has to be in a form that can be used by
734.52s - 740.08s |  It has to be in a form that can be used by someone. It's always about moving information. That's
740.08s - 745.32s |  what I came to conclude in the early 2000s. And you know in this industry we say well you know if
745.32s - 750.36s |  we just if everyone would just share everything they know, we'll all be really smart and wise
750.36s - 756.72s |  and it'll get better. That has never worked ever in my experience. Because the verb that matters
756.72s - 762.72s |  is not share, the verb is translate. How do I translate millions of data points of badness that
762.72s - 770.46s |  I see every day translate into a relatively small number of positive constructive steps that
770.46s - 774.44s |  help me deal with the millions? You can't deal with millions. And the good news is you don't
774.44s - 779.64s |  have to. Right? Most attacks are actually repeats of a pattern. There aren't unique magical
779.64s - 784.28s |  attacks happening every day. There's millions of repeats of the same garbage happening every
784.28s - 790.62s |  day. And so you wanna pick those early steps in a way that gives you the most value and lets
790.62s - 795.96s |  you build your defenses from a starting point. Not try to solve it all in one meeting. And so
795.96s - 800.10s |  the conclusion for me was cyber security is not an event. It's not a technology. It's not a
800.10s - 805.60s |  training thing. It's all those plus it's an information machine. A machine powered by the
805.60s - 809.98s |  kind of analysis that folks like you do. The information that you understand about ways to
809.98s - 817.98s |  break. But it's just a starting point. And so this machinery of who can translate. Where is
817.98s - 823.02s |  the optimal place to solve a problem? I concluded long ago. It's not where you find it. We find
823.02s - 828.22s |  it in a lab. We find it in real life. But it turns out, at least at any scale, problems are
828.22s - 834.40s |  almost always best solved somewhere else. In policy. In acquisition. In configuration
834.40s - 840.64s |  management. In identity management across your enterprise. That is the solution space that
840.64s - 845.64s |  will stick. And so the key is the understanding you gain from flaws has to be translated into
848.58s - 854.72s |  information that helps people do those things better. Manage configurations. Set up their
854.72s - 860.08s |  systems. Train their people and so forth. So that takes more than, no one of us has all the
860.08s - 864.70s |  knowledge to pull all that together. So a couple other things. So the National Security
864.70s - 869.46s |  Agency. So how did this warp my thinking? So NSA, right? And some of you know the joke NSA, the
869.48s - 875.96s |  acronym means never say anything. Ha ha ha. It's also the name of my classic rock cover band, by
875.96s - 881.00s |  the way. If you ever want to come here. If you ever see a band never say anything, come see us.
881.00s - 887.34s |  We'll hit you with the Rolling Stones and the Joe Giles Band and so forth. But so NSA, you
887.34s - 892.50s |  probably think of primarily as an intelligence agency. And that's fair. Spying on people. And
892.50s - 896.58s |  some of you may find that distasteful. Some of you may have all kinds of things to say. Let me
896.60s - 902.80s |  just tell you this. I spent 35 years there. Proud to have served there. Law abiding, rule
902.80s - 907.64s |  following, good people doing their best for their country, right? Dealing with a really
907.64s - 910.88s |  dangerous world. Whatever you think of this whole business of counterintelligence,
910.88s - 915.88s |  intelligence and spying, you know at its core, the world is a dangerous place. It's not just for
918.78s - 925.98s |  the U.S., it's for every friend, it's for every bystander. It's a dangerous place. And
926.00s - 931.20s |  countries will do whatever it takes to get an advantage in that space. And that's the nature
931.20s - 937.80s |  of what happens every day around the globe. Spying is a part of our lives. Whether you like it,
937.80s - 943.08s |  accept it or care about it, it's part of the deal. But the other part of the mission, so they
943.08s - 947.04s |  would traditionally say NSA has two missions, signals intelligence and information
947.04s - 951.28s |  assurance was kind of the way I thought of it for most of my career. Now they really
951.28s - 958.24s |  describe it as cyber security. So when you put offensive together, what do you get? Well, in
958.24s - 963.24s |  the NSA case, if it was a pie, 90% of that pie is signals intelligence, right? It's the spying
967.10s - 972.90s |  business. It's the attack engine. And then there's a little old folks like me in defense. The
972.90s - 980.04s |  10%. 10% of the people, 10% of the resources, right? Attacking versus defending. And then
983.42s - 988.24s |  defense. That's historically how it worked out. It wasn't a conscious choice to say defense is
988.24s - 997.46s |  less important. That's historically how it worked out. But this kind of structure, 90 to 10, also
997.46s - 1002.96s |  drives culture. And for those of you who don't care about management stuff, I used to have to.
1002.96s - 1009.96s |  Culture is a fancy word for what do people believe? How do they make decisions? What do they
1009.96s - 1016.96s |  think is right? What do they think is wrong? Those are very strong in many institutions, in many
1016.96s - 1023.12s |  companies. In a place like NSA, which is a quasi military support organization, culture is
1023.12s - 1028.12s |  incredibly powerful. We spend a lot of time thinking about it. And it drives your behavior. But at
1031.42s - 1037.66s |  some point in the early 2000s, and to give you an idea of the different ways that culture can help
1037.66s - 1043.50s |  you perceive the problem, I would use in a speech like this, what I call the NSA offense defense
1043.50s - 1050.70s |  culture test. Would you like to take it? Of course you would. And it goes something like this. In a
1050.70s - 1058.20s |  world where we're all using basically the same technology, we're all on the same network, and we
1058.20s - 1066.32s |  are connected to each other in ways that we do not understand until something bad happens, then I
1066.36s - 1071.36s |  can only conclude one thing when I think about defense at the national level. No one gets better
1074.12s - 1079.12s |  until everybody gets better, comma, here comes a test, wait for it. No one gets better until
1081.78s - 1087.78s |  everybody gets better, comma, including the bad guys. So if you agree, including the bad guys,
1090.82s - 1095.90s |  you've probably worked defense most of your life. Because you recognize we are deeply connected,
1095.90s - 1101.16s |  right? We can't separate, there's no perimeter, there's no border, there's no, we are on there.
1101.16s - 1109.16s |  We attack them, they attack us, it's just a constant flow. If you argue with me and try to talk me
1109.16s - 1116.66s |  out of that last clause, including the bad guys, you probably spent your life working in offense.
1116.66s - 1124.66s |  Because you like easy targets. A world of flawed technology is your playground. You get to do what
1126.12s - 1133.12s |  you want and you would desperately like to separate the problem of offense from defense. I had some
1133.12s - 1139.04s |  of the smartest people in my entire career say some of the dumbest things I've ever heard. Hey
1139.04s - 1144.08s |  Tony, why don't we write, why don't we write our own patches for Microsoft software in the defense
1144.08s - 1151.16s |  department? Please, please, are you kidding me? Why don't we write a friendly worm that runs
1151.16s - 1157.16s |  through the entire internet and fixes our systems but not theirs? Please, come on. Alright, that's
1159.88s - 1166.86s |  desperation. You're trying to separate the two problems. Impossible. It'll never happen. But
1166.86s - 1172.36s |  in, also in cultures you have subcultures like at NSA. So when I, I mentioned we released to the
1172.36s - 1177.82s |  public the NSA security guides in 2001. Guess who the primary objectors were when I was, was
1177.82s - 1184.54s |  carrying this campaign out? The people who work defense. What did they say? You ever heard this
1184.54s - 1189.00s |  phrase in your organization if you work in a large organization? The other side of the house will
1189.00s - 1198.64s |  never let us do it. That's people that are beaten down by culture. They believe their work, right?
1198.64s - 1203.10s |  That little information trip is less important than the attack mission. I stopped meetings, I said
1203.12s - 1210.38s |  stop. Do not make their argument for them. Our mission is just as important. I'm not saying it's
1210.38s - 1218.38s |  more important, but it's just as important and you cannot just give up on this. And then I would
1218.38s - 1223.90s |  say, you say the other side will object? Give me a name. Give me a name. And they would name
1223.90s - 1228.70s |  some leading light of the attack engine. I already talked to them, they're good with this. See, I'm
1228.70s - 1233.34s |  a pretty good bureaucrat, too. I was ready. I was ready for these questions. But that's how strong
1233.34s - 1239.84s |  culture is. But it's also recognition. What does the boss care about? Who gets rewarded? On the
1239.84s - 1245.04s |  attack side, you get to say, these evil people who mean us harm are no longer on this earth
1245.04s - 1251.04s |  thanks to our work. People talk like that, by the way. On defense, what do you say? Well, we really
1251.04s - 1254.92s |  worked hard with this and they're doing a better job with software acquisition because we're
1254.92s - 1259.44s |  helping them configure this stuff ahead of time. Guess who gets the recognition and the reward?
1259.44s - 1264.74s |  Guess where the management pays attention? That's where cultures are strong. So it sounds like I
1264.74s - 1270.54s |  hated working at NSA, right, as a defender? Not at all. But at some point, I found it frustrating
1270.54s - 1276.22s |  because of this mismatch. And I was, I gave serious thought to maybe it's time for me to leave
1276.22s - 1282.18s |  NSA in the middle of my career. Go to a DISA, go to a NIST, go to wherever. What I realized, I could
1282.18s - 1288.52s |  do so much more to affect defense from within inside an offensive organization. And remember
1288.52s - 1294.66s |  this. Defense wins championships, right? Football season's coming. But offense wins budgets every
1294.66s - 1300.76s |  time. Even fake offense wins budgets. How many of you have been in a company where they brought
1300.76s - 1305.84s |  in a red team and what you saw as a result was like, well, we knew that. All the IT people knew
1305.84s - 1311.04s |  that. The com sec people knew that. Security people knew that. We just, how often will we pay to
1311.04s - 1315.38s |  rediscover what we already knew? But people love red teaming because it's mysterious and spooky
1315.38s - 1321.08s |  and it's cool. And they worked for me. I love them. They're great at what they do. But people will
1321.08s - 1326.86s |  spend money to rediscover the obvious before they'll spend money to fix the obvious. Isn't that
1326.86s - 1332.76s |  a crime? So Pac-Man eats up the little guys, right? But no. So offense plus defense. A couple of
1332.76s - 1337.30s |  thoughts here. I'm sorry, I will riff on this all day and I don't want to subject you to that. What I
1337.30s - 1344.64s |  learned though, being part of that offensive engine, the amount of money that drives the offense,
1344.64s - 1350.10s |  the spinoff into defense of cross-training people in both offense and defense, astounding. You
1350.10s - 1354.44s |  could never get that kind of resources together in a, and I say this with respect to my many
1354.44s - 1360.98s |  government friends at a NIST or a DISA or places like that. Never. The access to the resources, the
1361.00s - 1367.38s |  financial, the attention of senior law, policy makers in the U.S. government, the worldwide
1367.38s - 1375.52s |  insight to watch a worldwide attack engine at full speed gives you that understanding. They're
1375.52s - 1381.76s |  good at what they do, but what they do is complex and fragile. And if you pick the right steps, you
1381.76s - 1389.70s |  can cause them great harm, pain, or fear of discovery. In fact, you learn things like one thing
1389.72s - 1395.36s |  that attackers don't like is uncertainty. They have to spend money, they have to convince a boss,
1395.36s - 1402.14s |  they have to take risks. So learning to manipulate their uncertainty is a key defensive strategy.
1402.14s - 1408.48s |  You also learn that when nations attack, it's not just about packets and bad software and missing
1408.48s - 1414.28s |  patches. They attack everything, as I hinted early. The signals in the air, the chemistry of your
1414.30s - 1423.84s |  machines, your human beings, your physical locks, all that is fair game in nation state attacks. And
1423.84s - 1428.72s |  that's the way that you have to think of it. And so we've used the term, like even in our work
1428.72s - 1432.26s |  today at the Center for Internet Security, offense informs defense. You also have to think of
1432.26s - 1437.02s |  defense informs offense. When you're part of the attack engine, you get to see how other people
1437.02s - 1445.18s |  defend themselves. That often tells you what they know is vulnerable and therefore how they're
1445.18s - 1451.16s |  going to attack you. So being able to pull all this insight into one place has been an incredible
1451.16s - 1457.64s |  experience and really shaped my thinking about defense. So just a couple last things I'll say
1457.64s - 1463.48s |  here and then I'll wrap up. So many of you are in the business, right, are really good at the
1463.48s - 1468.02s |  business of finding flaws. But in NSA, we tried to have some rigor in the way we thought about it.
1468.44s - 1474.28s |  And we would, because people in this industry throw around attack, exploit, flaw, weakness, zero
1474.28s - 1479.92s |  day, they throw this stuff around without definition. So it all sounds the same, especially to
1479.92s - 1485.30s |  policy makers. This is the sort of scale I used back then. Weaknesses are something that makes the
1485.30s - 1489.60s |  analyst feel a little oogie. You know, I know there's got to be something there to attack. Is
1489.60s - 1494.80s |  there a flaw there? They failed to authenticate this transaction. Does it indicate a
1494.88s - 1501.12s |  vulnerability? A potentially exploitable condition. I cannot explain to you how much money we
1501.12s - 1505.50s |  spent to go from vulnerability to actually attacks in things like red teaming. It's
1505.50s - 1511.50s |  non-trivial. And so your understanding of risk is really different depending on how you think
1511.50s - 1515.94s |  of that problem. And so exploits, how do I put a series of steps together to take advantage of
1515.94s - 1524.08s |  that vulnerability? Attack is about real life. The real life conditions of what the world looks
1524.10s - 1529.10s |  like, which is what the attacker really has to deal with. And so again, variability,
1529.10s - 1534.24s |  uncertainty, visibility, those are all things that they care about on their end. And I won't go
1534.24s - 1540.48s |  through this here. Last thing, what I'll leave you with here is, oh, is this like the, I've
1540.48s - 1545.32s |  never been chased out of a room by a bird before. I promise there are no active electronics on
1545.32s - 1552.82s |  that bird. But remember this, especially when you think of this at the national level, there's
1553.82s - 1560.96s |  always two levels of attack happening all the time. The difference between the, and we tend
1560.96s - 1567.20s |  to think of this industry as about technical attacks on each other. But the technical
1567.20s - 1572.18s |  attacker, the bird has just left, the Elvis has left the building and the bird has left the
1572.18s - 1577.18s |  room. Remember that the attacker usually reports to a senior decision maker, a military
1577.50s - 1582.50s |  leader, a political person. And so there are two levels of defense, right? Manipulating the
1586.38s - 1591.38s |  attack to stop it technically, or causing uncertainty in the eyes of the decision maker. So
1594.38s - 1599.86s |  the decision maker comes to the technical walk and says, you tell me that if hostility starts,
1599.86s - 1603.82s |  your cyber attack will bring down the radars of that company so they won't be able to,
1603.84s - 1607.14s |  the country, so they won't be able to see our planes coming in. You tell me that you're
1607.14s - 1613.08s |  certain that's going to work. Sir, we're really sure. We have tested in the lab several
1613.08s - 1618.08s |  times. You've tested it in the lab several times and you want me to put my reputation, my,
1620.82s - 1626.22s |  maybe my life based upon you've tested it in the lab a couple of times? So that's a second
1626.22s - 1631.22s |  way to manipulate defense by manipulating the attacker on the other end. All right, so, so
1633.94s - 1638.80s |  the summary. I spent my life, again, I had the, the incredible opportunity to serve my
1638.80s - 1643.80s |  country this, uh, 35 years in cyber defense or help, help shape, ride the wave, become a big
1646.18s - 1651.18s |  part of what I think, uh, the, the industry has become. Do it in a really unique setting
1652.32s - 1657.22s |  and then recognize that that setting helped shape the way I think of this problem. And my
1657.22s - 1662.22s |  invitation to you, the audience here, you are the information, the creators that can help drive
1663.82s - 1669.52s |  the machine of solutions, but you're not going to do it. It's great to come out here, give
1669.52s - 1675.96s |  the talk, show the demo, write the paper. You've got to find how do you become part of that
1675.96s - 1682.38s |  machine? Part of that solution, whose information, whose hands does it need to be in to make a
1682.38s - 1687.88s |  difference? And you can find your friends in government. You can find them in the, uh, you
1687.88s - 1692.66s |  know, responsible disclosure community. You can find them in nonprofit space. But the goal is
1692.66s - 1697.16s |  you don't solve the problem by yourself. You build alliances that will help you drive this
1697.16s - 1702.16s |  machine so that we're all living in a safer place. So let me just wrap up here. 2007, I was
1702.16s - 1706.40s |  here for the first time. I didn't know if I was going to be greeted as an NSA person by
1706.40s - 1711.88s |  villagers with torches and pitchforks or chased out. It, it turned out I need not worry. Even
1711.88s - 1718.82s |  at Defcon, the people were so respectful and thankful that someone who worked this kind of a
1718.82s - 1723.38s |  job from the government would come out to the talk to them. And so my, my career, you know,
1723.38s - 1727.82s |  was shaped by that kind of experience, right? To bring us out to be a part of this community. Yes,
1727.82s - 1732.72s |  there've been ups and downs and moments or times in history where it's awkward for industry to
1732.72s - 1737.56s |  work with the U.S. government, et cetera, et cetera. But at the end of the day, there's so
1737.56s - 1741.80s |  many great people in this industry, government, private sector, academics, independents,
1741.80s - 1746.54s |  nonprofits. I just have to believe I'm still that hopeless optimist that we can make a
1746.54s - 1749.44s |  difference in this industry. So thank you for giving me a chance to come out here. Thank you
1749.44s - 1752.96s |  for ending your day here. If you have questions or want to talk, I'll stick around for a few
1752.96s - 1754.00s |  minutes, but thank you again very much.
