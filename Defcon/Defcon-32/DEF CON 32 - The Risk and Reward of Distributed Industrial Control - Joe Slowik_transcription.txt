  "description": "Economic efficiency and increasing automation mean that many industrial assets are remotely monitored and controlled. While some assets, such as oil production platforms, remain manned in isolated conditions, the ecosystem of renewable energy and distributed energy resources (DERs), pipelines, and other assets are increasingly unmanned with control extending over common information links. While this has been a boon for cost, it has also resulted in a radical extension of attack surface for cyber operations.\n\nIn this discussion, we will explore the nature of distributed industrial asset operation and the opportunities this presents for adversaries to infiltrate and potentially disrupt critical infrastructure operations. To make this point, we will review examples of adversary activity, from the 2022 ViaSat incident through historical pipeline intrusions (NOT Colonial!), showing how adversaries intentionally or inadvertently prey on brittle communication links for industrial disruption. We will conclude with a discussion of how these risks can be mitigated in a way that is sensible and economical, because wind farm operators won't lay their own dedicated fiber anytime soon.",

0.00s - 5.60s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 So, should we get started? Okay, I guess we're getting started. So, hello everyone. Welcome to
5.60s - 10.00s |  DEF CON at the lovely Las Vegas Convention Center. A fabulous new venue that we're all
10.00s - 14.00s |  learning to deal with. First off, can folks who are sitting in the back hear me? Because I know
14.00s - 19.68s |  it's a pretty difficult room. So, there's plenty of space up here. Feel free to move forward or
19.68s - 23.28s |  whatever. The screens are also a little tiny if you're sitting in the back. Trust me, I don't
23.28s - 27.52s |  bite and I don't think anyone else here does either. But what we'll talk about today is
27.52s - 32.96s |  getting into the risk and reward of distributed industrial control systems. First, who am I? My
32.96s - 37.68s |  name is Joe Slowik. I currently do a bunch of things over at the MITRE Corporation, like leading
37.68s - 41.76s |  up some of the functions within ATT&CK and doing critical infrastructure research. And I've done
41.76s - 45.60s |  a bunch of things previously, but no one gives a crap about me. We're here to talk about industrial
45.60s - 50.40s |  control systems and how these things are increasingly interconnected and exposed.
50.40s - 54.56s |  So, our agenda is we're going to talk about what distributed operations mean and how this
54.56s - 60.56s |  works to extend the ATT&CK surface of industrial assets. We'll look at this from the perspective
60.56s - 65.12s |  of what opportunities this affords adversaries, and then talk about some risks and considerations
65.12s - 69.76s |  and what we can meaningfully do about this new interconnected, networked, and exposed
69.76s - 74.00s |  landscape that we're dealing with for fairly important things like critical infrastructure
74.00s - 79.52s |  operations. So first, distributed industrial operations. What does that actually mean?
80.16s - 83.92s |  Well, if you talk to a lot of people that don't have a whole lot of experience or have a lot of
83.92s - 87.84s |  assumptions around what industrial environments look like, you would get a picture such as what I
87.84s - 93.28s |  hope is up on the screen right now, because I know there's been some issues, that there is an
93.28s - 98.88s |  error gap that exists segmenting networks quite thoroughly between an internet-connected environment
98.88s - 104.08s |  and a plant environment, which has no external connectivity whatsoever. That may still be the
104.08s - 108.64s |  case in certain areas, like nuclear generation, for example, but has largely never really been
108.64s - 113.52s |  the case in many environments and certainly isn't the case anymore for the majority of operations
113.52s - 118.96s |  that exist. Instead, we're all living in a networked world right now, where we're increasingly
118.96s - 123.76s |  seeing systems that you would normally assume would be walled off from the rest of the world
123.76s - 130.32s |  are connected and need to be connected to systems that need to talk to something external to your
130.32s - 134.56s |  environment. There is a measure of internet connectivity involved. It can be controlled,
134.56s - 138.48s |  limited. You can talk about things like data diodes and other sorts of technologies,
138.48s - 142.40s |  but generally speaking, data needs to get in and some data is going to need to get out.
143.04s - 148.08s |  So in looking at this, in legacy environments, we're really talking about operations and control
148.08s - 152.96s |  are co-located. So one of the things that enabled that error gap to exist is that you had
152.96s - 157.20s |  your operators and the physical equipment they were dealing with were co-located at the same
157.20s - 162.80s |  physical site where plant networks stop at the physical boundary of the facility. So you didn't
162.80s - 167.12s |  have to worry about networking these things. However, more modern operations, if we're talking
167.12s - 172.16s |  about things like wind farms, pipelines, increasingly ambitious mining operations,
172.16s - 177.92s |  or offshore oil and gas exploration, we're really talking about controlling systems that now extend
177.92s - 183.76s |  in geographically dispersed ways where we have to distribute operations and a lack of manning,
183.76s - 188.64s |  both because it's very difficult to try to staff every single compressor station along a pipeline
188.64s - 193.52s |  or every single wind farm that exists in Western Kansas or something along those lines,
193.52s - 197.84s |  that we need remote operations control, monitoring, et cetera, to make these things happen.
197.84s - 202.32s |  So this isn't just a cost-saving mechanism at this point. It's a necessity based upon how we have
202.32s - 207.28s |  built out infrastructure and how very vital aspects of the current critical infrastructure
207.28s - 212.88s |  mix function. Now, this isn't especially new. So those of you who are familiar with the electric
213.68s - 217.84s |  operations and similar, like, well, we've had energy management systems, transmission management
217.84s - 223.36s |  systems, and similar that have centralized management of fairly complex and geographically
223.36s - 228.80s |  distributed systems for quite some time and has operated in a fairly analog fashion in a number
228.80s - 234.48s |  of cases as well. So even getting outside of digital technologies. So we've been doing bits
234.48s - 239.76s |  of this for quite some time and do it rather well in certain cases, too. But what we're really
239.76s - 243.92s |  looking at now is a radicalization of how this connectivity works, because now we're getting
243.92s - 249.76s |  away from things like hardline connectivity to all of these assets or using things like,
249.76s - 254.96s |  you know, telephone lines or buried fiber and getting into an increasingly wireless ecosystem
254.96s - 260.08s |  to facilitate this communication where we're relying upon things like satellite communications,
260.08s - 264.40s |  5G, 4G networks, and similar to make this happen, which introduced some interesting
264.40s - 270.24s |  security repercussions to how this communication is taking place. So what we're looking at is that,
270.24s - 274.08s |  yes, we've done some of this remote management historically, but now we're doing it in a much
274.08s - 280.64s |  more prevalent and in a much more potentially insecure or attack surface magnifying way,
280.64s - 285.44s |  where economics, efficiency, and just the way that we operate have driven unmanned and remote
285.44s - 290.24s |  operations in a number of sectors. Technology advances, however, are permitting easier
290.24s - 294.96s |  connectivity with remote assets. Having a classic VSAT, very small arpiture terminal,
294.96s - 299.44s |  10 or 20 years ago for a remote mining site is like trying to suck a grape through a straw
299.44s - 305.12s |  when it comes to bandwidth and connectivity, whereas now advances in technology,
305.12s - 309.12s |  the expansion of satellite constellations and so forth have dramatically increased the bandwidth
309.12s - 314.80s |  available for these type of networks and expanded the scope of what we could reasonably expect to do
314.80s - 319.04s |  with these sorts of control systems. And furthermore, industry trends like distributed
319.04s - 324.16s |  energy resources, as well as things like vendor remote telemetry and remote preventative maintenance
324.16s - 329.36s |  and so forth, are accelerating these trends by requiring that asset owners increasingly
329.36s - 334.32s |  allow for connectivity to their industrial assets. So now we're getting into things like having
334.32s - 339.76s |  assets or at least elements of assets connected to, if not residing, in cloud-based instances,
339.76s - 346.16s |  which dramatically changes what the ideas of segmentation look like in terms of how these
346.16s - 350.96s |  environments can operate. So in looking at our options for remote connectivity, we certainly
350.96s - 355.68s |  have some traditional items that are out there, like our plain old telephone system, dedicated
355.68s - 361.28s |  fiber, or fairly uncontroversial and historical in nature. But now we're really talking about
361.28s - 364.72s |  expanding the use of cellular modems, which have also been around for quite some time,
365.36s - 370.56s |  getting into increased adoption of satellite systems for enabling these systems to talk to
370.56s - 376.00s |  one another, and using a variety of 5G and wireless technologies to facilitate this sort
376.00s - 382.08s |  of communication. So what does this mean? Well, it has lots of operational elements to it in terms
382.08s - 388.48s |  of how industrial asset management, monitoring, and control function, but also adversaries are
388.48s - 393.12s |  involved in these conversations as well, because we're also talking about dramatic changes to what
393.12s - 398.32s |  the attack surface looks like for these types of resources. So when looking at always online
398.32s - 403.20s |  industrial systems, we're really expanding scope out so that if we're talking about a distributed
403.20s - 407.92s |  satellite communication network, where you have communications bouncing to an overhead asset and
407.92s - 412.96s |  then going to a ground communication center, that you have a variety of wired and wireless links that
412.96s - 418.16s |  become involved in connecting various assets up and multiple potential touch points to get into
418.16s - 423.76s |  and interact with that network. Similarly, for 5G or other sorts of wireless terrestrial networks,
423.76s - 428.64s |  we're talking about mesh networks of multiple devices that can talk to one another and communicate
428.64s - 433.44s |  in a variety of ways that introduce a very interesting landscape in terms of who can
433.44s - 438.16s |  talk to whom and how you control the directionality of such communication. But also, we're talking
438.16s - 443.20s |  about systems where we're rapidly integrating vendors being able to consistently monitor and
443.20s - 449.44s |  potentially even interact with their environments as well, such as the GE Atlanta data highway for
453.84s - 458.48s |  generating assets produced by that company. We're seeing this across a variety of vendors where you
458.56s - 464.08s |  have assets tied to vendor management and monitoring for preventative maintenance, remote
464.08s - 469.12s |  management, and just big data analytics and so forth to fuel product development and product
469.12s - 474.32s |  support. So in looking at these connectivity functions and dependencies, there's certainly
474.32s - 479.52s |  the remote access and maintenance aspect of things of how do you operate power plants that are spread
479.52s - 484.96s |  out over a wide geographic area and control them in a way that makes sense, that remote control and
484.96s - 489.36s |  operations aspect, but also the telemetry and health check aspect of how do I make sure things
489.36s - 494.40s |  are running and running as I want them to, but also getting into very commercial aspects like
494.40s - 499.20s |  licensing and use monitoring. Are you operating your equipment in line with the contract that
499.20s - 503.84s |  you signed and using it within the boundaries of what it is that we agreed to commercially?
504.56s - 509.20s |  Finally, we get system of system items as well, such as coordination, balancing, and management
509.20s - 513.28s |  of wider scope systems, whether we're talking about things like maintaining frequency phase,
513.28s - 517.60s |  et cetera, for the overall electric system or managing pipelines to ensure that they are
517.60s - 522.88s |  adequately pressurized along their entire length to allow for product delivery across their entire
522.88s - 527.92s |  network. So what this means is that as we've started expanding these sorts of functionalities
527.92s - 532.88s |  and exposing these items through wireless and other means, it's providing opportunities for
532.88s - 538.00s |  adversaries to interact with these elements in ways that didn't really exist previously.
538.00s - 542.88s |  So what does that look like? Well, what it looks like is that we have distributed overlapping
542.88s - 549.20s |  communications that are really good for efficient, reasonably reliable if there are fail-safes and
549.20s - 553.76s |  backups involved in how these are put together. But in doing so, we've also expanded the attack
553.76s - 561.04s |  surface in such a manner that it's no longer about accessing the external facing IT or classic
561.04s - 565.84s |  business network assets of an industrial asset owner and operator, and then digging your way
565.84s - 570.40s |  through the network to get into the industrial environment through several lateral movement hops
570.40s - 575.12s |  and so forth. But instead, I may be able to hit those assets directly either through a wireless
575.12s - 580.56s |  communication mechanism or because the way in which these assets are networked overall allows
580.56s - 585.60s |  me to access the provider in such a way that I can now start delivering payloads directly to
585.60s - 590.72s |  the critical assets within the environment, or at least the networking assets that are facilitating
590.72s - 594.40s |  the connectivity of those assets to the wider environment. And we're going to look at an
594.40s - 599.44s |  example of that here in just one slide. But the thing is that we're really talking about
599.44s - 604.16s |  expanding the opportunities of adversaries to interact via these new communication mechanisms
604.16s - 610.24s |  in a distributed environment that increases the opportunities for adversaries to interfere with,
610.24s - 617.60s |  inject into, or otherwise send commands to these sorts of assets for a variety of potential reasons.
617.60s - 622.48s |  So what does this look like in practice? Well, we have one really interesting example from a couple
622.48s - 626.48s |  of years ago. For those who were following the news at the time, at the very start of the current
626.48s - 633.52s |  phase of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, there was a interruption to the KASAT network owned by
633.52s - 639.20s |  Viasat, managed by a subsidiary, by a contracting entity that resulted not just in a disruption of
639.20s - 645.60s |  communication for Ukrainian military operations that was using the KASAT network, but also resulted
645.60s - 651.12s |  in a significant outage for wind turbines manufactured by a German company called Enercon,
651.12s - 658.08s |  where essentially a loss of view and debatably a loss of control situation manifested because the
658.96s - 663.76s |  terminals, the modems that were being used to connect these wind farm systems to remote control
663.76s - 669.36s |  and management systems were bricked by a family of malware labeled by Sentinel-1 researchers as
669.36s - 675.04s |  acid rain. While it was not intentional, or we at least do not think that it was intentional in this
675.04s - 681.76s |  event, that taking out this wind generation was purposeful, still in attacking the KASAT network
681.76s - 688.00s |  through the delivery of the push of basically a malicious software payload to customer terminals
688.00s - 693.28s |  within the overall environment, they were able to knock offline a variety of generating assets. Now
693.28s - 699.36s |  certainly if you're talking about remote wind and etc, there are fail safes that step into play in
699.36s - 704.96s |  order to cause these things to at least fail safely, fail relatively securely, but we're still
704.96s - 709.92s |  talking about placing these assets into a state where they're no longer able to sync effectively
709.92s - 715.04s |  with the broader environment and no longer able to effectively manage them as we would if that
715.04s - 720.24s |  connectivity existed as it was intended to do so. So certainly putting a fairly interesting element
720.24s - 725.04s |  and an increasingly important element of our generating mix at risk when we start talking
725.04s - 730.64s |  about things like distributed wind, distributed solar, and even getting into things like rooftop
730.64s - 735.20s |  solar etc, which may rely upon wireless communication mechanisms and the use of
736.08s - 740.88s |  various networking devices and so forth that have vulnerabilities in them, or have the possibility
740.88s - 745.84s |  of a acid rain like scenario where we could potentially push a malicious payload via access
745.84s - 751.20s |  to some other elements within the overall network to cause widespread impacts and outages across all
751.20s - 756.96s |  the interlinked devices. We also have the colonial pipeline incident. I put an asterisk on this
756.96s - 762.00s |  because this really was more of a proof of concept in terms of what may have occurred as
762.00s - 767.36s |  opposed to what actually occurred. So for colonial pipeline, colonial pipeline basically shut their
767.36s - 772.08s |  own operations down because they lacked the visibility and the confidence in saying that
772.08s - 776.96s |  they were able to run a effective network that was also that could be ran safe but also could
776.96s - 781.92s |  track things like product delivery as a result of a ransomware incident. But out of the colonial
781.92s - 788.96s |  pipeline event, you saw a number of commentators, I'll use that word pejoratively, that asked
788.96s - 792.08s |  questions about, well, why not just air gap everything? It's like, it's a couple thousand
792.08s - 796.80s |  mile pipeline. It's only got like seven or eight compressor stations and maybe a dozen PLCs, right?
796.80s - 801.68s |  How hard could that be to network all that together with buried fiber? The answer to that is
801.68s - 806.80s |  that it's not easy. And while colonial pipeline resulted from an impact on the business network,
806.80s - 811.12s |  it doesn't take a whole lot to expand our conception of what a pipeline incident might look
811.12s - 817.60s |  like to being able to interact with compressor stations that are remote, often unmanned, and
817.60s - 822.48s |  relying upon increasingly wireless communications, although there are still hardwired communications
822.48s - 827.60s |  in play, to allow for interaction with how that pipeline functions to induce conditions like a
827.60s - 831.76s |  loss of view because you're no longer able to communicate with a specific compressor station.
831.76s - 835.92s |  Depending on how things work, and this gets a little bit more interesting in terms of what
835.92s - 841.20s |  possibilities are available, you could, with sufficient access and poor segmentation and so
841.20s - 846.48s |  forth, be able to inject controls into a legitimate way of operating and maintaining that pipeline
846.48s - 850.96s |  to start inducing potential catastrophic events like an overpressure or underpressure
850.96s - 856.88s |  situation that would result in pipeline disruption. Not really easy, and it's debatable how practical
856.88s - 861.44s |  that would be for an adversary to do, but if we're exposing control systems that relate to the
861.44s - 865.52s |  fundamental operation of these assets, then especially if those controls are going over the
865.52s - 870.32s |  air in an unencrypted way that aren't using proper check sums to validate commands and controls that
870.32s - 876.16s |  are going over that environment, the possibilities for replaying, capturing, or potentially modifying
876.16s - 881.44s |  control system logic as it moves over unsecure lines or over the air starts becoming a very
881.44s - 886.96s |  interesting scenario for how to achieve far more lasting and concerning effects than what we saw
886.96s - 892.32s |  with the ransomware incident a few years ago. So, in looking overall at this, we see that there's
892.32s - 897.04s |  a variety of diverse opportunities that are available for adversaries in terms of their
897.04s - 904.64s |  ability to control or to interact with critical infrastructure elements enabled by an increasingly
904.64s - 909.60s |  remote perspective on how these systems are managed and maintained. So, certainly there are
909.60s - 914.88s |  IT-focused disruption mechanisms that can take place against control centers, which can be very
914.88s - 919.76s |  interesting because rather than having, say, control centers distributed among various assets,
919.76s - 925.76s |  now I have one centralized control and management station sitting in Spain, if I'm Siemens Gamesa
925.76s - 931.20s |  or something like that, or one centralized control station located elsewhere that the vendor is
931.20s - 935.84s |  managing in order to maintain a wind farm or a fleet of wind farms, that if that gets taken out
935.84s - 941.04s |  through ransomware, something deliberate and more malicious, etc., can I still operate all those
941.04s - 945.44s |  facilities in a safe and effective manner that allows for them to continue to be part of the
945.44s - 953.92s |  overall energy mix? But also, we have more end state or field device potential scenarios that
953.92s - 959.28s |  come from subversion or injection into these communication environments. So, here we're talking
959.28s - 965.52s |  about possibilities like, well, looking at the Enercon scenario where I can specifically and
965.52s - 970.72s |  deliberately take out the communication devices that tie these systems back into
970.72s - 977.28s |  centralized monitoring and control, or like a theoretical pipeline attack scenario,
977.28s - 982.96s |  leverage my ability to inject into insecure communication streams to send rogue commands
982.96s - 988.56s |  similar to what we see – ooh, there's a microphone – similar to what we see like the using of a tool
988.56s - 994.72s |  like Frosty Goop, which was in the news a few weeks ago, in terms of injecting Modbus communication
994.72s - 998.64s |  logic in order to have effects on central heating in Ukraine, but something like that
998.64s - 1004.24s |  taking place without having the IT intrusion, but rather based off of the ability to interact
1004.24s - 1009.12s |  directly with control systems over a wireless communication link that doesn't involve breaching
1009.12s - 1015.12s |  another aspect of the asset owner's network, or may involve breaching the contracting entity
1015.12s - 1020.88s |  that's providing that communication infrastructure in order to then deliver that follow-on effect
1020.88s - 1025.60s |  to the actual industrial assets that are interesting. Either way, we look at these
1025.60s - 1031.20s |  two different sides of the equation between going after the centralized control and management,
1031.20s - 1035.12s |  the single points of failure for how these networks are operated in many ways, which is why
1035.12s - 1040.80s |  they are typically very well secured. If you've gone to an electric utilities EMS or transmission
1040.80s - 1045.68s |  management system, where it's physically located, there is significant physical security. These are
1045.68s - 1051.52s |  crown jewel assets for IT security. They're not exactly poorly defended, but if we start talking
1051.52s - 1056.24s |  one layer up from the actual management and maintenance, that if you can't get commands
1056.24s - 1061.04s |  out from that center, from those consoles out to the devices in the field that you're trying to
1061.04s - 1066.40s |  maintain and manage, things can go south very quickly and result in systems that, if they don't
1066.40s - 1073.44s |  have the proper resilience and failovers in place, can start entering into very unsafe and uncertain
1073.44s - 1079.60s |  states fairly quickly. In looking at these considerations, the main worry that I have,
1079.60s - 1085.68s |  at least, and that we're starting to see in some of these technologies and implementations is that
1085.68s - 1090.96s |  in the drive for efficiency, like, oh, we could use the Starlink constellation and just put little
1090.96s - 1096.24s |  satellite receivers or whatever at all of our end stations, and we have connectivity for relatively
1096.24s - 1101.52s |  low cost with fairly good bandwidth that we can tie all these items together. That's true, but if
1101.52s - 1106.40s |  that constellation should go down or if there is a malicious update that's pushed to Starlink
1106.40s - 1111.92s |  terminals or some other scenario manifests, how do we then ensure that that system can retain
1111.92s - 1116.96s |  operational, and how long do we have until that system needs to switch into an emergency state
1116.96s - 1121.60s |  to ensure the continued viable operation of critical infrastructure assets like
1121.60s - 1127.68s |  electricity generation, pipeline operations, remote mining operations, offshore oil and gas
1127.68s - 1133.20s |  exploration and drilling, etc. So, the result is that the possibilities emerge for severing or
1134.00s - 1138.80s |  degrading active control mechanisms in these sorts of environments that can place these
1138.80s - 1144.00s |  ecosystems at risk. This gets us into a situation where, if you're familiar with ICS for ATT&CK,
1144.00s - 1148.88s |  the framework for mapping out potential adversary opportunities for interacting
1148.88s - 1153.68s |  with industrial assets, that we can start seeing the possibilities emerge for inducing a loss of
1153.68s - 1158.48s |  view, the ability to monitor and extract information from these environments for the
1158.48s - 1164.00s |  purpose of determining are they operating in the way that we want them to, and are they
1164.00s - 1169.76s |  doing their job safely, efficiently, etc., but also potentially and more worryingly a loss of control
1169.76s - 1174.64s |  where we get into a scenario not whether I can start a process, but rather can I stop it if that
1174.64s - 1181.12s |  process starts deviating from safe or desirable parameters for its overall functionality.
1182.00s - 1186.88s |  So, in looking at this, what risks are we talking about and what considerations are involved in this
1186.88s - 1191.20s |  discussion? Well, first, you know, we could make the argument, well, why not just turn back the
1191.20s - 1195.68s |  clock? And I've seen people say this, you know, why not just air gap all the important control
1195.68s - 1200.72s |  systems? Well, that'd be really hard, really expensive, and I don't think anyone really
1200.72s - 1205.20s |  expects that we could realistically do this at this point. That ship has sailed and it probably
1205.20s - 1210.56s |  sailed a very, very long time ago, and looking at things like the type of energy mix that we need
1210.56s - 1215.60s |  for the future, as well as increasingly ambitious things like oil and gas exploration and mining
1215.60s - 1222.64s |  operations, we're going to need these sorts of non-wired, over-the-air, and distributed
1222.64s - 1228.48s |  communication environments to tie all these assets into centralized data retrieval, monitoring,
1228.48s - 1232.96s |  maintenance, and control in order for them to be effective. So, we're not able to turn back
1232.96s - 1238.88s |  the clock. We can't just say wire all the things together, bury, you know, 7,000 kilometers worth
1238.88s - 1243.04s |  of dedicated fiber to tie all these things together is just not a realistic option at this
1243.04s - 1249.12s |  point, unless everyone's willing to pay a lot more for a lot of these services that are enabled by
1249.12s - 1253.92s |  the various infrastructure sectors. So, instead, we need to acknowledge reality, that remote
1253.92s - 1260.16s |  connectivity and especially management of critical assets is a fact of existence right now. However,
1260.16s - 1263.68s |  in doing so, that doesn't mean that we just need to throw our hands up and say, well, okay,
1263.68s - 1268.40s |  I accept the risk and bad things are going to happen. There are ways that we can and must do
1268.40s - 1273.76s |  these sorts of items safely, securely, but also redundantly to ensure that we have the sort of
1275.04s - 1278.56s |  resiliency built in to allow these operations to continue.
1279.76s - 1284.64s |  So, in a very simplified way, we can break this down in terms of OT remote operations between
1284.64s - 1289.36s |  security considerations and reliability considerations. From a security standpoint,
1289.36s - 1294.56s |  you know, availability, if we talk our classic confidentiality, integrity, availability triad,
1294.56s - 1298.00s |  we're not going to really worry about availability right now. We're going to assume availability has
1298.00s - 1303.20s |  to be there and we're going to work our damnedest to ensure it, and that is where reliability comes
1303.20s - 1308.00s |  into play. But for ComSec or communication security considerations, we're really talking
1308.00s - 1312.56s |  about ensuring the integrity of those communications, which can be as simple as ensuring that
1312.56s - 1319.12s |  we're doing a robust checksums applied to controls that are communicated over insecure networks.
1319.76s - 1323.52s |  You know, if we're talking about a satellite downlink or wireless communications,
1323.52s - 1328.40s |  some of these links, as you can probably tell from other talks that have taken place at DEF CON's
1328.40s - 1332.96s |  past and present, have emphasized the insecurity of some of these links and how they can be both
1332.96s - 1338.32s |  eavesdropped upon as well as potentially injected into or otherwise subverted for malicious purposes.
1338.32s - 1343.20s |  So, being able to verify the integrity of commands that are sent over these links is vital and
1343.20s - 1348.80s |  something that we need to start pursuing or layering on top of existing industrial control
1348.80s - 1353.92s |  protocols and similar to make that happen. Confidentiality may be part of this. You could
1353.92s - 1358.64s |  argue, well, why not just encrypt all of these items? That might work. There is debate as to
1358.64s - 1363.84s |  how useful or how effective that would be because encryption adds overhead and potential latency in
1363.84s - 1368.16s |  terms of how these commands get passed and processed. And as we start talking about pretty
1368.16s - 1373.52s |  thin pipes like remote satellite communication links and so forth and potential latency issues
1373.52s - 1378.48s |  that surround that, it might not be desirable. But it is something that, especially when it comes to
1378.48s - 1383.20s |  OT or ICS-related protocols, that needs to be considered more strongly instead of just throwing
1383.20s - 1388.16s |  up our hands in the air and saying, well, this is hard, so let's not do it. From a reliability
1388.16s - 1392.40s |  standpoint, yes, it is cheap and easy just to try to wire things together with commercial satellite
1392.40s - 1396.96s |  modems and so forth and call it good. But if we're talking about critical assets that feed into
1396.96s - 1402.56s |  national critical infrastructure, we need to have something more or build in the correct ways of
1402.56s - 1406.80s |  ensuring those operations can be sustained in a challenging environment, whether that be because
1406.80s - 1411.04s |  a satellite constellation gets knocked out by an anti-satellite missile or something along those
1411.04s - 1416.56s |  lines or similar wild scenarios, or something like we saw with the KASAT event with the distributed
1416.56s - 1422.08s |  denial of service mechanism that was used in parallel with the acid rain wiper that was
1422.08s - 1426.72s |  causing significant degradation to that network. How do we operate in a way that if this link is
1426.72s - 1432.88s |  removed, that we have a backup link or a way of securely and safely winding down operations until
1432.88s - 1437.68s |  those links can be restored? That's going to cost a little bit of money, unfortunately, but if we want
1437.68s - 1444.08s |  to reap the rewards of having the flexibility created by these sorts of environments, we need
1444.08s - 1449.36s |  to ensure that we're also doing so in a way that is maintainable and sustainable in realistic fashion.
1450.40s - 1454.48s |  It also means, and this is where we come to DEF CON and most of the audience here,
1454.48s - 1459.28s |  offensive security testing has a role to play here, validating communications and how they work,
1459.28s - 1464.40s |  especially from an adversary's mindset and in the eyes of disruption, is critical, which means
1464.40s - 1469.28s |  offensive testing, which could be anything from tabletop exercises that run through like, oh wait,
1469.28s - 1473.76s |  if that goes away, what do we actually do, to validating that certain networks can be reached
1473.76s - 1478.24s |  or interacted with through over-the-air links and thus demonstrating risk to decision makers that,
1478.24s - 1483.12s |  oh wait a minute, this is not a notional problem but actually can manifest, can allow asset owners
1483.12s - 1488.80s |  to deploy well, evaluating what risk propositions are available. And this gets into a variety of
1488.80s - 1493.20s |  disciplines that become very interesting very quickly in terms of what we can do to test and
1493.20s - 1498.32s |  validate how these networks are deployed and how they function. In terms of additional considerations,
1498.32s - 1502.24s |  there are other things that we need to worry about, and we only have a short period of time here,
1502.24s - 1506.16s |  but I'll have a link to some resources if you want to look a little bit further, that we do
1506.16s - 1510.96s |  have the possibility of physical attacks and disruptions on remote links, insecure protocols
1510.96s - 1514.64s |  that are used over the air, which I talked about a little bit already, as well as latency and
1514.64s - 1518.96s |  observability concerns that come about with communications that start getting pushed into
1518.96s - 1525.20s |  more extreme and more interesting arenas. But overall, the central point or thesis behind this
1525.20s - 1530.16s |  is that we're in a state where we've extended attack surface but haven't really validated how
1530.16s - 1534.64s |  we will operate securely and safely in that new environment as effectively as I think that we
1534.64s - 1539.20s |  should. And these are considerations that asset owners need to keep in mind. So I don't think we
1539.20s - 1543.92s |  have much time for questions, but before I get back to that slide, if anyone wants to snap a
1543.92s - 1547.28s |  picture of this or these slides will be available on the media server, I believe,
1547.28s - 1551.04s |  just a couple of links to articles and some of the things I talked about. But also, if you're
1551.04s - 1555.20s |  really interested in a deep dive into one particular event on this, I'll be presenting
1555.20s - 1559.68s |  at length, including a very lengthy paper at the Virus Bulletin Conference later this year on the
1559.68s - 1564.32s |  KASAT incident. That'll get published in October, so bookmark this if you're interested and really
1564.32s - 1568.64s |  want to explore the nuts and bolts of what not just an attack scenario looks like in this regard,
1568.64s - 1573.44s |  but also what defensive options exist when it comes to doing this sort of activity.
1573.44s - 1578.16s |  So that's forthcoming, and certainly look out for that if you are interested. Otherwise,
1578.88s - 1582.96s |  there's my information. So happy to answer questions. I know we got a quick turnaround
1582.96s - 1587.76s |  time here, so I will hang out probably in the back of the room so that our next speaker can get ready.
1587.76s - 1591.68s |  And yeah, I'm good to go. Thanks, everyone, for hanging out.
