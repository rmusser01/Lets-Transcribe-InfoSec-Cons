**Introduction to GenAI and Vector Encryption**
- Adoption of **GenAI tools** has increased, but security measures have lagged.
- **New data classes**, especially vector data, are entering untested data stores.
- **Vector databases** lack intrinsic security and can be susceptible to **embedding inversion attacks**.
- **Vector encryption** offers privacy-preserving searches over encrypted vectors.

**Limitations of LLMs**
- LLMs predict plausible completions to prompts, which may not always be accurate.
- They are often trained on stale data due to the lengthy training process.
- LLMs are not typically trained on specific corporate or personal data.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** helps fill gaps by incorporating additional information into prompts.

**Vector Search and Databases**
- **AI search techniques** like vector search differentiate word meanings and understand context.
- Vector search works by converting input documents into **vector embeddings**.
- **Vector databases** perform nearest neighbor searches quickly and efficiently.
- Traditional databases are incorporating vector capabilities.

**Security Concerns and Inversion Attacks**
- Top SaaS and security companies are integrating LLM capabilities with private data.
- Vectors can be reversed to reveal the original data using **inversion models**.
- **Vector database companies** currently have immature security measures.
- Vectors in databases are treasure troves of information, posing security risks.

**Encrypting Vectors for Security**
- **Homomorphic encryption** (fully and partially) can protect vectors.
- **Partially homomorphic encryption** optimizes nearest neighbor search operations.
- **Distance comparison preserving encryption** allows vector databases to function on encrypted vectors.
- Trade-offs exist between security and the accuracy of queries.

**Implementation and Open Source Solutions**
- Encryption can be added to existing systems with minimal changes.
- **IronCoreAlloy**, an open-source library, helps implement vector encryption.
- The library supports integration with various vector databases and programming languages.
- Encryption introduces negligible performance penalties while preserving search accuracy.

**Conclusion and Recommendations**
- Use of AI and LLMs leads to multiple data copies, increasing security risks.
- **Vector databases** can be vulnerable to inversion attacks, equating to having access to the original data.
- Implementing vector encryption is feasible with available open-source solutions.
- Encrypting vectors containing sensitive data is recommended to enhance security.
