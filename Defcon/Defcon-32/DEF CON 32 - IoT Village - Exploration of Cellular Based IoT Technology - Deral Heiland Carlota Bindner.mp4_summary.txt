## Introduction
- **Deral Heiland** and **Carlotta Bindner** present their research on NB-IoT and LTE-M devices.

## NB-IoT and LTE-M Protocols
- **NB-IoT** (Narrow Band IoT) is characterized by:
    - Relatively low download and upload speeds
    - Support for half-duplex communication only
    - Designed for IoT devices with remote or battery-powered deployment
- **LTE-M** (Machine Type Communication) offers:
    - Higher speeds than NB-IoT
    - Support for full-duplex communication
    - Suitable for transferring large amounts of data, e.g., video and audio
- Both protocols have been developed for IoT and have been enhanced for efficiency and 5G support.

## Interacting with Hardware
- **Circuit board analysis**:
    - Overlaying images of both sides of the board helps understand component placement.
    - Identifying key areas like serial and USB comms is crucial for access points.
    - Acupuncture needles can be used to engage communications without damaging the board.

## AT Commands
- **AT commands** are used for debugging and configuring cellular modems.
- Categories of AT commands:
    - **Test**: Provides a help menu and parameter information.
    - **Read**: Returns current values and configurations.
    - **Write**: Performs configurations based on test and read results.
    - **Execute**: Triggers specific actions on the cellular module.
- **AT manuals** from manufacturers provide detailed information on standard and custom AT commands.

## Communication Methods
- **UART** (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter):
    - Used for debugging, with limited input capability.
    - Primary use case is interchip communication between the cellular module and CPU.
- **USB** (Universal Serial Bus):
    - Commonly used for AT commands and data transfer.
    - Tools like the **Beagle 480** can capture USB traffic in-circuit.

## Serial Communication
- Interchip UART communication between the cellular module and CPU requires two separate lines:
    - One for the CPU to transmit and the cellular module to receive.
    - Another for the cellular module to transmit and the CPU to receive.
- To inject AT commands, the connections between the CPU and cellular module must be severed, and a single FTDI-to-USB device can be used for communication.

## Injected Targeted Attacks
- **Port scanning**:
    - By opening and closing sockets using AT commands, the device can be used to scan ports on back-end systems.
    - This demonstrates the potential to control the device and establish connections to trusted areas.
- **Private APNs**:
    - Devices using private APNs can be used to access and test otherwise secure back-end systems.
    - Interchip communication and control allow testers to assess the overall ecosystem effectively.
