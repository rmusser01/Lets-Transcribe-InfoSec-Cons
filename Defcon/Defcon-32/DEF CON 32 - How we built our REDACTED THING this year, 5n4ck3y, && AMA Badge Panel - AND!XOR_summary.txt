**Introduction**
- Discussion about building the **Anodic Sower Badge** for DEF CON 32
- Emphasis on community interaction and questions from the audience
- Mention of past challenges with **hardware hacking** and **badge design**

**Anodic Sower Badge Design and Challenges**
- **Badge Design**: Anodic Zor, nine years of badge making
- **Challenges**: Reverse engineering snack machines, mic issues
- **Community Engagement**: Treating the presentation as a town hall for audience interaction
- **Badge Building**: Learning new skills, overclocking the RP2040

**Badge Features**
- **Doom Gameplay**: Badge plays Doom, nostalgic design resembling a handheld device
- **Firmware Development**: Use of C programming language, custom drivers for control API
- **Visual Effects**: LEDs indicating status during gameplay (e.g., red for getting shot)
- **Battery Usage**: Transition to lithium for power, challenges with battery design

**Technical Details**
- **Hardware Iterations**: Progression from rev 1 to rev 4, artwork differences
