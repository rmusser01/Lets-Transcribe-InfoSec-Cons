**MicroPython Overview**
- **MicroPython** is a firmware environment for microcontrollers.
- **Applications**: Industrial, scientific, and DEF CON #badgelife projects.
- **Benefits**: Easy for rapid prototyping.

**Challenges in Reverse Engineering**
- **Obstacles**: Compiled bytecode language isn't compatible with existing tools.
- **Frozen Modules**: Compiled directly into firmware, hard to locate and parse.

**Reverse Engineering Process**
- **Tools**: Ghidra disassembler used to identify frozen modules.
- **Data Structures**: Focus on module, string, object, and raw code data structures.
- **Objective**: Rebuild non-frozen modules and understand compiled bytecode.

**MicroPython Specifics**
- **Implementation**: Not a port of CPython, re-implemented from scratch.
- **Environment**: Optimized for microcontrollers with limited resources.
- **Libraries**: Subset of Python standard libraries, with additional MicroPython-only libraries.
- **REPL**: Allows interactive coding similar to Python on desktop systems.

**Use Cases and Limitations**
- **Common Use**: Not in typical consumer products, but in scientific and industrial applications.
- **Frozen Modules**: Used to embed code into firmware, not stored as standalone files.
- **Security**: No inherent vulnerabilities in MicroPython, but reverse engineering can expose code.

**Code Management in MicroPython**
- **Options**: Plain text files, pre-compiled bytecode, or frozen modules.
- **Frozen Modules**: Remove metadata to obscure code, used in CTFs for obfuscation.

**Reverse Engineering Challenges**
- **Tools**: Lack of existing tools for frozen modules, necessitating custom approaches.
- **Protection**: Obfuscation used to hide secrets in frozen modules, but not foolproof.

**Practical Steps for Reverse Engineering**
- **Firmware Image Extraction**: Out of scope, varies by microcontroller.
- **Pico Tools**: Used for demonstration with Raspberry Pi Pico.

**MicroPython Module Analysis**
- **MPY Tool**: Analyzes and disassembles MPY files.
- **Bytecode Differences**: Unique to MicroPython, not compatible with CPython tools.

**Reconstructing Frozen Modules**
- **Header**: Standard across MPY files, starts with magic letter 'M'.
- **Data Structures**: Use VU ints for variably encoded integers.
- **Bytecode**: Parsed recursively, challenges in determining length.

**Conclusion and Recommendations**
- **Reverse Engineering**: More complex than compiled C, but possible.
- **Frozen Modules**: Useful for efficiency, not for security.
- **Advice**: Use Ghidra for exploration, not suitable for hiding secrets.
