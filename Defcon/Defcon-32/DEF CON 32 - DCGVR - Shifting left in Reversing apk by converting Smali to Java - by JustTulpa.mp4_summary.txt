**Presentation Details**
- Title: DEF CON 32 - DCGVR - Shifting Left in Reversing APK by Converting Smali to Java
- Presenter: Jess Tulpa from DC9111 in New Delhi, India
- Focus: Converting **Smali** to **Java**

**Presenter's Background**
- Pursuing a Master's in **Information Security**
- Interested in **Android security**
- Real name: Ayan Ambesh, also known as Ayan Bash

**Motivation for Converting Smali to Java**
- **JADX**: A Dex to Java decompiler, not 100% error-free
- **Error Issues**: Applications can be obfuscated, leading to inconsistent Java code
- Smali's stability in conversion compared to direct Dex to Java conversion

**Challenges Faced**
- Lack of resources on **Smali**
- Syntax understanding: Smali uses specific notations (e.g., v for void, z for boolean)
- Managing spaces in Smali code
- Regex inconsistencies in handling different **Smali** syntax

**Current Work**
- Converting Smali "Hello World" to Java
- Goal: Convert entire applications from Dex to Smali to Java

**Future Research Goals**
- Develop a tool for Android testing to convert applications to code for better understanding
- Aim to improve the conversion process using Smali, bypassing errors found in **JADX**

**Discussion and Feedback**
- Consideration of using regex to simplify space management in **Smali** code
- Potential development into a security tool for learning and analysis

**Conclusion**
- Presenter open to returning with updates on the progress of research and tool development.
