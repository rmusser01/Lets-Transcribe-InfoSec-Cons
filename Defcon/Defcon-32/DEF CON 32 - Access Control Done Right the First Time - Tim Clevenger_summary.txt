**Introduction to Access Control**

- Presentation by **Tim Clevenger**
- Focuses on proper installation and maintenance of physical access control systems
- Highlights common pitfalls in vendor installations

**Choosing an Access Control System**

- **Mercury Security**: Popular choice for larger vendors
- **Local storage and independent processing**: Benefits of Mercury systems
- **Reflashable firmware**: Allows switching vendors with minimal hardware changes

**System Layout Considerations**

- **Layout options**: Based on facility size and needs
- **Four-door layout example**: Description of access panel and additional door controllers
- **Communication loss**: Risks with door controllers

**Installation Environment**

- **Environmental factors**: Heat, humidity, power, and physical security
- **Accessibility**: Ease of access for maintenance
- **Future-proofing**: Consider future needs and changes

**Wiring Considerations**

- **Ethernet vs. RS-485**: Pros and cons for different distances
- **Voltage drop**: Impact on door locks and solutions like remote power supplies
- **Conduit for security**: Protects wiring from tampering

**Remote and Centralized Installations**

- **Warehouse example**: Long distances and RS-485 usage
- **Office space example**: Centralized panels and future considerations

**Power Supplies and Enclosures**

- **Power specifications**: Importance of batteries and chargers
- **Enclosure security**: Tamper switches and key locks for safety
- **Weatherproof options**: For outdoor installations

**Batteries**

- **Regular replacement**: Every 3-5 years based on environment
- **Battery fail outputs**: For system alerts

**Fire Safety and Regulations**

- **Fail safe vs. fail secure**: Door lock options during system failures
- **Compliance with fire codes**: Includes integration with building fire alarms

**Door Hardware**

- **Types of locks**: Electrified strikes, solenoids, magnetic locks, motorized crash bars
- **Request to exit (Rex) and door contacts**: Ensure proper and secure operation

**Badges and Readers**

- **Badge types**: Prox, I-class, MyFairDesfire
- **Custom badges**: Using HID Corporate 1000 for security
- **Reader communication**: Use OSDP to avoid compromises

**Best Practices and Maintenance**

- **Regular testing and alerts**: Ensure system functionality
- **Documentation**: Keep records of installations and maintenance
- **User audits**: Regular reviews of access lists

**Conclusion**

- Invitation to **Physical Security Village** for further discussion and learning
- Encouragement to apply best practices for secure access control systems
