 Anthony the stage is yours. Okay oh shit not again. All right good afternoon whoa
23.57s - 28.77s |  yeah there we go I should be quieter okay good afternoon and welcome to it
28.77s - 33.07s |  you made it you're still around you're still alive thank God do you know where
33.07s - 37.97s |  you were 24 years ago I know where I was because I've got photographic proof I
37.97s - 43.77s |  was at a LAN party living the good life playing action quake 2 on Windows 2000
43.77s - 50.97s |  on 24 diet pepsis I yet I hadn't yet discovered the magic of vodka I also
50.97s - 53.85s |  know where I was seven and a half years ago I was holding the tiniest most
53.85s - 58.53s |  significant piece of evidence that I would ever find in 15 years of criminal
58.53s - 63.97s |  investigations this case I'm going to talk about to say it was unusual for our
63.97s - 67.45s |  little agency is an understatement it would take us all sorts of weird places
67.45s - 72.57s |  like under a killer's car at 3 in the morning outside their house and to an
72.57s - 77.77s |  even more awkward than usual IT office and this isn't so surprising but behind
77.77s - 82.93s |  a keyboard the surprising bit is it was 3,000 hours behind a keyboard and we got
82.93s - 88.69s |  by with a little help from our friend DMX our IP most important part of the
88.69s - 92.17s |  talk is the disclaimer so we're gonna talk first off about trigger warning I'm
92.17s - 94.81s |  gonna talk about violence you're not gonna see crime scene photos or
94.81s - 98.13s |  anything like that but I'm gonna talk about it spoiler alert if you have not
98.13s - 101.81s |  seen the Dateline or the Netflix that covers this case I'm gonna ruin the
101.81s - 105.93s |  ending for you in two minutes these are my personal opinions I'm not
105.93s - 110.81s |  representing my employer it is Sunday I am off duty I'm in my shorts my
110.81s - 118.16s |  duolingo streak is frozen there you go I also happen to love my job and my
118.16s - 122.28s |  streak of not getting sued so please help me continue that here's the agenda
122.28s - 125.52s |  we're pretty much gonna have to gloss over all of this I'm in fact there'll be
125.52s - 130.72s |  no time for questions for sure meet me at the outside after this catch me
130.72s - 134.52s |  outside I guess a reason we won't have time is because we're talking about a
134.52s - 138.84s |  five-year case and when we talk about this to cops we give them a case study
138.84s - 142.88s |  it takes two hours now when you talk to cops you have to talk slower with
142.88s - 148.64s |  smaller words but we're gonna give the 20-minute version here so I do digital
148.64s - 153.48s |  forensics law enforcement digital forensics you might do deeper digital
153.48s - 156.84s |  forensics incident response we are not the same but we have a lot in common
156.84s - 160.24s |  your job's harder because you've got a reverse engineer malware written by
160.24s - 163.92s |  nation-state actors our jobs harder because we've got to get evidence that
163.92s - 167.72s |  our customers don't want to give us and we have to do it lawfully and then prove
167.72s - 171.92s |  later on in court we did it lawfully the theme this year is engaged we're talking
171.92s - 175.84s |  about reversing the insidification of the Internet and probably society at
175.84s - 181.16s |  large for me openness transparency is something we could do with more of
181.16s - 186.28s |  especially in government in general and law enforcement in particular and I'm
186.28s - 201.46s |  not going to use this slide to make subtle political what okay hold up can
201.46s - 212.21s |  you edit this out of the live stream were there slides before that are you
212.21s - 230.63s |  kidding me and you waited this long welcome to the talk okay you heard the
230.63s - 234.07s |  LAN party bit and it was a good joke and you didn't get the visual you heard
234.07s - 241.19s |  smallest piece of evidence weird places were going under a car IT keyboard DMX
241.19s - 248.75s |  come on DMX no wonder I thought I was just I had flop sweat up here anyway you
248.75s - 253.95s |  got the disclaimer you got a bit you got that here's our agenda ignore it and
253.95s - 258.55s |  yeah like I said takes a long time to tell the story to cops we're gonna give
258.55s - 265.67s |  it to you in 20 minutes so defer DF whatever engage of course openness this
265.67s - 267.47s |  is what I was talking about the transparency and I'm not going to use
267.47s - 270.79s |  the slide to make some subtle political point I'm just gonna say we could use
270.79s - 274.23s |  more of it for me forensics is a shining light in this area because law
274.23s - 280.67s |  enforcement forensics we can be be a beacon because because what we do is try
280.67s - 283.39s |  to find the truth of what happened it's not our job to decide whether somebody's
283.39s - 286.75s |  guilty or innocent that's the jury and judges job our job is just to find stuff
286.75s - 289.83s |  and bring it there and in fact we have a duty if we find stuff that says that
289.83s - 293.67s |  defendant is not guilty we have to turn it over or we lose our careers and
293.67s - 297.07s |  possibly go to jail I tried to find a through line in this case and in this
297.07s - 300.07s |  talk I wanted to find one thing to pull out of it so here's what it is I'm not
300.07s - 305.23s |  gonna read a lot of slides you verbatim but victims should be our focus and one
305.23s - 310.83s |  attribute or diagnosis does not define a person our victim in this case is Carrie
310.83s - 315.03s |  Farver she went missing in November of 2012 she's 37 years old has a teenage
315.03s - 319.59s |  son she works as a computer programmer in Omaha Nebraska she lives in Macedonia
319.59s - 324.47s |  Iowa about an hour away she was dating Dave at the time they've been dating
324.47s - 329.27s |  about two weeks and Dave just got out of a long-term relationship with a woman
329.27s - 332.83s |  named Amy Dave and Amy were together 11 years they had two kids didn't get
332.83s - 335.99s |  married he's not looking for commitment anymore he's up front with the women he
335.99s - 340.19s |  dates he says I'm just looking for casual dating and he's getting back and
340.19s - 343.55s |  he hasn't dated since like the Clinton administration so he's getting back on
343.55s - 347.31s |  what do you do you go to plenty of fish calm just like all of you and when you
347.31s - 351.95s |  go to plenty of fish he ends up meeting before he meets Carrie he meets a woman
351.95s - 356.79s |  called Lilith I'm gonna call her Lilith but Lilith's about his age they're
356.79s - 360.67s |  dating and she is looking for a commitment she says that he's up front
360.67s - 364.99s |  with her like everyone else she kind of pushes they end up dating on again off
364.99s - 368.51s |  again now this slide's gonna you're gonna see this and say look at this
368.51s - 372.51s |  egotistical bastard puts a picture of himself on a slide this is from the
372.51s - 376.11s |  Netflix show that's so it's there a because of that B because it is kind of
376.11s - 382.56s |  a cool special effect they did and C because they did me dirty if you open
382.56s - 386.56s |  the Netflix app on your phone you put the word stalker in you probably get my
386.56s - 398.30s |  face lover stalker killer I'm none of these things so we back to Dave's place
398.30s - 401.02s |  Dave lives in Omaha Nebraska he's actually within walking distance of
401.02s - 404.94s |  Carrie's office and so this works out great for two weeks they're dating she's
404.94s - 407.58s |  crashing at his place most of the time because it saves her a two-hour round
407.58s - 412.78s |  trip and this is going well until the 13th of November 2012 Dave works as an
412.78s - 416.26s |  auto mechanic he goes to work a few hours into a shift he gets a text from
416.26s - 420.86s |  Carrie now this is weird because Dave before he could even give his spiel
420.86s - 424.02s |  about casual dating Carrie gave hers and she said look I'm not looking for
424.02s - 428.26s |  anything serious so he gets a text says let's move in together is this is out of
428.26s - 431.54s |  left field he responds I thought we were on the same page and then he gets this
431.54s - 435.74s |  barrage of mean text back saying I hate GMC and someone else whatever he gets
435.74s - 439.94s |  home and finds his apartment there's no trace of Carrie anymore she's taking all
439.94s - 444.10s |  of her stuff he figures he dodged a bullet now we are short on time so we're
444.10s - 448.94s |  gonna have to hack it we're gonna hack time moving ahead for the next three
449.02s - 454.02s |  years Dave and Lilith date on again off again and there's this thing wherever
454.02s - 458.34s |  they start to drift apart text messages come in from Carrie texts and emails and
458.34s - 461.02s |  they say something like I'm watching you and have these stalking photos attached
461.02s - 467.54s |  or there's pictures of vandalism to Lilith's garage or it escalates in 2013
467.54s - 473.54s |  there's a fire set to Lilith's house obvious intentional arson and Carrie
473.54s - 479.58s |  admits to it by email now the Omaha Police Department they get a warrant for
479.58s - 482.74s |  Carrie's arrest because of all these things that are going on meanwhile she's
482.74s - 486.14s |  still a missing person on the Iowa side of the Missouri River and so in our
486.14s - 489.46s |  agency the original investigators go to Carrie's house it looks like somebody
489.46s - 493.82s |  just up and left they didn't plan this thing they also find Carrie's
493.82s - 498.30s |  medications now this clouds the investigation it clouds the investigation
498.30s - 502.78s |  because they find meds for bipolar disorder yes Carrie had struggled with
502.78s - 506.58s |  bipolar disorder in the past she was in a good place though when she went
506.58s - 511.46s |  missing and her life was going pretty well she had her dream job her son's
511.46s - 517.06s |  doing great they saw this and the stigma of mental illness can cloud people's
517.06s - 519.82s |  vision and they thought well this makes sense because these emails and these
519.82s - 522.78s |  texts that come in they say that she's taken off and might have checked into a
522.78s - 526.58s |  hospital or whatever maybe she really is you know on or off on her own accord
526.58s - 530.98s |  this also got muddy because of the jurisdictional issue you've got two
530.98s - 534.14s |  different jurisdictions separated by a river on the west side you've got
534.14s - 538.50s |  Nebraska and there the Omaha Police Department is going after Carrie for all
538.50s - 542.38s |  these harassments and vandalisms and stalking the arson and on the Iowa side
542.38s - 545.22s |  they've got a missing person and there's this confirmation bias that kicks in
545.22s - 548.94s |  because on the Iowa side they are wondering is Carrie still around well
548.94s - 553.42s |  yes look at this pile of police reports the case goes cold in 2014 there's not a
553.42s - 556.78s |  lot of new leads coming in occasionally a text or an email all the IPs are
556.78s - 562.02s |  coming back to VPNs not traceable in 2015 investigator Doty Corporal Avis
562.02s - 566.50s |  and I we revisited this case and so if you haven't figured out from the way
566.50s - 574.10s |  that I look or sound or am I am the nerd at the sheriff's office there I'm a
574.10s - 586.84s |  hacker and I carry a badge and there are dozens of us dozens this is my CV slide
586.84s - 591.32s |  I got to establish my bona fides so I've redacted my original employer up there
591.32s - 597.92s |  but in any case I had a 15 to 17 year sentence in IT I for the last eight
597.92s - 601.88s |  years I was working in our county's IT department and I was moonlighting as a
601.88s - 605.00s |  reserve deputy in our sheriff's office for a dollar a year in fact during this
605.00s - 609.68s |  case I made about three dollars because I'm helping out with digital forensics
609.68s - 613.60s |  and so on so my job now is I do digital forensics cyber investigations I work on
613.60s - 616.88s |  the internet crimes against children task force and ain't do anything else
616.88s - 621.12s |  geeky the sheriff needs this isn't an official part of my CV but one of my
621.12s - 625.48s |  favorite times testifying in federal court I was questioned by the defense
625.48s - 632.43s |  attorney starts his line of questions as deputy Kava you're a wizard Harry
632.43s - 639.67s |  deputy Kava you're an expert in pornography and in that pause I just
639.67s - 647.07s |  said thank you because as I know the sonographer is going to type it down it
647.07s - 652.47s |  goes in the transcript and now I am on the record as a federal porn expert and
652.47s - 659.55s |  my parents are proud yeah also I know it's not as much of an achievement here
659.55s - 665.97s |  when I'm surrounded by 30,000 porn experts I've never given a main stage
665.97s - 669.93s |  talk before I've given talks to some villages shout out to Sky Talks, AppSec
669.93s - 674.65s |  Village, Recon Village, DC 402 our local group in the Colonel Khan Conference I've
674.65s - 678.21s |  been a hacker my whole life though ever since I was a kid late 80s early 90s
678.21s - 681.65s |  dialing bulletin boards reading text files I thought hacker that's me that
681.65s - 685.65s |  makes sense this kid was getting root from his 8086 there on his lap this kid
685.65s - 688.45s |  also is a freaking idiot and didn't understand you could trace modem calls
688.45s - 692.81s |  and so around the time this photo is taken is also the first time but not the
692.81s - 698.53s |  last that I'd be accused of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act but we
698.53s - 701.13s |  don't have time for that that's a different talk so back to the case file
701.13s - 706.49s |  we bring we revisited this cold case and we've got three or four years worth of
706.49s - 709.33s |  history to look at so we're going through all the incidents that have
709.33s - 712.89s |  happened up to here at this point when this start case started out if you'd
712.89s - 715.41s |  look at the digital evidence there were just a few bits here and there but at
715.41s - 719.41s |  this point things have accumulated which helps us out actually Dave has
719.41s - 723.77s |  gotten over ten or twelve thousand fake emails from Carrie I'm gonna have to
723.77s - 727.25s |  fast-forward again this is the ultimate spoiler for you so if you haven't
727.25s - 733.37s |  watched the Netflix show pause go watch the Netflix show come back if you're
733.37s - 738.53s |  here in person you're screwed so here we go you may have already guessed but
738.53s - 743.25s |  here's our spoiler it's Lilith everything all the text the emails the
743.29s - 747.77s |  harassment the stalking the burglaries the arson and probably the murder of
747.77s - 750.65s |  Carrie Farber in fact we're sure the murder of Carrie Farber is all
750.65s - 754.17s |  attributed to Lilith she's been doing all this all along for three years she's
754.17s - 758.77s |  pretended to be Carrie online and things are coming together we're working towards
758.77s - 761.33s |  an arrest warrant but we've got to have our ducks in a row because we can only
761.33s - 764.77s |  we only get one shot at trying her for the murder and we don't have a body so
764.77s - 768.13s |  we've got to find all the evidence we can and then things escalate in December
768.17s - 773.53s |  2015 Lilith is shot in a park next to our sheriff's office and when she's
773.53s - 777.49s |  questioned about it who shot you this time she doesn't blame Carrie like
777.49s - 780.65s |  everything else has been blamed on Carrie she pivots she blames Amy
780.65s - 785.49s |  coincidentally Dave and Amy are just about to move in together and now Amy is
785.49s - 790.85s |  in her sights so that puts us under her car we get a warrant for GPS we're
790.85s - 794.77s |  tracking her car this is an average day on the GPS tracker instead of taking the
794.77s - 798.01s |  straight path to work every day she goes on patrol and checks Dave and Amy's
798.01s - 801.93s |  apartments she's stalking them we bring her in for an interview and for those
801.93s - 808.01s |  of you not from the US cops can lie to you in the US within reason so this is
808.01s - 812.93s |  Dodie brings her in and says look I want to help you and I believe all this
812.93s - 816.89s |  bullshit you're giving us about Amy shooting you so here's the thing if she
816.89s - 821.29s |  would shoot you maybe she also killed Carrie and if you could get us any
821.29s - 825.17s |  evidence on that we'll make a case against Amy and put her in prison and so
825.17s - 829.49s |  surprise surprise within about two days Lilith is getting emails from Amy who's
829.49s - 834.17s |  never emailed her before and she basically Amy basically admits to every
834.17s - 838.45s |  crime that's happened in the Omaha metro area in the last three years based on
838.45s - 840.97s |  that because we've got some new evidence we're able to get warrants for
840.97s - 844.61s |  residences so we hit two residences one of them is Lilith's new place in Persia
844.61s - 849.81s |  Iowa her new apartment the other one is the home of an IT employee at our county
849.81s - 854.89s |  and at the time I'm his boss so that was awkward I'm the guy on the right so
854.89s - 859.05s |  anyway that was awkward we had to go search those places here's Lilith's
859.05s - 863.57s |  place in Persia this is the actual place fun fact used to be a mortuary so we
863.57s - 866.69s |  went in there we did a search warrant we found some good evidence including this
866.69s - 870.25s |  camcorder this camcorder belonged to Carrie Farver it was in Lilith's
870.25s - 874.73s |  bedroom closet everything we have points to this taking place in Omaha
874.73s - 878.61s |  Nebraska that Carrie was killed there and so we are having meetings with the
878.61s - 881.65s |  Omaha Police Department and the Douglas County Attorney's Office in Nebraska to
881.65s - 885.45s |  prosecute this thing in their jurisdiction and what I'm doing is I'm
885.45s - 888.53s |  trying to on the digital side find coincidences I'm trying to tie things
888.53s - 892.93s |  together we want to attribute these confession emails to Lilith but most of
892.93s - 897.85s |  the time she's using a VPN about 1% of time she screws up she has 60 or 80 fake
897.85s - 901.41s |  accounts she's using and we can attribute some of them to her directly
901.41s - 905.29s |  the rest are all VPNs only so what I'm trying to do is find coincidence so we
905.29s - 909.25s |  can tie the VPN traffic to her we've got digital overload with this thing we're
909.25s - 913.33s |  hitting all the places you see listed here and more with subpoenas and search
913.33s - 917.33s |  warrants and that gives us 80 gigs of legal responses now that doesn't sound
917.33s - 920.85s |  like a lot that's just text and then we've got terabytes of physical media
920.85s - 926.09s |  USB sticks hard drives SD cards everything 100,000 emails and texts half
926.09s - 931.13s |  a million IP address records and there is no off-the-shelf Microsoft cold case
931.13s - 935.73s |  homicide that you can throw at this so what what do you do when the going gets
935.73s - 945.02s |  tough the old and bald write Perl and that's what I did so I created a system
945.02s - 949.90s |  I called it Dex it's a MariaDB database it's Perl on on the front end and back
949.90s - 953.78s |  and it called it Dex as an homage to Dexter I think I was watching Dexter at
953.78s - 957.26s |  the time and also because it's an index for this entire case why did I write it
957.26s - 963.46s |  in Perl apart from Perl being the best programming language ever conceived
963.46s - 968.70s |  Perl is custom fucking design for this Perl is made to parse text Perl is
968.70s - 973.50s |  regex native it's beautiful I love it so anyway people watch this and so nerds
973.50s - 976.38s |  on the internet asked why didn't you just like sort the IPs and pick the top
976.38s - 978.46s |  one because if you watch the Netflix documentary it looks like that's what I
978.46s - 981.58s |  could have done well because there's more to it we've got 60 or 80 different
981.58s - 985.14s |  sources of information 60 or 80 different formats plus all the stuff off
985.14s - 989.22s |  these drives anyway I wrote parsers in Perl and I'm looking for four main
989.22s - 993.86s |  things I want dates and times email addresses IP addresses and the context
993.86s - 997.58s |  where I found that stuff that all goes into the Dex database and then at the
997.58s - 1002.06s |  same time I'm collecting OSINT I'm trying to identify some of these IPs and
1002.06s - 1005.46s |  tie them to a VPN provider and so the way I'm doing that is through who is
1005.46s - 1008.82s |  records but that's not complete I'm doing that through DNS that's not
1008.82s - 1012.50s |  complete and then I've got experimental stuff with Perl where I'm actually making
1012.50s - 1017.74s |  connections to these with their client recording the exit node IP and doing it
1017.74s - 1021.94s |  again that all goes into the Dex database I've also got all this media in
1021.94s - 1025.50s |  my lab and so I don't have enough storage space to take a copy of every
1025.50s - 1029.58s |  piece I wish I did so what I started doing is triaging it why how do I triage
1029.58s - 1033.18s |  it I could use something you know a commercial tool but I use strings and
1033.18s - 1037.46s |  XZ and grep why because I can save a nice highly compressed copy of the
1037.46s - 1040.10s |  strings that are in there and I can look for the thing I need which is basically
1040.10s - 1044.94s |  the year 2012 or 2013 is there anything from there I'm also using an open source
1044.94s - 1048.66s |  tool called scalpel for recovering deleted stuff for carving files they
1048.66s - 1051.86s |  have this cool preview mode where I can just record all the offsets of where the
1051.86s - 1055.34s |  deleted stuff is without having to do it so you can look at the Netflix
1055.34s - 1058.10s |  documentary you see this that's how it gets there though it's a lot of work
1058.10s - 1063.26s |  goes into it I did end up on our master hacker which is kind of a what do you
1063.26s - 1067.50s |  call it bucket list item for me anyway that's I just want to tell you that is
1067.50s - 1071.94s |  movie magic this is not my office this is not my computer this is not my
1071.94s - 1076.70s |  beautiful house this is the the set that they used and yes it's movie magic to
1076.70s - 1080.22s |  explain it why didn't I use expensive commercial forensic tools I have access
1080.22s - 1083.78s |  to some of them first off they crash all the time now I want to point out how
1083.78s - 1087.50s |  classy this presentation is I could have done a CrowdStrike joke here but this is
1087.50s - 1096.10s |  a classy presentation and we are not going to do that these commercial
1096.10s - 1099.62s |  forensic tools they don't have save points either so you can't pick up where
1099.62s - 1103.42s |  you left off they're like they're like two out of three of my wives I liked
1103.42s - 1109.34s |  them I couldn't trust them so I use Dex Dex lets me reinvent the wheel if you
1109.34s - 1112.90s |  write pearl that's what you do it's resilient if it messes up it can pick up
1112.90s - 1115.82s |  where left off it's fast because it's minimalist I just go after those four
1115.82s - 1118.70s |  fields that's it it's cheap it's open-source software and my time is
1118.70s - 1122.90s |  worthless so what if you're too poor to store all the stuff you're trying to
1122.90s - 1126.26s |  carve well I wrote something for that too nobody's ever started on github I
1126.26s - 1131.26s |  I've been using it for seven years it helps me so anyway back to the case so
1131.26s - 1134.30s |  I'm doing all the forensic stuff writing the longest report I've ever written
1134.30s - 1139.18s |  turning that into a thousand slide demonstrative exhibit for court and
1139.30s - 1143.74s |  here's my secret when I go to testify and even before I talk today besides the
1143.74s - 1149.18s |  five shots of espresso and whatever the hell that was I listened to DMX to get
1149.18s - 1153.78s |  in the right mindset just one more thing we went and talked to Dave again Avis
1153.78s - 1156.66s |  and I interviewed him three months before the trial and when we interviewed
1156.66s - 1159.62s |  him we've asked him every time we talked to him thousand times do you have any
1159.62s - 1162.30s |  more electronics from back then he always says no I pulled the one
1162.30s - 1166.46s |  interview technique I know a Columbo and I turned around said just one more thing
1166.50s - 1168.98s |  before we left do you have any electronics he says oh you know what I
1168.98s - 1172.54s |  found this tablet actually you want to take a look at it yes please take a look
1172.54s - 1176.74s |  at the tablet tablets boring but it's got this micro SD card in it the SD card
1176.74s - 1182.14s |  it was format in 2014 but it has tens of thousands of JPEGs on it deleted over
1182.14s - 1185.90s |  400 of them are bit-for-bit matches the hash values match a phone dump the
1185.90s - 1189.18s |  original investigators did in 2013 of Lilith's phone plus her phone serial
1189.18s - 1192.62s |  number is in the Android logs that I get out of it it also has the best evidence
1192.74s - 1197.90s |  we're gonna find this case they're this size 296 pixel images and one 200 pixel
1197.90s - 1201.26s |  image I'm not going to show you the actual images because of what they what
1201.26s - 1203.78s |  they have in them but I'm going to show you just an example so here's a full
1203.78s - 1207.74s |  resolution image when you go down to 200 pixels that in sepia tone you still get
1207.74s - 1213.22s |  pretty good detail and a 96 pixel same thing these pictures they show a body in
1213.22s - 1216.54s |  a state of decomposition and there's enough detail that you can tell that and
1216.54s - 1221.34s |  what's more they have tattoos visible that we know Carrie Farver had we do not
1221.38s - 1225.82s |  find Carrie Farver's body but we know Lilith took pictures of it after she was
1225.82s - 1233.02s |  dead this is the best evidence we're gonna find it's the it's the smoking gun
1233.02s - 1237.54s |  in this case so where does that get us it gets us to a guilty verdict and she
1237.54s - 1240.62s |  gets life in prison for the murder plus 20 years on the arson I don't know if
1240.62s - 1244.86s |  you can ever actually bring closure to a family in these kind of cases but we
1244.86s - 1246.98s |  were able to get them some answers and that meant that they could have a
1246.98s - 1249.90s |  celebration of life ceremony and we got them a little bit of justice so I'm very
1249.90s - 1254.86s |  proud of that we also this pisses me off on these cases like this the killers
1254.86s - 1258.14s |  are always the focus if you google Carrie Farver's name you immediately
1258.14s - 1261.62s |  find a picture of the person who harmed her and so Dodie Avis and I want to do
1261.62s - 1264.66s |  something positive in her name so we started a scholarship at the community
1264.66s - 1267.78s |  college she attended it's for IT students like her I know all of you lost
1267.78s - 1271.54s |  your money on slots last night or whatever but if you have a rich uncle or
1271.54s - 1275.46s |  aunt tell them to go Farber scholarship org give something if not if you don't
1275.46s - 1279.10s |  have money just remember the victims always remember the victims remember
1279.10s - 1283.98s |  Carrie Farver not her killer and this has been a dream come true for me I've
1283.98s - 1289.26s |  wanted to give a DEF CON main talk for 15 or 20 years and I had one goal
1289.26s - 1292.78s |  leading up here was to do that now I have a new goal and that is to give a
1292.78s - 1306.95s |  longer DEF CON talk thank you thanks everyone see me see me in the hallway
1306.95s - 1311.59s |  after for questions and I even have these nifty little cards that I'll give
1311.59s - 1315.11s |  you they're great thank you
