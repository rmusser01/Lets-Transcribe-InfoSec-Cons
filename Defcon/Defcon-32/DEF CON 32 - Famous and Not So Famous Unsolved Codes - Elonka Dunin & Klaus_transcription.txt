 Welcome, everyone. Today, our last day of DEF CON, congratulations on surviving.
8.24s - 16.16s |  We're going to be talking about famous and not so famous unsolved codes. So I am Ilan Kadunin,
16.16s - 22.00s |  and I am a game developer and a crypto authority and a book author and...
22.56s - 28.48s |  Hello, I'm Klaus Schmee. I'm a German IT security expert, crypto expert,
28.48s - 34.56s |  crypto history expert and book author. Right. And together, we wrote a couple books,
35.28s - 42.32s |  one of which is Codebreaking, a practical guide, which I believe is sold out in the vendor hall
42.32s - 47.52s |  right now. They might have like one copy left. And it came out in September of last year. So
47.52s - 53.28s |  we're going to be going through a very small number of unsolved encrypted messages,
54.16s - 65.66s |  starting with one of my favorites. Cryptos. This is Langley, Virginia, CIA headquarters.
66.22s - 72.22s |  And that white building with the funny shaped roof is the cafeteria. And outside the windows
72.22s - 79.02s |  of the cafeteria, there is a green landscaped area with a sculpture called Cryptos. It was
80.62s - 89.58s |  commissioned in 1988, installed in 1990. And it has an encrypted inscription on it. And there are
89.58s - 99.74s |  four parts. So the sculptor was or is Jim Sanborn. And the designer of the ciphers on it is Ed Scheidt.
100.46s - 109.90s |  I've met both of them. Jim Sanborn, no public list of his works really existed until I started
109.90s - 115.50s |  making one around 2003. And then he kind of called me up and he said, Who are you? And why do you
115.50s - 123.02s |  have a web page about me? And I explained that I was a big fan. And now we're getting along much
123.02s - 131.34s |  better. And Ed Scheidt, also he's listed as the retired chairman of a CIA cryptographic center.
131.90s - 139.18s |  There is no CIA cryptographic center, but he is. He's a spook. Okay. He's been involved with the
139.18s - 146.14s |  CIA for a long time. So the inscription, I won't go into great detail about how these are made.
146.14s - 154.70s |  We kind of number them K1 through K4. And we solved the first three parts. The fourth part
154.70s - 160.54s |  has not been solved yet. So it is one of the most famous unsolved codes in the world. And
160.54s - 168.54s |  Sanborn has actually given us some clues about it. He gave us the clue that in 2010,
169.18s - 176.14s |  that starting at the 64th character, there is the word Berlin. And after that, we have the word
176.70s - 183.10s |  clock. So there's been a lot of research done on clocks in Berlin. And then in January 2020,
183.10s - 188.38s |  he gave us another clue, the word Northeast. And then the pandemic started and he kind of wanted
188.38s - 195.34s |  to stir things up. And so he gave another clue, which is the word East. So it's kind of embarrassing
195.34s - 202.46s |  now because we have a big chunk of what is supposedly the deciphered text, and we still
202.46s - 210.70s |  don't know what it says. So the cryptos I should also mention is a big part of a book by Dan Brown,
210.70s - 217.82s |  who wrote the book, The Da Vinci Code in 2003, which and this sequel, The Lost Symbol takes
217.82s - 226.30s |  place in Washington, DC, published in 2009. And it does feature both cryptos and Freemasons as
226.30s - 233.42s |  recurring themes. And in the book, there is a character named Nola K, which he put in there,
233.42s - 239.98s |  he named after me. So it's sort of a scrambled version of my name there, because I helped him
239.98s - 246.46s |  with some of the research for the book. So why hasn't K4 been solved yet? Well, it's short,
246.46s - 255.58s |  it's just 97 characters. So it's very difficult. There may be a key that is only accessible on CIA
255.58s - 263.26s |  grounds, we might have missed something, we might have been misdirected. And he may have messed it
263.26s - 270.94s |  up, there might be a mistake that makes it unsolvable. So we have it on our list here as
271.50s - 273.42s |  an unsolved cryptomystery.
275.74s - 282.94s |  Okay, let's now come to the next cryptomystery, the so called de Bosnian cryptograms. Well, this
282.94s - 292.86s |  story takes us to the year 1882. And it takes place in New York State. Well, honestly, there
292.86s - 300.78s |  are not many pictures about this story. So I created a couple of pictures myself. I use Lego
300.78s - 311.34s |  for it. So the story takes place in Essex County, New York. And in the year 1882, a stranger came
311.34s - 320.14s |  to this place. His name was Henry de Bosnius. And after only a few weeks, he started courting
320.14s - 329.26s |  a widow who lived in this area. Her name was Elizabeth Wells. And after only a few weeks later,
329.98s - 336.54s |  the two married. So all this went pretty fast. And it was all already Henry de Bosnius third
336.54s - 344.94s |  marriage. His first two wives had died pretty early after the wedding. Now, he had found a
344.94s - 350.86s |  third wife. But again, the marriage didn't last very long because after only about five weeks or
350.86s - 361.34s |  so, his wife was found dead. She was both stabbed and shot. And well, it's no wonder that
361.34s - 367.50s |  Henry de Bosnius became the prime suspect. And all the events I told you about took place within
367.50s - 374.38s |  a very short timeframe. On May the 1st, Henry de Bosnius came to Essex County. Only five weeks
374.38s - 382.46s |  later, he married. And seven weeks later, his wife was murdered. And as I said, Henry de Bosnius
382.46s - 391.82s |  became the prime suspect. He was arrested, put into jail. And while he was in jail, he wrote a
391.82s - 398.78s |  couple of poems, a couple of other texts. He drew a few pictures. Apparently, he was quite good at
398.78s - 405.42s |  things like that. He knew a lot about literature. He spoke several languages. And he also was a
405.42s - 413.98s |  good artist. And in addition, he created a couple of encrypted messages. I will come back to this
413.98s - 425.42s |  later. Well, then he was put on trial. The trial started on January 20th, 1883. It ended with a
425.42s - 432.62s |  verdict. He was condemned to death on April 16th. And well, there's an interesting story about this.
433.50s - 441.42s |  Before he died, or before he went to execution, he sold his body to a local physician who could
441.42s - 449.02s |  use it for scientific experiments. And with the money he gained, he bought himself a suit so
449.98s - 458.06s |  he could die in a nice suit. And apparently, that was important to him. Well, he was hanged.
458.78s - 465.98s |  And as you can see here, he was hanged in his nice suit he had purchased with the money he had made.
465.98s - 474.14s |  And that was on April 27th, 1883. And somehow, well, as I said, he sold his body to a physician.
474.22s - 482.30s |  And somehow, his skull finally made it to a local museum, the Adirondack History Center Museum.
482.30s - 488.94s |  And there it can be seen along with the hangman's rope that was used. Well, this is certainly an
488.94s - 495.50s |  interesting case with a couple of open questions. For example, the first question, of course, is
495.50s - 502.86s |  was Henry de Bosnitz really guilty? Well, he probably was. He always denied being the murderer
502.86s - 510.70s |  of his wife. But apparently, there was enough evidence to find him guilty. Well, as I said,
510.70s - 517.02s |  his first two wives died pretty early too. So the question is, of course, did he murder them too?
517.74s - 524.46s |  We don't know. And who was he anyway? Because while on trial, he said, well, I'm not really
524.46s - 530.86s |  Henry de Bosnitz. This is only a pseudonym. I'm somebody else. This is not my true identity.
531.42s - 536.94s |  This might have been a lie. But it was not really clear who he really was. And his background was
536.94s - 543.26s |  not really clear. So there are a couple of questions. And maybe these questions could be
543.26s - 551.02s |  answered if it was possible to decipher the encrypted messages he created in jail. Well,
551.02s - 557.74s |  altogether, he created four messages, four cryptograms. As you see here, he also added a
557.74s - 566.06s |  couple of drawings. And as you can also see, these messages contain a lot of different letters.
566.06s - 574.94s |  So the alphabet he used was pretty large. And we have no clue what is written in these notes.
576.30s - 581.26s |  De Bosnitz, he spoke several languages, English, French, Portuguese, Latin, Greek. So it's not
581.26s - 589.42s |  even clear which plain text language he used. Of course, when one tries to solve an encrypted
589.42s - 595.74s |  message of this kind, it's always a good idea to look for crypts. And in this case, there is a
595.74s - 602.06s |  potential crypt. Because what you see here is a poem de Bosnitz wrote while in jail. And this
602.06s - 607.50s |  looks pretty similar as one of his encrypted messages. So maybe there's a one-to-one relationship.
608.46s - 615.90s |  If this really is the case, it would go a long way in solving the mystery. But so far, nobody
615.90s - 625.66s |  has really managed to match the two texts and to make sense of it. So maybe it is not a crypt,
625.66s - 630.38s |  or maybe the correct way to use this crypt hasn't been found yet.
631.26s - 637.74s |  So the message is still undeciphered. And so we are dealing with an unsolved,
637.74s - 642.78s |  more or less unsolved criminal case. And it's also an unsolved crypto mystery.
643.66s - 656.32s |  So next, we're going to go to something I find super interesting. This is from World War Two.
656.40s - 665.84s |  World War Two, a pigeon, a carrier pigeon was found in the chimney of someone in Surrey in
665.84s - 675.60s |  England. He found it in 1982, brought it to public attention and in 2012. So we think that the pigeon
675.60s - 685.76s |  was on its way to RAF Bomber Command in High Wycombe there. And the pigeon carried an encrypted
685.76s - 694.08s |  message. So carrier pigeons very briefly in World War Two were used extensively. There were over
694.08s - 702.72s |  250,000 that were being used. And there was even a special medal that was created for particularly
702.72s - 709.92s |  brave pigeons such as ones that took an injury and still managed to get to their destination.
710.48s - 717.28s |  This was a medal that was also given to other animals, dogs, horses, and even some cats received
717.28s - 725.28s |  it. So here's the message. It was in the and that's actually the the leg of the pigeon and a
725.28s - 733.52s |  red canister there. Red canisters tended to be used either by the United States forces or by the
733.52s - 742.16s |  British Army. And there's the code two, which we know was RAF Bomber Command in High Wycombe. And
742.16s - 748.48s |  these are the identifiers of the two pigeons. This was a message that was sent in duplicate.
749.20s - 759.04s |  The NURP there, N-U-R-P, meant National Union of Racing Pigeons. And then the 40 and 37 were the
759.04s - 767.04s |  years that these particular pigeons were banded. Then these were probably the the homes of the
767.04s - 773.12s |  pigeons where they were hatched and raised and then their number in that particular year.
773.92s - 783.44s |  So the T-W probably means either Twickenham or Tunbridge Wells and the D-K probably means
783.44s - 791.36s |  Dorking. Also we have, so of the numbers there, there's the number six, which would have been
791.36s - 799.92s |  the day of the month, which would tie in with D-Day, June 6, 1944. The time that the form was
799.92s - 806.48s |  filled in, the time that the message was created, and the number of copies sent.
807.92s - 813.68s |  So this section was in different handwriting, was probably filled in by someone else,
813.68s - 820.48s |  probably someone in France, as opposed to someone who was English. And that would tie in with that
820.48s - 828.08s |  word L-I-B, which would mean Libéré, the pigeon was freed at that particular time at 425.
829.04s - 836.24s |  And it was sent by a Sergeant Stott. And research shows that there was a Sergeant William Stott,
836.24s - 843.84s |  he was 27 years old, a paratrooper, and did parachute into occupied Normandy on a reconnaissance
843.84s - 850.24s |  mission on D-Day. So this was probably him sending a message back to home after that.
851.20s - 858.80s |  Now of this message, there are 27 groups of letters, five letters each. And we also know
858.80s - 868.32s |  that this A-O-A-K-N appears twice, both at the beginning and at the end. So what kind of system
868.32s - 874.56s |  might have been used? Well, there's several. It might have been a manual cipher, might have been
875.52s - 882.00s |  a codebook, or an encryption machine, or a one-time pad. There's several kinds of machines
882.00s - 889.76s |  that were used in World War II around the time. So we don't know. And so it is one of the unsolved
889.76s - 900.42s |  mysteries. Yes. And let's now look at another unsolved crypto mystery. This one takes us to
900.42s - 907.94s |  my home country, to Germany. To be more precise, it takes us to Thuringia, which is today one of
907.94s - 916.50s |  the 16 states of Germany. And a couple of years ago, a blog reader of mine contacted me and he
916.50s - 925.14s |  said, well, my family is from Thuringia. And for generations, we have possessed a cigarette case.
926.02s - 933.54s |  And this cigarette case, well, first of all, it bears this two-letter engravement here. These
933.54s - 940.02s |  letters stand for AES, but this is not the important part. In addition, it contains a
940.02s - 948.50s |  dedication, which was probably engraved here, probably not by a professional, but maybe by
948.50s - 955.94s |  the person who used this cigarette case as a gift, as a present for somebody. And apparently,
955.94s - 964.82s |  this dedication is encrypted. You can see it here. We have four lines of unknown symbols.
964.82s - 970.18s |  We have no idea how this can be read, how this can be deciphered. At least it's clear
970.90s - 980.98s |  that the date mentioned here is Christmas Eve, the 24th of December in 1909. And in Germany,
980.98s - 990.34s |  in my home country, Christmas presents are usually given on Christmas Eve. So my suspicion is that
990.34s - 998.18s |  this cigarette case was a Christmas present for somebody. And of course, as I already mentioned,
998.66s - 1002.98s |  when trying to break such an encryption, it's always good to look for crypts.
1002.98s - 1008.26s |  And if this really was a Christmas present, it seems possible that something like
1008.26s - 1015.54s |  Merry Christmas, or in German, Frohe Weihnachten, is included. But this crypt, if it is one,
1015.54s - 1021.94s |  hasn't helped so far. I can't find anything here that looks like Frohe Weihnachten. So
1022.90s - 1029.86s |  in my view, the whole cryptogram is pretty strange. Well, first of all, it's not strange at all.
1030.98s - 1038.50s |  Because there are many encryptions that look like this. Here you have a few on the right side,
1038.50s - 1044.18s |  you have a few encrypted texts from the same time. And I think the similarity is obvious.
1045.06s - 1050.50s |  These encrypted texts from the right side are from encrypted postcards. And it would be no
1050.74s - 1057.54s |  problem to add 100 more here. This is the kind of encryption that was used by people who wrote
1057.54s - 1064.18s |  encrypted postcards or maybe encrypted letters 100 years ago. And almost all of these encryptions
1064.18s - 1071.70s |  can be broken very easily today. So this dedication is an absolute exception because
1071.70s - 1077.06s |  it looks like all the encryptions from this time. But contrary to almost all others,
1077.62s - 1084.74s |  we have no idea how it can be deciphered. So it's something that looks easy,
1084.74s - 1090.50s |  but appears to be very difficult. If you have an idea on how this can be broken,
1091.06s - 1094.82s |  let us know. But so far, this is an unsolved crypto mystery.
1100.29s - 1105.25s |  So here's one when we talk about famous and not so famous. This is one of the famous ones,
1105.97s - 1116.53s |  the Dorabella cryptogram from Worcester. And it was created by the composer Edward Elgar,
1116.53s - 1125.49s |  who is most famous for a piece called Pomp and Circumstance that you've probably heard
1125.49s - 1133.17s |  at graduation ceremonies. He had an interest in puzzles, and even wrote something called the
1133.17s - 1141.33s |  Enigma variations with 14 different sections, each one that was dedicated to a different person.
1145.47s - 1157.15s |  And one of them was a young woman named Dora Penny, who frequently accompanied his family
1157.15s - 1165.39s |  as they traveled around. She was one of his companions. And she later wrote an autobiography
1165.39s - 1174.43s |  called Memories of Variation. And at one point when his family was staying with her family,
1174.43s - 1182.27s |  and his mother sent a thank you note, and he included a small note of his own to Dora,
1182.91s - 1193.95s |  and it was in code. This was in 1897. And she was not able to decrypt it and later printed it
1193.95s - 1200.59s |  in her autobiography, right? And said, if anyone can solve it, I would most appreciate it if you
1200.59s - 1209.07s |  could tell me what it says. But no one was able to. And here it is, well over 100 years later,
1209.07s - 1214.43s |  we still don't know what it says. It looks like a simple substitution cipher.
1215.07s - 1222.75s |  Now, Elgar did write other encrypted messages. We have access to his notes. And, you know,
1222.83s - 1231.23s |  some of them are alphabetical and very similar symbols, but applying them to the Dorabella
1231.23s - 1238.03s |  cryptogram does not really give us anything. So if we take that alphabet and apply it,
1238.03s - 1246.91s |  we get something that is not intelligible. And if we try doing other methods of frequency analysis,
1247.63s - 1254.67s |  that is not intelligible either. We've done frequency analysis and said, well, you know,
1254.67s - 1262.19s |  maybe this one is, you know, the highest frequency one is the letter E and haven't come up with
1262.19s - 1268.67s |  anything there either. We've done other methods. We could, you know, just guessing words,
1268.67s - 1274.91s |  which is difficult because it doesn't really have spaces between the words. And we've tried a
1274.91s - 1280.99s |  technique called hill climbing, but has not come up with anything. The best it has is like
1280.99s - 1290.51s |  now droop beige weeds. So that doesn't seem helpful. And so why do these methods fail?
1291.39s - 1298.11s |  Well, maybe it's not a substitution cipher. Maybe it's some other method entirely,
1298.11s - 1303.71s |  Morse code or something. Maybe these things are meant to indicate musical notes
1304.67s - 1311.87s |  or something musical. Maybe he made a mistake. Maybe he wrote it when he wasn't feeling well
1311.87s - 1318.83s |  or inebriated or something. And so maybe there's a mistake and maybe it was never intended to mean
1318.83s - 1327.95s |  anything, which is unlikely. I mean, she was a friend and there's no reason that he would have
1327.95s - 1334.83s |  sent her a fraudulent message. And maybe the plain text can't be solved because it doesn't
1334.83s - 1341.79s |  have the patterns of English. For example, there's a sentence, do you go to London tomorrow,
1341.79s - 1346.67s |  which would be very difficult to solve. It doesn't have any ease in it. It doesn't
1347.23s - 1353.71s |  match the normal frequencies. So this remains an unsolved message.
1356.82s - 1362.18s |  Let's now come to the next one. This is again one of the not so famous
1363.38s - 1371.38s |  cipher mysteries. You won't find this one in the collection you find on YouTube or in the books
1371.38s - 1377.06s |  that have been published. So this is something not very famous, but very interesting.
1378.42s - 1384.82s |  Well, first of all, let's talk about encrypted postcards. About a hundred years ago in the early
1385.70s - 1391.78s |  20th century, encrypted postcards were very popular. There are literally hundreds of them.
1391.78s - 1397.22s |  I know several people who collect encrypted postcards and I've seen large collections.
1397.22s - 1404.10s |  I've seen series of encrypted postcards. The longest ones are something like 200 postcards
1404.10s - 1411.30s |  written back and forth, usually between lovers. I think 90% of the encrypted postcards I've seen
1411.38s - 1420.02s |  are from men to their lovers. So apparently they contained love messages. So apparently
1420.02s - 1423.38s |  love messages were encrypted quite often a hundred years ago.
1424.10s - 1432.58s |  And here you see two examples. It would be no problem to show many more. Here are two more
1432.58s - 1438.98s |  encrypted postcards. And most of these encrypted postcards are not very difficult to solve.
1439.78s - 1444.66s |  Well, this one is especially easy. If you read it backwards, you get
1445.46s - 1451.38s |  you darling. Of course, most others are not that easy, but still for an experienced code breakers,
1451.38s - 1459.22s |  it's not really a challenge usually. For example, this encrypted message consists of numbers from
1459.38s - 1467.70s |  1 to 25, I think. So probably every number stands for a letter. And in fact,
1468.50s - 1473.14s |  with some frequency analysis and some word guessing, it's not very difficult to find
1473.14s - 1479.14s |  the substitution table. And there's one complication. This message is written from
1479.14s - 1486.42s |  right to left, but that's easy to get because as you see, it's a straight line on the right side.
1486.42s - 1493.70s |  So if you look at it, it's a good guess to assume that it's written from right to left.
1493.70s - 1499.94s |  And again, it's a love message. Baby, I wanted to talk to you so bad. I'm so sorry you did not
1499.94s - 1505.14s |  have time and so on. This is very typical. Most of the encrypted postcards we have looked at
1505.78s - 1513.62s |  have a message of this kind. So as I said, most of the postcard, almost all of them are solved,
1514.18s - 1520.58s |  but there's one, this one exception, which is almost driving me mad because I really
1520.58s - 1526.90s |  have absolutely no idea what to do with this postcard. Well, first of all, it's the oldest
1526.90s - 1534.82s |  one I know. It's from 1873. All other encrypted postcards I've seen so far were written at a later
1534.82s - 1542.02s |  point of time. And well, this is the front side. As you can see here, it was written to a certain
1542.02s - 1550.82s |  Lizzie Furlong. She lived actually near Luton. And this is the rear side. Here's the message
1550.82s - 1559.94s |  written to this Lizzie. It was written from Luton and the sender was a certain George Furlong. And
1559.94s - 1566.50s |  in fact, it was the great, great grandson of George Furlong, who today lives in Canada,
1566.50s - 1572.02s |  who informed me about this postcard. It's in family position for generation and he has
1572.02s - 1577.86s |  absolutely no clue what this message means. He sent it to me and he was hoping I could decipher
1577.86s - 1583.38s |  it or my blog readers could decipher it. But in fact, nobody was successful.
1585.06s - 1591.38s |  Well, if you look at this text here, it looks different from almost all other encrypted
1591.38s - 1598.58s |  postcards. Well, first of all, apparently the writer was fluent. So my guess would be that
1598.58s - 1605.38s |  it's by far not the first time that this person wrote in this script. And this is unusual. Most
1605.38s - 1613.14s |  other postcards look not like the writer was so fluent. And then some of the letters are not
1614.98s - 1620.50s |  all of the letters are in one line, which is also unusual. I don't know if these additional letters
1621.22s - 1629.06s |  are meant as a correction or if it's from the beginning it was supposed to look this way.
1629.06s - 1637.92s |  I have no idea. Usually frequency analysis is a good tool to start
1639.04s - 1643.92s |  analyzing such an encrypted message. But in this case, frequency analysis is really different
1643.92s - 1651.92s |  because it's sometimes different to distinguish between the symbols. So this doesn't help very
1651.92s - 1657.84s |  much. Of course, looking for crypts is always a good idea. And well, my guess would be that
1657.84s - 1664.56s |  this is a month, but I don't know which one and I don't know how to make sense of it.
1665.92s - 1672.48s |  This is probably the name of the recipient, which would be Lizzie. But can you make Lizzie
1672.48s - 1680.24s |  out of these letters? I can't. And finally, here's an underlined word at the top.
1680.24s - 1686.16s |  It's probably not a place because the place Lutent is mentioned in the clear. Basically,
1686.16s - 1692.32s |  I have no idea what it is. So if you would know what would be written at the top of such a message,
1693.28s - 1702.72s |  please let me know. Okay, so I have looked at many hypotheses of what all this could be about.
1702.72s - 1709.92s |  And so far, the best one in my view I found is that it's a phonetic script. Well, as we all know,
1709.92s - 1714.88s |  in the English language, it happens quite often that letter combinations or that the same letter
1714.88s - 1720.96s |  combination is pronounced in a different way or sometimes several letters stand for one
1721.92s - 1728.64s |  sound or sometimes some letters are not pronounced at all. And for this reason,
1728.64s - 1734.64s |  in the 19th century, there were linguists who tried to create phonetic scripts. A phonetic
1734.64s - 1747.44s |  script is a script where every letter corresponds to one sound of the language. And here on the
1747.44s - 1753.20s |  right, you see a few examples, the Shaw alphabet, the Désiré alphabet, and the QuickScript alphabet.
1754.56s - 1760.00s |  I think there is a certain similarity and I wouldn't be surprised if this message had been
1760.00s - 1765.28s |  written in a phonetic script too. But so far, I didn't find a phonetic script that looks like this.
1765.28s - 1772.96s |  So it seems like a good theory, but so far, it has proven to be a dead end.
1772.96s - 1783.44s |  Finally, this is the cover of our book. And as you can see here, the Furlong postcard is one of
1783.44s - 1789.68s |  our favorite unsolved crypto mysteries. And this is why we even mentioned it or we even used it
1789.68s - 1796.40s |  on the cover of our book. So the lines you see here are from the Furlong postcard. So maybe
1796.40s - 1801.28s |  someday somebody will see the cover of the book and we will immediately recognize, well, this is
1801.28s - 1807.84s |  the so-and-so script and he will tell us how all this works. But so far, this hasn't happened.
1808.96s - 1812.56s |  Again, we are dealing with an unsolved crypto mystery.
1816.61s - 1826.14s |  Thank you. So now we're going to talk about something that surely is solvable, which is
1826.14s - 1836.22s |  called Encrypt. And it's from south of the equator in Canberra, where a science museum has
1836.22s - 1844.30s |  a science educator who created this sculpture. You might call it the Southern Cryptos, but he
1844.30s - 1854.70s |  called it Encrypt. And for the anniversary, one of the Canberra founding anniversaries in 2013,
1855.50s - 1864.22s |  he created the sculpture, right? And this is Glenn McIntosh, who's probably one of the number
1864.22s - 1869.98s |  one fans of Encrypt and has a website with lots of information about it.
1871.74s - 1881.66s |  So Encrypt comprises eight pillars. And on these pillars, there are cryptograms of different types.
1881.66s - 1890.70s |  We know that there are at least 16 there, about six of which are solved. Here is an example of
1890.70s - 1899.74s |  one on pillar C. The rings there that you see on the pillar can be turned. So it's clearly
1899.74s - 1907.18s |  indicating something relating to Enigma and the rotors on the Enigma machine. And so you can map
1907.18s - 1914.38s |  out how the different letters are connected to each other. And this is one that is solved,
1914.38s - 1924.22s |  that is on pillar B. So with this narrower portion of pillar B, it's as though you could
1924.22s - 1932.62s |  wrap something around it with a very specific diameter. And this is indicating an old system
1932.62s - 1942.30s |  called a scatale, where you would wrap a piece of leather or papyrus around some sort of a wooden
1942.94s - 1950.86s |  stick and write the message and then unwrap it and send it. And the receiver would have to have
1950.86s - 1959.34s |  a stick of the exact same diameter in order to be able to read the message. And this is the message
1959.34s - 1971.10s |  from pillar B. And here's pillar H, one of the ones that is still unsolved. And if you look at
1971.10s - 1977.34s |  the different letters that are on this metallic pillar, you'll see that certain of the letters,
1977.90s - 1986.78s |  specifically P, L, and V, are a little bit larger than the other letters. We don't know why.
1987.66s - 1995.18s |  We've talked to the artist and he has told us that all of the different puzzles together
1995.98s - 2004.06s |  are connected and some need to be solved before others. And that this particular one
2004.06s - 2009.10s |  is one that will have to wait till towards the end before it can be solved.
2010.06s - 2014.54s |  All right. And all together, there are several unsolved crypto mysteries.
2016.54s - 2023.50s |  Okay. So this is the last chapter now. We are going to look at a few more crypto mysteries
2023.50s - 2030.70s |  in brief now. For example, this is a mystery we found on a Russian website.
2031.98s - 2038.14s |  This takes us to Kaliningrad, which is today a city in Russia. It used to be German until
2039.02s - 2045.82s |  the end of the Second World War. The name was Königsberg. And near Kaliningrad, there's a
2045.82s - 2053.10s |  place or a town named Baltisk. And according to this Russian website we found a couple of years
2053.10s - 2061.10s |  ago, something was found in Baltisk. It was a bottle post. Well, as you can see here, this
2061.10s - 2066.62s |  place is not on the seashore or it is not near water. So it's certainly unusual to find a bottle
2066.62s - 2074.38s |  post there. But it happened next to this house. In 2015, a bottle post was found here.
2075.74s - 2081.90s |  And this is, we don't have a picture of the bottle, but we have a picture of the message.
2081.90s - 2089.58s |  It's the front side and the rear side. And we don't know what this message says.
2089.74s - 2096.54s |  And it's also completely unclear what the purpose or the background of this message is.
2098.54s - 2105.34s |  Our estimation is that it's from the 1950s, more or less, or maybe a little later, maybe a little
2105.34s - 2111.98s |  earlier. And of course, it could be a Cold War dead drop. Maybe it was a message written by a spy
2111.98s - 2120.22s |  or for a spy with an encryption system used by secret services. And maybe somebody put this
2120.22s - 2126.86s |  bottle with this message somewhere there for a spy to pick it up. Would be a possibility. Of
2126.86s - 2133.42s |  course, it would be a spectacular possibility. Maybe it could also be a toy created by a couple
2133.42s - 2138.86s |  of children or something like that. You never know. Of course, it would be interesting to know
2138.86s - 2145.26s |  what the message says. But so far, it's an unsolved crypto mystery. Here's a completely
2145.26s - 2152.30s |  different one, but also very interesting. The man here is Ignatius Polacki, a private detective from
2152.30s - 2160.62s |  London in the 19th century. He was one of the first private detectives known in history. And some
2160.62s - 2166.70s |  people call him the real Sherlock Holmes. It's pretty clear that when Arthur Conan Doyle wrote
2166.70s - 2172.86s |  his Sherlock Holmes stories a few decades later, he clearly had Polacki and maybe a few other real
2172.86s - 2181.18s |  detectives in his mind. So Polacki certainly influenced the criminal literature of the times.
2181.98s - 2190.38s |  And contrary to Sherlock Holmes, Ignatius Polacki published encrypted newspaper advertisements in
2190.38s - 2196.86s |  the times. We actually don't know how many he published, but we know about five or six
2196.86s - 2203.90s |  that contain his name. There might be many more because usually if you publish a secret message
2203.90s - 2208.62s |  on encrypted message, you don't mention your name. But in some cases, he apparently did.
2209.66s - 2216.46s |  This one is more a code message. Turkeys are in gangs, eagles fly alone. We have no idea what
2216.46s - 2223.66s |  this sentence means, and it will be pretty difficult to find out. Here we have a few more,
2223.66s - 2228.06s |  and these are not code messages, but really encrypted messages, cipher messages.
2229.50s - 2234.94s |  You see in all of these messages, the name Polacki is mentioned, sometimes including the
2234.94s - 2243.58s |  address. And honestly, we have no clue how these messages can be deciphered. So Polacki might have
2243.58s - 2250.46s |  used a code book. So it could be possible to decipher the messages if we find the code book he
2250.46s - 2256.22s |  used. But it looks difficult because even if he used a code book, he might have used super
2256.22s - 2263.74s |  encryptions or an additional encryption. Very difficult. So these are clearly unsolved crypto
2263.74s - 2271.10s |  mysteries, but very hard one. Or if you look at the lower one, he uses symbols. I've never seen
2271.74s - 2277.58s |  symbols like these before. And in my view, they're pretty complicated to encrypt something. You don't
2277.58s - 2283.34s |  need symbols of this kind, especially if you want to print this in a newspaper. So I have absolutely
2283.34s - 2291.66s |  no idea why he used these symbols and what they mean. And all of them are different. So frequency
2291.66s - 2298.38s |  analysis doesn't help very much. Almost all are different. There's one repetition. So frequency
2298.38s - 2307.74s |  analysis doesn't help. We have no idea what all this is about. And finally, a list of unsolved
2307.74s - 2315.42s |  crypto mysteries would be incomplete without the famous Voynich manuscript. The Voynich manuscript
2315.42s - 2322.86s |  is a handwritten book from the 15th century, probably. It was handmade, so it was handwritten.
2322.86s - 2335.74s |  The drawings were made by hand. It has 230 pages and over 200 illustrations. And the remarkable
2335.74s - 2341.58s |  thing about the Voynich manuscript is that it's written in a script nobody knows and nobody can
2341.58s - 2349.50s |  read. So we have 230 pages filled with this writing. And of course, there have been dozens of
2349.50s - 2359.42s |  analyses of all kinds, but this has led nowhere so far. So this is a really fascinating and really
2359.42s - 2366.94s |  hard crypto mystery. And of course, the question is, is it solvable at all? It could also be a
2366.94s - 2374.70s |  hoax. It could be an encrypted text. It's also possible that an ordinary writing system was used,
2374.70s - 2382.14s |  but that this writing system is lost now. Basically, we have no idea. I think every year,
2382.14s - 2390.30s |  two or three new solutions are published. But so far, I think 70 solutions also can be found on
2390.30s - 2397.98s |  the internet. But in my view, everything is crap so far. And I'm not the only one who thinks this
2397.98s - 2405.50s |  way. Okay, so it's another unsolved crypto mystery and certainly a very famous one.
2407.71s - 2416.27s |  So in conclusion, there are lots of unsolved messages out there. If you would like to help
2416.27s - 2425.47s |  with any of these, a site that we recommend is Mystery Twister. And they have hundreds of
2425.47s - 2433.87s |  different challenges. Some are solved, some are not solved. And you can go in there and you can
2433.87s - 2440.59s |  sort them by what you want. If you want something easy to cut your teeth on, go to a level one
2441.23s - 2448.35s |  cipher. And if you want one of the unsolved messages or one of the very difficult ones,
2448.35s - 2463.10s |  go for a level X. And thank you. Thank you. We have 17 more minutes for questions. Are there any?
2464.14s - 2471.50s |  And again, congratulations to everyone on surviving DEF CON thus far. Just a little
2471.50s - 2483.26s |  bit more to go. Okay. Any questions? Yes. Yes. Back there. Well, we did a book signing
2483.26s - 2488.94s |  on Friday. And of course, we are welcome. You're welcome to come here and we will sign
2488.94s - 2495.02s |  any books. No problem. We also have some book plates with our autographs on them.
2495.02s - 2508.70s |  If someone doesn't have a book. Yes. Repeat the question. The question was, during our research,
2508.70s - 2516.22s |  if we also solved any crypto mysteries? Well, definitely. Well, honestly, we are more the people
2516.22s - 2523.02s |  who talk about it. We are not the great code breakers. But of course, many of the cryptograms
2523.02s - 2529.66s |  that are found are solved. I had a blog introducing unsolved crypto mysteries
2530.54s - 2537.42s |  twice a week or three times a week. And most of the cryptograms I introduced were solved by my
2537.42s - 2542.94s |  blog readers pretty soon. For example, encrypted postcards. I at least published 100 encrypted
2542.94s - 2550.46s |  postcards on my blogs. And I think 99% were solved, except for this only one. So in many cases,
2550.46s - 2554.78s |  it's not even very difficult. In some cases, it's very difficult. So there are very good
2554.78s - 2560.46s |  code breakers around. And in some cases, but that's the exception, no solution is found.
2560.46s - 2568.38s |  Yeah, I mean, I solved probably the biggest one is the Cyrillic Projector. This is also created by
2568.38s - 2574.78s |  Jim Sanborn. And this is a cylinder, which is currently at the University of North Carolina,
2574.78s - 2581.18s |  Charlotte. And it's all the letters are in the Cyrillic language. And I didn't do it alone,
2581.18s - 2586.62s |  it was part of a team. But that's probably the most famous one. Yes.
2603.74s - 2609.42s |  Okay, so if I have understood the question correctly, you ask how to start. If you have
2609.42s - 2617.34s |  an encrypted text, you don't know what it is, how to start? Okay, well, usually you start by,
2617.98s - 2621.74s |  well, first of all, you need background information. So if you get an encrypted text,
2621.74s - 2626.14s |  you always look who might have created it, which languages did this person speak,
2626.70s - 2632.78s |  when was it created? This is important background information. And then you usually
2632.78s - 2639.02s |  apply statistics. So you do a frequency count of the letters, frequency count of the letter pairs
2639.02s - 2644.94s |  of the letter triplets of the word lengths and things like that. Very often, this tells you
2646.38s - 2652.70s |  where to go or what kind of encryption system might have been used. And word guessing is also
2653.66s - 2661.98s |  sometimes a very helpful tool. So yes, and maybe in a couple of years, there will be AI tools who
2661.98s - 2667.90s |  can do this part of the job. I know people who work on this question, and maybe in a couple of
2667.90s - 2673.74s |  years, you feed such a message to an AI tool, and it will at least tell you, well, this looks like
2674.70s - 2679.82s |  a substitution cipher, or this looks like a transposition cipher. And maybe it will even be
2680.62s - 2684.62s |  capable of breaking the cipher. Yeah, some years in the future. And, you know,
2684.62s - 2688.54s |  Captain Picard, computer, please solve the Voynich manuscript, right?
2689.10s - 2695.90s |  Okay, yeah, you can ask. Well, I don't think that this will be successful, but we will see. Yes.
2706.62s - 2715.34s |  Could be. The question was if the encrypted postcard could be something like a pigpen cipher.
2715.34s - 2721.34s |  The pigpen cipher was a very popular cipher for centuries. It's also named the Freemason cipher,
2721.34s - 2729.58s |  because the Freemasons used it, but others used it as well. I wouldn't know how to match
2729.58s - 2734.46s |  these letters of this message with the Freemason cipher with the pigpen cipher. But
2734.46s - 2738.54s |  maybe that's something we could look at again. Who knows?
2739.34s - 2755.06s |  Yeah. Any other questions? Yes. Yes.
2758.58s - 2774.56s |  Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's so many different ways to slice and dice it.
2775.60s - 2781.92s |  If you have an idea, by all means, have at it. Yes. Well, one thing might be important to note,
2781.92s - 2788.72s |  the spaces that can be seen here are added by us. So there are no spaces in the original. It's just
2788.72s - 2794.96s |  to make the thing better readable. Yeah. Put it in groups of five up to the end of the line and
2794.96s - 2801.92s |  then start the next line with groups of five. Sure. No. Any other? All the help we can get.
2801.92s - 2834.35s |  Yes. I can't hear. Sorry. You mean that this message here that it was created with a system
2834.35s - 2841.63s |  that includes a key and without the key, it's not possible? Well, this kind of system, this
2841.63s - 2848.03s |  was available at the time at the end of the 19th century. So it's certainly possible. The question
2848.03s - 2855.71s |  is if Edward Elgar used such a system to write a message to a friend who apparently had no clue
2855.71s - 2862.91s |  about cryptography. But it certainly would have been possible to use a system that is not
2862.91s - 2884.11s |  breakable today. Yes. You mean a language? You mean a cipher and a writing system?
2884.11s - 2893.68s |  How do we tell if we're dealing with a language or a cipher? Great question.
2894.56s - 2900.32s |  Well, from a cryptographic point of view, a writing system and a simple substitution cipher
2900.32s - 2909.20s |  are the same. So you can use the same methods to break them. So if simply other letters are used,
2909.20s - 2915.12s |  it can be regarded as an encryption, although it was not really meant to be an encryption. It was
2915.12s - 2922.08s |  simply used, simply another system was used. If the encryption is more complicated,
2922.08s - 2927.68s |  you usually see this when you look at the statistics. For example, in English,
2927.68s - 2934.00s |  the E is the most frequent letter with a frequency of about 12 or 14 percent.
2935.52s - 2941.60s |  And if the distribution looks more even, you know that it's not a simple substitution cipher and not
2941.60s - 2946.64s |  an unknown writing system. It must be something else, either a good or a better encryption system
2946.88s - 2954.00s |  or maybe random data or whatever. Sometimes it's difficult to tell.
2960.48s - 2962.00s |  Any other questions?
2963.84s - 2970.48s |  All right. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good questions.
