**Introduction**
- Presentation topic: Inside Dash Cam
- Presenters: Hyo Jin Lee and Hanryeol Park
- Affiliation: Researchers at Xi'an, XIoT security convergence company

**Dash Cam Overview**
- Market size: Valued at $4.03 billion in 2023
- Growth projection: 9.6% CAGR from 2024 to 2030
- Modern advancements: Network connectivity, controlled via dedicated apps

**Security Concerns**
- **Potential Risks**: Network connectivity introduces security threats
- **Vulnerability Discovery**: Zero-day vulnerabilities such as OS Command Injection, Logical Bugs, insufficient authentication
- **Analysis Focus**: Boot process, configuration changes, custom protocols

**Dash Cam Analysis Process**
- **Firmware Acquisition**: 
  - Methods: Official websites, debugging ports (e.g., UART, JTAG), firmware upgrade functionality, APK files
  - Tools: Binoc, 7zip
- **Port Scanning**: 
  - Tools: nmap
  - Common open ports: FTP, Telnet, DNS, HTTP, RPC, RTSP
- **Boot Logic Analysis**: 
  - Files: etc-init-daemon, etc-rc-local, system-daemon
  - Tools: ps command, netstat command
- **Binary Debugging**: 
  - Tools: gdb, bgbox
  - Methods: Real-time analysis, watchdog bypass strategies

**Protocol Analysis**
- **Communication Analysis**: 
  - Methods: Capturing communication packets, analyzing APK and binary code
  - Custom Protocols: HEX and JSON formats
  - Tools: Frida for encrypted communication

**Zero-Day Scenarios**
- **SD Card Vulnerabilities**: Shell script execution
- **RTSP Protocol Vulnerabilities**: Stack buffer overflow
- **Wi-Fi and GPS Settings**: OS command injection
- **Custom Protocols**: Improper authentication

**Recommendations and Future Work**
- **Script Code Removal**: From SD card paths used for testing
- **Enhance Security**: Add authentication, verification processes
- **Input Validation**: Special characters and length values
