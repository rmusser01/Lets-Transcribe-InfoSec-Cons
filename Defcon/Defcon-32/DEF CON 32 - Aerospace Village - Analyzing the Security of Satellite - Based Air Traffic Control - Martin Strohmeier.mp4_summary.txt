**Introduction to Satellite-Based Air Traffic Control Security**
- Analyzing the security of satellite-based air traffic control
- **Speaker**: Martin Strohmeier from the Swiss Department of Defense

**Overview of Air Traffic Control Technology**
- DEF CON conferences have explored air traffic control attacks
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Potentially catastrophic consequences if attacked
- Overview of technologies, communications, protocols in aviation

**Security Concerns in Aviation**
- **Aviation Standards**: No inherent security or authentication
- Practical attacks on aviation communication technologies since early 2010s
- **Receiver and Transmitter Implementation**: Using software-defined radios for security analysis

**Satellite-Based Air Traffic Control Technologies**
- Technologies involve aircraft-satellite communications
- **Satellite ADS-B**: Known vulnerabilities, similar to terrestrial ADS-B
- **ADS-C (ADS Contract)**: Developed in the 90s, gained popularity for tracking over oceans

**Satellite ADS-B Vulnerabilities**
- Space-based ADS-B picks up terrestrial signals, vulnerable to attacks
- Companies claim space-based systems are secure due to distance
- **Reality**: Space is not inherently secure; potential for ghost aircraft transmission

**ADS-C (Automatic Dependent Surveillance Contract) Details**
- Provides aircraft information to ground stations
- **Data Includes**: Position, altitude, speed, navigational intent
- Enhances monitoring in remote areas without terrestrial surveillance

**Importance of ADS-C Technology**
- Crucial for aircraft monitoring in remote areas
- Reduces reliance on traditional voice communication
- Enables efficient airspace utilization

**Security Analysis of ADS-C**
- **Passive Attacker**: Eavesdrops on satellite messages
- **Active Attacker**: Can disrupt communication and inject false data
- **Uplink and Downlink Attacks**: Denial of service, spoofing positions

**Real-World Evaluation and Testing**
- Receiver setup for downlink and uplink messages
- Building a transmitter from existing SDR implementations
- **Testing**: Successful injection of messages into ADS-C system

**Conclusion**
- Satellite-based air traffic control increases airspace efficiency
- **Security Concerns**: Lack of authentication, vulnerable to eavesdropping and active attacks
- **Cost and Complexity**: Low barrier to entry for attackers with minimal resources

**Future Discussions**
- Additional talks on related satellite security topics at DEF CON and USENIX security conferences
