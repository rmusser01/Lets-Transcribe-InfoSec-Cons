**Introduction to Web Cache Exploitation**
- Web cache attacks are used to steal sensitive data, deface websites, and deliver exploits.
- **HTTP Request Smuggling**: Caused by parser inconsistencies, leading to vulnerabilities.
- **Web caches' URL-parsers**: Attacking these can bypass web cache deception and poisoning attack limitations.

**New Techniques in Web Cache Exploitation**
- **Static Path Deception**: Compromises confidentiality with case studies like Nginx behind Cloudflare.
- **Cache Key Confusion**: Exploits URL parsing inconsistencies in platforms like Microsoft Azure Cloud for arbitrary cache poisoning and denial of service.
- Live demo demonstrates combining Cache Key Confusion with open redirects for site takeover.

**Web Cache Functionality**
- **Key Calculation**: Identifies requested resources, ignoring headers like cookies or user agent.
- **Response Generation**: Cache proxies handle responses without contacting original servers, using calculated keys to identify static resources.

**Web Cache Deception**
- **Basic Attack**: Uses path parameters and regex to access sensitive information, requiring user interaction.
- **Advanced Attack**: Uses RFC-defined delimiters to manipulate URL paths across different server frameworks.

**Common Delimiters and Implementations**
- **Spring Framework**: Uses semicolon for matrix variables.
- **Rails Framework**: Uses dot for view identification.
- **Open Light Speed and Nginx**: Use encoded null byte and newline as delimiters, respectively.

**Defending Against Web Cache Deception**
- **Cloudflare's Web Cache Deception Armor**: Matches request extensions with response content types to prevent attacks.
- **Static Directories Rule**: Common in applications, used to store static files which can be targeted for attacks.

**Cache Poisoning**
- **Objective**: Store malicious responses with keys accessed by users to hijack sessions.
- **Key Normalization**: Essential for exploiting cache poisoning, with many CDNs having unique rules that can be exploited.

**Defense Mechanisms**
- **Cache Control Headers**: Use private and no-store for sensitive responses.
- Check CDN rules to ensure they don't override cache control headers.
- **Key Normalization**: Disable if possible to prevent poison attacks.

**Conclusion and Recommendations**
- **Exploitation Potential**: Delimiters and discrepancies can be found in many systems, offering bounty opportunities.
- **Tools and Resources**: Use provided tools to detect discrepancies and adjust server or frontend configurations.
- **Innovation and Research**: Encourage finding and reporting new vulnerabilities and exploit combinations for better security practices.
