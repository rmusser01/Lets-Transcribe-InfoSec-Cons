  "title": "DEF CON 32 - Hacking Millions of Modems and Investigating Who Hacked My Modem - Sam Curry",
  "description": "On December 25th, 2021, I discovered that my modem had been hacked after a strange IP address replayed my traffic. I began researching who they were, how it happened, and eventually discovered a vulnerability which allowed me to passively monitor, change configurations, and execute commands on millions of devices. This talk details 3 years of intermittent web research on ISP security and how broadband equipment is becoming scarily centralized.",

1.81s - 3.81s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Sing hello. Hello. Hello
3.81s - 7.89s |  Yeah, so this talk just to kind of lightly introduce it is a kind of a two series talk
8.41s - 10.41s |  so the first part of this talk is a
10.81s - 15.29s |  Few years ago my modem gets hacked and the second part of this talk is like actually going and hacking the ISP
15.41s - 17.41s |  So there's like a bit of a break in the mid part of it
18.53s - 21.13s |  Yeah, as people kind of filter in just a little bit. We'll go ahead and kick it off
21.69s - 25.16s |  We still have three minutes or a little early
25.76s - 32.14s |  What's the deal with airline food?
32.38s - 44.14s |  Yeah, so Southwest is doing a science heating now, which is kind of I don't know. How do you guys feel about that?
46.18s - 52.87s |  Cool so I think most people kind of came in so we'll go and just kick it off
54.31s - 56.31s |  So it's like a really quick who am I?
56.39s - 59.59s |  My background is just like really heavy and like web security. It's like my one thing
59.59s - 61.59s |  I'm like really really serious like love about so
61.99s - 67.21s |  All my passion like last like six years is just like non-stop like bug bounty consulting and like kind of web sec research
67.47s - 70.95s |  One thing I'm really proud of is like the port swigger top ten web hacking techniques
70.95s - 73.11s |  We've kind of hit that like every year for some sort of research
73.75s - 74.39s |  But yeah
74.39s - 79.51s |  Some kind of things here at the bottom just to a lot of people who have over the last few years like really helped with
79.79s - 83.87s |  Running like blog posts doing like really good research and just kind of helping with any questions
84.47s - 90.19s |  Specifically, yeah, Justin Reinhardt Alden and Philip Brett Ian Nathaniel Mike shubs Joel and William. Thank you
90.95s - 100.79s |  Yeah, so our story begins in 2022 and in 2022
100.79s - 103.91s |  I was on a pen test and I was kind of working for my home network
104.23s - 105.71s |  And when I was working on this pen test
105.71s - 111.35s |  I had to spin up a box like on AWS to log requests for an HTTP server for an xxe vulnerability
111.91s - 112.99s |  So when I was doing it
112.99s - 118.59s |  I sent like a test request my home network to see if that web server was live and when I send hello
118.71s - 120.07s |  Everything worked expectedly
120.07s - 122.99s |  There's you know get slash hello in the log file and everything was good to go
123.35s - 125.83s |  But just a few minutes later after I tab back into the screen
125.83s - 129.63s |  I saw this really really weird IP address that had replayed the exact same
129.67s - 135.07s |  HTTP request that I'd sent and this was kind of freaky to me because I just spun up this AWS account and it
135.43s - 137.43s |  Probably meant my computer had been hacked
137.43s - 141.71s |  But like in order to actually research it I kind of pulled up other devices on my network
141.71s - 147.91s |  so I loaded it from my phone my laptop even the smart TV and my like guest bedroom and then the
148.87s - 152.03s |  Everything was like resending the exact same HTTP request
152.39s - 158.87s |  So my network had been compromised somewhere along the kind of flow and I assumed it was my modem because you know
158.87s - 162.23s |  That's like the easiest thing to pop but I really didn't know at the time. So I was just really curious
163.47s - 166.75s |  So part one of this is just really quick who hacked my modem, right?
166.75s - 170.47s |  And the IP resolves to like this weird digital ocean IP
170.47s - 174.19s |  And the reason I say it's weird is because if you look at the history of the IP
174.39s - 177.13s |  There's all these like really weird ops that it does, right?
177.39s - 181.31s |  So there's like these phishing domains and like this really weird domain format
181.31s - 186.55s |  They've done so at one point in time the IP address ping back to all these different domains is like a host provider
186.95s - 192.03s |  So for me, it's weird because it's like, you know, if you hack me you're gonna run like C2 from that IP
192.35s - 195.27s |  But these domains are like websites with like, you know
195.67s - 200.83s |  Beef and like hook.js right and like so they're doing like targeted phishing campaigns against these websites
200.83s - 205.83s |  And it was really weird and one of the websites was I'll go forward. I think a little bit
205.83s - 212.07s |  Oh, maybe I delete the slide but ISG LATAM, right and ISG LATAM is like this South American cybersecurity company
212.31s - 217.91s |  So it's really weird that like this IP address was like also hacking this South American cybersecurity company
217.91s - 220.47s |  So I was like super intrigued right because like, you know
220.47s - 223.83s |  If one person pops here to like hit somebody offline on like a botnet or something
223.83s - 229.95s |  It's like oh, that's cool. But like who is like hacking South American cybersecurity companies, but also like random modems
229.95s - 231.95s |  I was really curious and
232.23s - 236.43s |  something that a few friends Philip and Alden and Justin helped me with later on is like
236.59s - 240.79s |  We looked into it and we realized that like at one point in time this really weird
241.55s - 245.47s |  DGA or like domain generation algorithm domains were pointed at the IP address
245.59s - 251.15s |  So they have like this really weird format and there was like thousands of these domains that somebody had bought and like rotated for this
251.15s - 254.59s |  Malware, so whoever hacked the modem was like doing this really sophisticated thing
254.59s - 260.63s |  But also like doing like normal human ops where they're like running phishing sites and this is all just kind of from like historical
261.79s - 265.19s |  History of that IP address. So I was like, okay, very very strange
265.63s - 267.63s |  So I
267.67s - 269.79s |  Tried some tricks with this, right? I
270.39s - 275.47s |  Kind of thought like okay if this person is like planted malware on my device and like there's somewhere in between
275.91s - 280.35s |  Maybe we could like command inject the curl requests. They're sending because it's really weird, right?
280.35s - 286.19s |  Like if you're passively monitoring someone's traffic, it's like that's one thing but like replaying the HTTP request is really bizarre, right?
286.43s - 291.35s |  Like the only thing I think is like if they've like built a SAS dashboard for like their hack devices
291.35s - 294.83s |  And they're like taking screenshots or something. I don't know. It was really weird
294.83s - 301.27s |  But no luck here like we couldn't figure out any redirect or like finding some way to control that malicious IP address
302.75s - 307.51s |  Yeah, so Cox Communications is the name of ISP and we uh took the device
307.51s - 311.15s |  I took it back to the store and I was like, hey, you know, like I think my device is hacked
311.15s - 316.47s |  I want to keep it but I want to get like a second modem and they're like, yeah, you actually rent that device
316.47s - 317.47s |  You have to give it to us
317.47s - 322.87s |  So the dude just took it and I was really sad because like at that point in time like there's nothing you really do
322.87s - 329.07s |  You know, like the actual compromise device is gone. So really sadly, you know two years later
329.87s - 334.27s |  no device, but I was helping a buddy move and this little guy is me on the phone and
334.91s - 337.91s |  My buddy he was setting up his modem at like a new house, right?
337.91s - 342.51s |  And I called the tech support like yo, you know, like we need to get this new device hooked on fiber
342.55s - 346.87s |  How does that work? Like can you do it for me? And the dude on the phone is just like yeah
346.87s - 350.59s |  You know like we can hook you up to fiber and like do everything remotely and I was like, whoa
350.59s - 355.19s |  that's like really interesting you can manage like more than just like Wi-Fi password or whatever and
355.59s - 360.27s |  I looked into a little bit of like how the ISP tech support actually does it and there's this protocol that like a lot of
360.27s - 365.39s |  People are probably familiar with called TR 6 9 or TR 0 6 9 and this protocol is like super research
365.39s - 369.51s |  There's actually a few really cool DEF CON talks about it where people have actually popped the protocol itself
369.79s - 371.79s |  but thing that's really interesting to me is that like
372.47s - 378.95s |  This protocol isn't accessible from the internet, right? And I wasn't externally exposing this protocol. So like I probably wasn't hacked like this
379.39s - 386.83s |  However, there exists this really cool like API or some sort of functionality between the call center and the ACS so
387.83s - 392.27s |  If you're like a tech support person, there's probably some like internal API they've built like manage a device
392.27s - 396.63s |  And I was really curious like what what exists there and like can we look into it?
397.55s - 402.35s |  so this kind of kicks off part two right the hacking millions of modems and so again, I
402.99s - 404.83s |  Kind of had a thought here where it's like, okay
404.99s - 409.27s |  If I wanted to like hack my modem and I wanted to do it through this like weird like
410.03s - 413.11s |  process of going through the ISP because you know in that way like
413.31s - 417.71s |  You've got like so much more exposed and there's such a rich attack surface where like if you pop the support agent
417.71s - 419.03s |  I was like well
419.03s - 423.75s |  The business portal is like the second best thing to the actual tech support portal that they're using
423.99s - 426.75s |  If you have like a residential customer account, it's like okay
426.75s - 431.11s |  You can like reset your device and it's pretty boring right like but the business side of things
431.11s - 434.55s |  It's like manage VLAN manage security group manage everything, right?
434.99s - 437.79s |  So I kind of looked into it and I didn't have an account
437.79s - 442.19s |  so I was just like pilfering the JavaScript like a beggar, you know, I was grabbing all these endpoints and
443.59s - 445.43s |  There's this whole like
445.43s - 452.83s |  API CBMA format so like every single API call for the Cox business site was prefixed was this like a API CBMA and I
452.83s - 454.83s |  thought this was really cool because like I
455.11s - 456.79s |  Did a lot of research and like, you know
456.79s - 462.43s |  Reverse proxies and stuff and like API CBMA was behaving like so much differently than like any other requests on the site
462.43s - 466.55s |  So I thought like, you know, there's a chance that that's some like internal API that we can kind of dig into
467.27s - 471.39s |  So I started playing with it a bit and you can kind of see the format of this request here if it's too small
471.39s - 473.75s |  it's basically just like a registration request and
474.51s - 479.75s |  With this request there's a few headers API key client ID and then just like the path itself, right?
479.75s - 485.35s |  And it works really good. But one thing I was curious like where these endpoints actually at right so
486.27s - 489.67s |  The really easy thing to do is just like look for like actuators or swagger files
489.67s - 494.47s |  And I was really stoked because like I couldn't find actuators, but I did find the swagger UI
494.87s - 498.47s |  but something kind of annoying for us very sad face right is like
499.39s - 504.81s |  the JavaScript and like every static resource on that page wasn't loading and the reason this was
505.11s - 507.39s |  Happening is because the static resources
508.03s - 511.63s |  Even though the API CBMA route was like proxying to that internal API
512.31s - 518.79s |  Anything like dot JS dot CSS dot HTML was being normally sent to the front-end web server as it was like a static resource
518.99s - 520.99s |  so in order to actually like load the
520.99s - 525.49s |  Resources from that back-end server if we just chucked in a percent 2f or like a slash at the end of it
525.55s - 530.95s |  It would actually still carry that request to that reverse proxy and this is really fun for us because now it's just like
531.19s - 533.19s |  Happy face, right? We can load the swagger
534.07s - 540.35s |  These reverse proxies are like super super interesting and like a really good point of research I think but to kind of continue on a little
541.31s - 544.63s |  This swagger file had like 700 different routes, right?
545.03s - 547.79s |  So to kind of go through each of these is like really interesting
547.79s - 552.55s |  But there's a few that were like really really cool to me right like data internet gateway and like account equipment, right?
553.23s - 555.23s |  because even though like the
555.71s - 558.11s |  The site itself was just for like business management
558.11s - 562.07s |  It still seemed to have like a lot more functionality than like what would needed to be exposed for that
562.07s - 564.07s |  So I assume maybe there's like some extra stuff here
564.95s - 570.55s |  So the easiest thing for us or for me to do here is just like chuck it in an intruder and like try to send a
570.55s - 572.99s |  get request or like post requests or whatever these endpoints and
573.51s - 574.71s |  I
574.71s - 578.71s |  Realized that very like kind of oddly there's this pattern, right?
578.71s - 585.99s |  And this pattern is strange because like instead of like categories of API endpoints like being unauthenticated or authenticated
585.99s - 588.15s |  It was just like a percentage of them, you know
588.15s - 592.71s |  and like there's nothing discernible about like which API endpoints were or weren't authenticated and
593.19s - 599.71s |  It was around like 50% gave you an authorization error 35% bad requests and like 15% were success and it's like, okay
599.71s - 604.03s |  You know like kind of strange as there's no pattern for like what is or isn't authenticated
604.31s - 608.87s |  So I kind of I continue around a little bit and what I found was this endpoint that had originally returned
608.91s - 613.75s |  200 if I just kept sending it over and over again, it would give me like different authorization errors
613.75s - 615.23s |  So my immediate thought is like, okay
615.23s - 620.11s |  There's like a weird load balancer here and like the authorization just seems like proper broken, right?
621.07s - 622.19s |  so profile search
622.19s - 627.15s |  it looked like it took a parameter via the URI so I went ahead and just like chucked in like a funny test string
627.15s - 629.15s |  and I just wrote like FBI and
630.83s - 632.83s |  The results
633.15s - 636.59s |  It's uh, like it gave me just like 30 FBI field offices
637.99s - 639.99s |  and it was cool too because uh
640.03s - 644.95s |  Yeah, like it had the address like he's Google and be like, oh like that's like a proper, you know customer
645.23s - 649.27s |  And at this point it's like, alright, we're gonna start drafting the report, but we you know, you Google a bit
649.27s - 651.27s |  you find the building right and
651.39s - 653.39s |  For us, it's cool. It's like, okay, like
653.99s - 658.03s |  Clearly this API is a little broken right and you can access like some customer records
658.03s - 662.67s |  But like the thing that's really interesting for us and thing I was curious like how do we access like device stuff, right?
662.83s - 664.83s |  so I went back to that API and
665.15s - 670.27s |  I found this really really simple HTTP requests in the API docs and it took a parameter called MAC address
670.51s - 673.27s |  So I went to the back of my modem and I took my MAC address from it
673.27s - 677.35s |  I just threw in this API and it returned my eye my current IPv4 address
677.35s - 683.11s |  And this is really really really cool for us because as a residential customer accessing through like the business API
683.23s - 685.27s |  I'm able to hit my own device, right?
685.27s - 692.59s |  So it confirms that there's like this ecosystem and I'm like being ported internally and can like actually hit my device. So
693.35s - 697.31s |  Really cool for us, you know, and it made me want to keep digging a little bit, right?
698.79s - 700.99s |  So the second thing I did is like, all right
700.99s - 706.71s |  How do I get someone else's MAC address and there's this endpoint to retrieve like a user account via like email or you just like
706.71s - 711.71s |  Search via like name or whatever and it's gonna return like the user ID of the account and then really simply you can just pull
711.71s - 717.47s |  Out the equipment on the account. So every single connected device like iPhone TV, whatever is connected to the Internet
717.47s - 723.27s |  You could just pull here passively. There's no like triggers or like notifications the account holder when you access this data
723.55s - 728.19s |  So it's really cool because it's just like oh, you know, my neighbor has like a new TV or something. Very nice
728.99s - 734.10s |  But cool like this point it's like it's a pretty bad bug
734.10s - 739.26s |  But like, you know, it's just like PII and like there's some interesting things. But yeah, it's like how do we escalate this, right?
739.70s - 742.54s |  There was a lot of like cool endpoints like voicemails emails
743.10s - 747.46s |  Things like that like Cox is a pretty big like broadband provider and they do a bunch of different things
747.46s - 750.90s |  So the question we now has like how do we actually update devices?
751.50s - 756.02s |  So there's this parameter I kept saying called encrypted value, right?
756.02s - 760.94s |  And encrypted value is kind of annoying because it's like as an unauthenticated user who can't actually use the app
760.94s - 763.10s |  It's like how do we figure out what this value is, right?
763.10s - 768.10s |  and when we would query it it would give this sort of sale error and the sale error was kind of weird because it's
768.10s - 773.66s |  Like I have no idea what sale is or kind of how it works. So I did some amazing OSINT and
774.86s - 779.34s |  found out someone on LinkedIn was really happy to share what sale was with us and
780.34s - 786.02s |  Sale turns out to be what I think is just like the internal Cox communications like device communication stuff, right?
786.14s - 791.30s |  So, you know if you built like a new website you use and leverage this like seal protocol internally
791.30s - 794.06s |  And then that's how you kind of like talk to devices, right?
794.26s - 800.78s |  Because if we go back to like TR 69 there's basically like a point of authentication like at the two device communication
800.78s - 806.02s |  So like if you wanted to make that simpler you just build this like infrastructure that like leverages that and has the secrets
806.02s - 811.50s |  So sale itself was like this authenticated internal thing from the sounds of it as like an external person
812.26s - 818.50s |  So we kind of dug through the JavaScript and the JavaScript is really cool because it references encrypted value a bunch and I
818.94s - 824.78s |  Kind of trace it a while and eventually found out that there was this function to like encrypt or decrypt a string
824.78s - 829.22s |  But it was like this really weird kind of like runtime thing and we could have extracted it and ran it
829.22s - 832.50s |  But I thought the easiest thing to do here is just to toss it
833.46s - 837.02s |  Find the point in the app where like it uses this function and do it like a breakpoint
837.54s - 843.06s |  So there's this endpoint to like register and there's a four-digit pen and the four-digit pen is like encrypted client-side
843.30s - 847.02s |  So if you just like set a breakpoint here and then throw it in the console
847.06s - 849.70s |  You can actually just like go ahead and encrypt or decrypt the values
850.46s - 852.74s |  So here's like an example string, right?
853.54s - 857.02s |  Now this string is cool because like it shows kind of the whole format of how it works
857.02s - 862.66s |  And we just encrypted the value like 8042 and I pass it in to the endpoint for device management
862.78s - 868.62s |  And it was really really cool because like the sale error it gave was like one for error, you know
868.62s - 870.90s |  We've decrypted it successfully, but we really don't know what to do with it
870.90s - 874.70s |  Like it's now like a different error, which means that like on the back-end sale stuff
874.70s - 879.50s |  They're using that same encryption, which is huge because it's like now we can I hit those device endpoints, right?
880.50s - 885.74s |  So I hit up a friend and they run like a small MSP in Omaha, Nebraska, and they're like, hey, you know
885.74s - 889.66s |  I'm a Cox business customer. Do you wanna like sign my account? So I did and
890.18s - 894.74s |  I'm happy to do that and you know and pilfer a little bit and we found that there's like the
895.38s - 897.38s |  actual like example parameter encrypted value
897.70s - 902.90s |  And when you decrypt that parameter you get like this kind of string below and actually deep dive that string
903.30s - 906.02s |  You have like the following values in a decrypted value
906.78s - 910.78s |  So you have like the account number device ID device name and all this random stuff
910.78s - 914.46s |  But the thing that was really interesting to us is like there's this MAC address parameter, right?
914.46s - 916.78s |  and I was kind of scared at this point because it's like
917.50s - 921.90s |  Well, if I'm an attacker and I don't like pop somebody I just want to do it like via MAC address
921.90s - 926.26s |  so like if there's any way to like just do it with only the MAC address to be the easiest so I just went
926.26s - 928.26s |  Ahead and like signed a bunch of data
928.54s - 935.70s |  With a MAC address and everything else being like junk data. And after I did that it worked perfect, right?
936.74s - 938.74s |  so we we sent this request and
939.54s - 945.22s |  This is my own Wi-Fi with a encrypted MAC address and I wouldn't send it and it returned like this success error
945.38s - 950.42s |  And I was like, okay, what does that mean? So I like recent requests again, but I realized like my whole network was offline
951.30s - 952.46s |  so
952.46s - 959.62s |  This update request like actually kind of like just took mine. It updated my device configuration took the device offline and rebooted it
961.30s - 961.98s |  And yeah
961.98s - 966.78s |  so like I was able to just update my thing here which is kind of like the boom where it's like you can actually
966.78s - 971.82s |  Push these configuration settings and like that underlying TR-69 protocol. You can do like whatever you want, right?
971.82s - 977.34s |  You have the same permissions as like a support agent. So like updating Wi-Fi password viewing connected devices
977.70s - 981.58s |  You know basically like using device as a proxy essentially like opening ports, you know
981.58s - 984.26s |  Anything you could normally do as a support agent you do via this, right?
984.74s - 989.22s |  So it's like GG for that you could I think the actual route if you want to get RCE via this is there's like a
989.22s - 996.02s |  Push pushing a configuration or like a new package for the device and it's it's it's interesting because it's like, you know
996.82s - 1000.98s |  This kill chain right where it's like one find someone's account ID to
1001.66s - 1006.10s |  You know get their MAC address and like three you can just like do a bunch of random hardware stuff. That's really fun
1006.90s - 1009.78s |  but like now what you know, like it's it's kind of scary because
1010.46s - 1012.46s |  what actually kicked off a lot of this research is uh
1013.70s - 1017.62s |  There's this really interesting like point of centralization for like all ISPs, right?
1017.78s - 1020.06s |  So even if you use like Cox or a smaller ISP
1020.06s - 1026.94s |  There's a few like really big ISPs like Comcast and Comcast actually like develops a lot of software for all these different ISPs, right?
1027.10s - 1031.10s |  So if you open your like, you know Cox app you think it's going through the servers, right?
1031.10s - 1036.30s |  And the thing is like it actually talks to like Comcast to authenticate, right? So
1037.02s - 1039.10s |  This one like single HTTP server
1039.10s - 1045.10s |  It's like DH dot something dot Comcast dotnet has like hundreds of millions of devices behind like a single web server, right?
1045.38s - 1049.66s |  So if somebody pop this it's just bizarre because yeah 10 petabytes of data a day or something like that
1050.18s - 1056.62s |  They're collecting just insane like whatever, you know and like with like FISA authorization or FISA, however you say it
1056.94s - 1060.22s |  I'm sorry, I'm not Edward Snowden or whatever but the FISA
1061.90s - 1062.98s |  It's
1062.98s - 1068.34s |  Kind of scary because like they're it's just like an easy gateway to just like passively monitor like all this random metadata
1068.58s - 1074.22s |  Because I think like 10 years ago, you know, maybe they're not logging like the actual names of devices connected to your network
1074.22s - 1078.86s |  but like now it's just like a crazy amount of metadata that's being stored on like one system, right and
1080.58s - 1083.18s |  Here's like this is totally unreadable by the way, so
1083.86s - 1085.10s |  I'm sorry about that
1085.10s - 1090.50s |  This is just an HTTP request to Comcast like when you actually authenticate to your app through the Cox app
1090.50s - 1095.82s |  So like, you know Cox is just levering this for authentication. So it just demonstrates like hey you pop like this one API
1095.82s - 1098.78s |  it's GG for hundreds of millions of devices and
1099.78s - 1100.94s |  yeah
1100.94s - 1104.86s |  kind of a shorter talk and I think the whole idea of this is just kind of go through like
1105.22s - 1110.50s |  this point is like very very interesting where it's like these single points of failure were like massive impact and
1111.06s - 1116.70s |  Just a really quick summary like Cox was like super super great to work with but they confirmed like hey, you know this
1117.54s - 1121.62s |  Vulnerability you found isn't actually the one you got hacked by because we introduced it later in time, right?
1121.82s - 1123.74s |  But the possibility there of like, you know
1123.74s - 1128.58s |  Someone in hacking at like an ISP level these like API is built on TR 6 times like really fascinating
1128.58s - 1133.78s |  And they did confirm to like that digital ocean IP is like not there's all it's like somebody did own the modem
1133.78s - 1135.78s |  but it's like not via that and
1136.18s - 1139.10s |  Just like a really quick, you know, thanks for watching
1139.94s - 1141.94s |  There's a ton
1143.34s - 1145.34s |  Somebody said there'd be some bleed from the rooms. Yeah
1146.22s - 1149.14s |  but uh
1149.14s - 1152.34s |  I'm sorry. I'm just so curious. What's going on? But uh
1153.38s - 1161.22s |  Yeah, there's some really great like references for this and like I really I'm really hopeful for like more research here in the future
1161.22s - 1167.78s |  But there's a lot of the things that like people can find vulnerabilities in are like behind like a VDP with like a non-disclosure terms
1167.94s - 1172.34s |  So I think people have probably found like similar issues before and I'm really really curious to see what kind of comes out of
1172.34s - 1174.94s |  Things like this. Yeah, here's a few links to cock stuff
1174.94s - 1180.46s |  And I really really appreciate you guys coming this really short talk and I hope it kind of shows some light on like this
1180.46s - 1181.82s |  specific vector
1181.82s - 1196.92s |  and I think we probably have a bunch of time for like QA if anybody is anything in particular, but
1197.96s - 1203.90s |  Are we gonna do mics or just like? Oh, yeah happy. Yeah, feel free
1206.67s - 1210.95s |  Working with Cox was great big fan. They're honestly like a really good team like
1211.59s - 1214.47s |  They did the thing where like every message they responded with it was like legally
1214.83s - 1220.15s |  Verified it felt like like they copied and pasted in a bunch of different formats, but really good team
1221.91s - 1225.29s |  They did
1225.69s - 1226.85s |  Yeah
1226.85s - 1232.18s |  yeah, so
1232.18s - 1239.34s |  Honestly like Python scripts and like bash scripts and stuff like chat DVDs so good for a random stuff like that. But yeah
1240.62s - 1242.54s |  So I'm sorry
1242.54s - 1250.14s |  Yeah, so I haven't actually looked at like any of the other ONTs on the market
1250.14s - 1253.14s |  But like they're really fascinating like setting up that little fiber thing
1253.14s - 1257.82s |  A lot of people I know who work at ISPs like you should definitely dig into that. It's like really messed up, but
1258.58s - 1260.58s |  Yeah, let me see if there's any
1262.10s - 1268.55s |  Yeah, it's like really interesting because like this is like something that like grows and adds like
1269.59s - 1270.79s |  Sorry, yeah
1270.79s - 1277.11s |  So specters asks like if there's anything like any other vulnerabilities that exist in that ecosystem and it's like 100% right like this is like
1277.11s - 1283.85s |  An ecosystem that like grows and changes and like updates and stuff. So people you're gonna find more stuff. Yeah. Sorry. Could I a hermit?
1284.33s - 1293.44s |  Yeah working with ISPs like telcos I feel like for vulnerability disclosure is like they're very
1295.00s - 1300.04s |  Like more government legal feeling than like many other organizations because if you like Silicon Valley like Robin Hood
1300.04s - 1306.20s |  It's like pretty chill, you know, but like with them. It's like such a structured organization. It's like going to the 2000s America
1306.76s - 1316.83s |  Yeah, so it's it was actually like a Comcast device. I think is like the Cox panoramic Wi-Fi, but
1318.15s - 1320.15s |  Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's pretty
1328.15s - 1331.79s |  Yeah, so right adding the customer data to the blockchain I think is a
1332.35s - 1335.17s |  Could help secure it, you know, like less attack vectors
1335.99s - 1341.71s |  Yeah, so if you have a question, there's a microphone here. So everybody in the audience can hear you
1341.71s - 1343.71s |  Oh, yeah, Derek if you want
1344.15s - 1350.81s |  So did you ever figure out how they were mirroring your traffic? Yeah, I don't know
1350.81s - 1354.01s |  it's it's really interesting because like the the actual review process like I
1354.93s - 1357.77s |  Never found the malware like I turned in that copy of device, but it's like
1358.77s - 1360.77s |  Probably
1361.13s - 1365.13s |  I'm not I don't even know just some like a middle part. They throw in there. Wait, sorry
1366.29s - 1372.53s |  I'm sorry, but the schedule says you have 45 minutes, but you only presented 20. Did you cut anything?
1373.69s - 1375.69s |  Yeah, so there was a lot of like
1376.13s - 1382.93s |  There's some revisions. I worked really close with a team a bit with Cox and stuff. So some of the content was
1383.93s - 1388.89s |  They didn't specifically ask that anything be removed but like it was an agreement for like certain content
1389.45s - 1391.21s |  yeah, so
1391.21s - 1395.89s |  Definitely a shorter talk, but hopefully it's more chill than you know, nobody fall asleep or something
1397.45s - 1398.69s |  Cheers
1398.69s - 1399.73s |  when
1399.73s - 1405.97s |  When you asked if you could keep your modem, did they look at you weird or they like why would you want to keep this?
1405.97s - 1408.73s |  That's insanity. Yeah, so like the I
1409.25s - 1415.97s |  Think I used the word reverse engineer and they thought it was like a trade secret thing. Oh, yeah, so they didn't really like that. Yeah
1417.57s - 1428.25s |  Yeah, she just told it yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. Um, so I work with spectrum actually
1430.53s - 1436.01s |  One of the things I've noticed with us and I think it's for similar reasons to this is that we've
1436.33s - 1440.21s |  Stopped providing modems and routers that you can log into. Yep. That's
1441.21s - 1447.77s |  Completely out of the question you have to go through our website and we only give you a couple options like here's your password and
1447.77s - 1455.49s |  Whatever. Have you noticed that with many providers like seen that before? Yeah hundred percent. So the the like
1456.49s - 1460.01s |  Internetization of like modems just feels like this weird byproduct of like everything moving
1460.01s - 1463.45s |  It's like oh we're gonna do a new features like we're gonna add this security gateway and all this stuff
1463.57s - 1466.65s |  So yeah, it does it definitely feels like devices are moving towards like less
1467.53s - 1472.97s |  Management like locally on the network and like more management on the cloud which is like maybe more accessible to people but like it
1472.97s - 1474.97s |  Yeah, it does create that centralization problem
1475.89s - 1478.25s |  Was Ian also involved in this research?
1479.21s - 1482.89s |  Ian Carroll did a lot of review for the slides. Very happy
1483.49s - 1484.89s |  Yeah
1484.89s - 1486.61s |  Cheers
1486.61s - 1491.29s |  And yeah, thank you for coming and sorry if you're expecting 45 minutes. Yeah. Yeah
1492.21s - 1495.94s |  Cheers
