0.00s - 4.16s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Uh, thank you for joining us here today. Uh, we are going to do intros in a second, but
4.16s - 8.46s |  overall, we're looking to give you some insight into the bug bounty world from three very
8.46s - 12.70s |  different perspectives on this, everywhere from running program management, running the
12.70s - 17.42s |  policy village here as well, or at least, uh, being very important regarding it, uh, all
17.42s - 22.58s |  the way through to black badge winners and everything in between for this. Uh, so to start
22.58s - 28.12s |  off, we'll do a few quick intros and then we'll chat through our overall agenda. Yeah. So
28.12s - 32.54s |  Katie, you're first up here. Hi everyone. Uh, I'm Katie Noble, uh, otherwise known as
32.54s - 38.68s |  lady in, I am the person for the policy village. So come see us in two 37. Um, so my
38.68s - 42.98s |  background is actually in behavioral analysis and, uh, I got into tech a couple of years
42.98s - 48.32s |  ago cause I was thrust into it by the government. Um, did, uh, worked for the government
48.32s - 53.86s |  for many, many years and I currently run, um, uh, the product security incident response
53.86s - 57.50s |  and bug bounty for a big fortune 50 company, but I'm not going to tell you which,
57.54s - 63.12s |  cause I don't represent them right now. Uh, this is not on the slides. Don't worry. Yeah. So,
63.12s - 67.78s |  uh, and my claim to fame is that in my career I've coordinated over 20,000 cyber security
67.78s - 78.90s |  vulnerabilities. Definitely can't top that. Uh, hi everyone. I'm Jonathan Cusco. Some of
78.90s - 83.60s |  you know me as bad idea. Um, I've kind of done both sides of being a full time bug bounty
83.60s - 87.54s |  hunter, also managing responsible disclosure programs. And so I've probably got the
87.58s - 91.34s |  intermediate experience here of like half her side, half of his side. Um, currently the
91.34s - 94.32s |  founder of chaotic good information security. My background is very much that of the
94.32s - 98.22s |  offensive security red team or penetration tester fully on the vulnerability front and
98.22s - 102.62s |  identifying what's truly vulnerable. How do we really fix it? And communicating that
102.62s - 106.02s |  across aisles, which is obviously sometimes difficult for engineers as they get a little
106.02s - 117.28s |  bit more up their craft. Cool. Um, hi, I'm Sam. Uh, I'm a security engineer at Google. Uh,
117.28s - 122.32s |  I help run, uh, one of our nine bug bounty programs, um, and our kind of core google.com bug
122.32s - 129.56s |  bounty program. Um, I have a couple of Defcon black badges. Uh, yeah, that's my kind of
129.56s - 131.06s |  claim to fame.
131.06s - 136.06s |  Alright. Hi everybody. I'm a senior security engineer at GitHub. I work on the bug bounty
139.66s - 145.38s |  program. I, uh, like to drive fast cars on curvy roads. I like to hit the track a lot, um,
145.38s - 150.28s |  when I'm not on the computer and I love building bug bounty programs, both private public
150.28s - 156.12s |  from nothing to full scope programs. And, uh, very excited to be here with you. Thank you.
156.12s - 165.12s |  And I am Logan. I work with Jeff also at GitHub helping run bug bounty over there at great
165.12s - 167.52s |  experiences working with everyone on the panel. And I think we're going to give you a
167.52s - 170.56s |  wonderful, a wonderful insight into everything going on here today.
171.46s - 179.46s |  Alright. So we're going to pose this as sort of, here's a question. We're going to let them
179.46s - 183.84s |  talk and Jeff and I are going to be hanging off to the side. So given that we're here to talk
183.84s - 188.00s |  about bug bounty, I mean, this seems like the obvious introduction. Uh, so Coast Coast,
188.00s - 192.94s |  we'll start with you on this one. What got you into the world of bug bounty originally?
192.94s - 197.04s |  So this is going to dial back about 10 or 12 years ago. Um, I started doing responsible
197.06s - 201.16s |  disclosure and bug bounty hunting as a very broke college student with over six figures of
201.16s - 206.00s |  student loan debt as it often happens here in the United States. I had my first penetration
206.00s - 209.58s |  testing job for a company, but the pay wasn't great. I didn't, I wasn't really like the best
209.58s - 213.44s |  at my craft. Um, you know, we started off a little bit lower and so I started moonlighting
213.44s - 218.22s |  bug bounties. Back at that time there was no hacker one, no bug crowd, no commercialized
218.22s - 223.16s |  sort of platform to, um, just bring you into it easily and get you in straight in front of
223.16s - 226.46s |  clients. So the thing that I was doing back then was actually looking at a lot of Google
226.52s - 231.82s |  acquisitions and the Google acquisitions would allow you to submit a vulnerability only
231.82s - 236.56s |  after they had owned it for six months. Um, pretty easy to find a list of acquisitions. Uh,
236.56s - 242.00s |  so I would find as many bounties as I could and then I sat on them until the six month part,
242.00s - 246.24s |  uh, scripted the submission to happen at 1201 that night. Sorry, I don't think you were there
246.24s - 252.38s |  at the time. Um, and that really got me into a lot of it back then, but my motivations were a
252.38s - 256.04s |  little bit split between one being like starving student trying to make his name in the
256.06s - 260.16s |  world. Um, obviously the financial implications of doing well in the bug bounty world can be
260.16s - 267.18s |  quite ludicrous. Uh, so I started doing that, um, while also just using that as a way to get
267.18s - 270.84s |  better at being a security engineer, at being a penetration tester. It's a little bit
270.84s - 274.18s |  different to take a client scoped engagement versus what's public out there on the real
274.18s - 277.12s |  world. So you get various different maturities. You see a lot of different technologies
277.12s - 281.56s |  really fast. Um, and I think that really expands your caliber as a bug bounty hunter, uh,
281.56s - 284.62s |  just to see how things work, how different people implement the same thing in different
284.64s - 289.02s |  ways. And you get a lot of real world wisdom and experience very, very quickly if you do
289.02s - 297.01s |  that over and over and over again, day after day. Who wants to pick it up from there? Um, so,
297.01s - 303.55s |  uh, I got in a little bit of a different way. So one of my, uh, teammates from DEF CON, uh,
303.55s - 306.69s |  reached out to me. I was like, Hey, I'm going to this live hacking event, uh, in New York
306.69s - 311.93s |  City. You should come down. I was in Boston, so in Boston. And so I went down there and I
311.95s - 318.15s |  participated in this live hacking event, only I was using curl. I wasn't using anything else. I
318.15s - 322.79s |  was, I knew exactly what everyone else was doing, but I was very, very slow. And so I made it my
322.79s - 329.77s |  mission to get faster, but then also to become a better bug bounty hunter. And fast forward a
329.77s - 332.41s |  couple of years, I didn't find anything there. Fast forward a couple of years, I actually won
332.41s - 337.57s |  one of the events. Um, so that, that was my kind of how I got into this and how I ramped up
337.59s - 345.30s |  from there. I guess that's me. Um, so my background, like I said, was government. Um, I
345.30s - 349.54s |  spent about 15 years in the US government doing various things. Like I said, my
349.54s - 354.22s |  background's in behavioral analysis, so it's all about why people do the things that they do. Um,
354.22s - 359.62s |  so I found myself at Homeland Security at the agency currently known as CISA. I was not CISA
359.62s - 365.96s |  when I was there. Um, but I was essentially moved into a position where I was acting as an
365.96s - 372.78s |  intermediary. So, um, researchers, hackers, come to, can come to the US government, even at
372.78s - 379.18s |  that time, and say like, hey, I'm being threatened by X company. Um, and it was my job to go to
379.18s - 384.22s |  that company and be like, what are you doing, man? Like, this is not going to work out. Um, and
384.22s - 388.22s |  you can threaten that hacker all you want, but I've got a fleet of lawyers, so go ahead and try
388.22s - 394.14s |  to threaten me. Um, and so I acted as an intermediary a lot, um, basically as a, I feel
394.14s - 399.42s |  like a camp counselor a lot. Um, which was great, because I could use all of my, uh, all of my, my
399.42s - 406.86s |  behavioral analysis background, um, to mediate a lot of, um, fairly high profile, um, uh,
406.86s - 412.46s |  vulnerabilities. A lot of the hackers that would come to us were very, very serious about, like,
412.46s - 416.64s |  they were looking at airplanes and nuclear power plants and water plants. These are very serious
416.64s - 423.78s |  things, um, that needed to be fixed. And so, that was really how I got into it, and then, uh,
423.78s - 429.26s |  eventually I moved out of government, um, into the private sector, um, running bug bounty
429.26s - 431.46s |  programs in the private sector.
431.46s - 437.50s |  So, wonderful. So, moving on, and thank God I have good notes here. Uh, one of the things you
437.50s - 441.44s |  had touched on, Sam, is, you know, starting with Curl and, and wanting to be faster and working
441.44s - 445.28s |  with everybody else. So, as you've gone through this, and I guess starting from the hacker side
445.34s - 449.72s |  and, and sort of looking at it from the response side as well, what, what tools, what techniques
449.72s - 453.12s |  have you found to be, uh, the most valuable when you're going through and actually doing bug
453.12s - 455.52s |  hunting? Without getting too, too in depth, because we are on the clock.
455.52s - 462.06s |  Um, yeah. So, for me, it's, it's mostly about, well, what makes you move faster, um, what makes
462.06s - 465.84s |  you find things, and more importantly, what makes you reject things that aren't interesting as
465.84s - 470.00s |  quick as possible. Um, and the faster you can do that, the more targets you can look at, um, the
470.00s - 474.74s |  more successful you'll be. Simultaneously, it's also important to use your tools to find other
474.74s - 480.34s |  targets, so, like, look for weird subdomains, look for weird places. Um, maybe pivoting this a
480.34s - 484.98s |  little bit on the program side, program management side, like, using templates to respond to
484.98s - 490.02s |  researchers, um, you'll often get the same invalid reports over and over again if you have to
490.02s - 497.02s |  write a custom response every time, like, it's just gonna slow you down. Um, yeah.
497.02s - 501.96s |  I'll take it from there. Um, so, I think it, first off, it depends on, like, what your particular
501.98s - 504.82s |  vertical of security is, because just by saying, like, what kind of pentester are you, it's, like,
504.82s - 508.66s |  saying, like, what, what do you do in cyber security, and, you know, there's a million different
508.66s - 512.20s |  verticals. Uh, can I, like, quickly ask the room, like, who are all the web application folks
512.20s - 517.20s |  here? Some, like, network, infrastructure, endpoint detection, okay, so it's kind of all
522.10s - 525.98s |  over the place, and so, like, saying, like, using Burp Suite to go really deep doesn't mean
525.98s - 529.94s |  much to someone who isn't an application security person. Um, and if you're someone who's
529.96s - 533.40s |  entirely in web application security, you might be a little deer in the headlights when you
533.40s - 538.44s |  find a command injection, and it's, like, okay, actually, like, pivot off that box. Um, when it
538.44s - 542.00s |  comes to the tools that you're using, I think more importantly than just, like, finding the
542.00s - 545.58s |  right tool that just helps, you know, find things automatically, you really need to align
545.58s - 549.68s |  that with what your particular vertical is and what you understand really well. Um, there's a
549.68s - 554.06s |  lot of opportunities to go deep in new areas of security that you might not be the best at.
554.06s - 558.76s |  Like, so, for instance, one of my weak points is, like, malware reversal. So, if I find
558.78s - 562.32s |  malware on a machine, I'm probably not going to spend 20 hours trying to figure out how to
562.32s - 565.22s |  reverse it. I'm going to find one of my friends who's really good at malware stuff and say,
565.22s - 572.06s |  hey, we're going to partner on this one so I can go back to what I do best. Um, yeah, a little
572.06s - 577.36s |  pivot, held a die on. I'm going to pivot further. Um, so, we're talking about technology
577.36s - 582.00s |  tools, but from my perspective, the best tools that we can have are really the behavioral kind
582.00s - 587.10s |  of tools, so, like, common sense I think is probably the best tool that I have available. Um,
587.16s - 590.88s |  I get a lot of reports from a lot of folks, and some of them are really high quality, really
590.88s - 597.46s |  good quality, um, criticality, and some of them are not. Um, and some of them seem like
597.46s - 601.80s |  they're social engineering or just not good quality reports until you actually start
601.80s - 606.50s |  digging into them. So, like, um, I always, like, make sure my engineers, like, really look at
606.50s - 612.40s |  that report because it could at first appearance be, like, incomplete or not, like, not well
612.40s - 616.74s |  formed or just garbage, but in reality, some of the very best critical vulnerabilities are in
616.74s - 621.92s |  that way. Um, even negative testing results are very valuable because negative testing
621.92s - 628.16s |  tells us where there is something, but it may not be ready yet, and so, common sense to me
628.16s - 631.92s |  is really important, and diligence is really important, um, and just being willing to
631.92s - 636.08s |  answer questions, like, uh, the thing that drives me crazy is when we get what I refer to as,
636.08s - 641.32s |  like, these cookie crumb results where it's, like, somebody will send a report in to us, and
641.32s - 646.18s |  it will be, like, pieces, and then we'll say, like, hey, do you have, like, can you give me
646.18s - 649.18s |  more information about this proof of concept, and they'll be, like, well, you're the company,
649.18s - 653.68s |  you figure it out, and it's, like, well, your report's probably going to go in the garbage
653.68s - 659.10s |  because I have 500 other reports, and you're taking time from those other hackers who took
659.10s - 662.48s |  the time to put the report together so that I could actually follow it so that I could pay
662.48s - 667.98s |  them out quickly, um, but we try to make sure that we are taking as much time as possible,
667.98s - 671.44s |  even with those reports, staying calm and going back to the researcher and being, like, hey,
671.44s - 675.68s |  look, I know you're frustrated, but, um, I think you have something here, but you need to
675.68s - 681.48s |  work with me to help me figure out what is here so that I can get you paid, um, so I would
681.48s - 685.40s |  say, like, common sense and due diligence are probably the best tools that I have in my
685.40s - 688.36s |  toolbox, um, from running a program side.
688.36s - 693.32s |  Real quick, before we move on, I want to make sure that, like, we actually give, like, good
693.32s - 696.52s |  answers for that one, too, because, like, what tools do you use if you're actually going to get
696.52s - 700.90s |  started? Um, any sort of man-in-the-middle intercepting proxy for your browser is
700.90s - 704.72s |  absolutely a must for application security. If you're needing to find new services on
704.72s - 708.22s |  endpoints, it's time to get really familiar with NMAP or NABU, if you're familiar with the
708.22s - 711.68s |  Project Discovery Toolkit. Everyone should just download everything that Project Discovery
711.68s - 716.68s |  has. It's free, it's open source, it'll really help you just get from recon to vulnerability
716.68s - 720.02s |  pretty quickly, and there's some nuance that you can learn there. Um, but you're going to
720.02s - 723.30s |  need tools that will help you go deep in an application, you're going to need tools that will
723.30s - 728.18s |  help you go wide across several applications, Nuclei is really good for that. Um, their
728.18s - 733.10s |  version of NMAP called NABU is also fantastic, and that will get you most of the way there.
733.10s - 737.02s |  At that point, I think you'll start having more hosts than you know what to do with, and this
737.02s - 740.32s |  is where you have to start determining, like, okay, where do I spend time, what do I put my
740.32s - 743.94s |  manual efforts towards, and I think the thing that you want to remember is that you're going to
743.94s - 748.18s |  want to use automation to help you find targets to then go in on manually, uh, because at
748.18s - 751.72s |  least when it comes to the bug bounty world, it's first and best dressed, and the reason I
751.72s - 754.68s |  wanted to talk about that is because exactly what you just said, you might get breadcrumb
754.68s - 758.48s |  vulnerabilities, and so let's say myself as the researcher, I found something that's really
758.48s - 762.68s |  cool, I'm pretty sure this is going to pay out, I can spend two hours putting together a
762.76s - 766.30s |  really good report, but in that two-hour time, someone else could put in a low-quality
766.30s - 769.76s |  report, yet they're first and they're going to get paid out, and so there's kind of like a meta
769.76s - 773.10s |  to bug bounty hunting where you have to decide, okay, how much information can I give that's
773.10s - 778.60s |  relevant, uh, to make this seem valid, and again, if you're competing with other people, I
778.60s - 781.80s |  might start thinking, maybe let me submit this incomplete, and then go back and edit it
781.80s - 785.76s |  later, can we start looking at submission dates, the first one is the only one that matters. Is
785.76s - 789.06s |  that the right thing to do? You know, I think we can have a discussion around that, but if
789.06s - 793.40s |  there was a meta to bug bounty hunting, that is definitely one part of it.
793.40s - 797.14s |  Just to add one thing to that, you'll never be faster, any tool you use will never be faster
797.14s - 802.72s |  than mass scan, so mass scan first, and then move on.
802.72s - 808.72s |  Awesome. Well, a great segue to that is, for Katie, where do human efforts provide value
808.72s - 813.86s |  than, more value than automation efforts, right, so pivoting off of tooling, where are
813.86s - 817.52s |  humans the most efficient, the most valuable?
817.52s - 823.48s |  Oh, Lord. So, I mean, I see a lot of, I've started to see a lot of AI generated reports come
823.48s - 831.48s |  in last year or two, and those are okay. From where I sit, like, I work mostly hardware
831.48s - 838.48s |  firmware and software, I don't work a lot of SAS, so the AI stuff isn't really valuable to us
838.48s - 842.22s |  because we're looking at, like, hard core CVEs versus, like, what I would consider to be
842.38s - 850.38s |  misconfigurations, so it is a little bit of a different ballgame, but I think it goes back
850.38s - 855.92s |  to, like, that negotiation period, right? Like, you can put in an empty, like, not an empty,
855.92s - 860.18s |  but a placeholder report, which we can have that conversation about whether you should or
860.18s - 868.18s |  not, but there is more to it than just lobbing the report over the wall. You're going to
869.18s - 875.00s |  enter a negotiation period, right? You're going to enter a negotiation period with the triager
875.00s - 878.34s |  who is receiving your report, you're probably going to enter a negotiation period, at
878.34s - 883.38s |  least in hardware and firmware, where you're going to have to work with an engineer or an
883.38s - 887.10s |  engineer is going to be working on the back end without your knowledge, which happens,
887.10s - 890.06s |  usually that's what's going on in that quiet period where they don't respond to you for
890.06s - 895.72s |  months, but they're working on trying to figure out a mitigation, right? And so that
895.72s - 902.02s |  negotiation, any time I walk into a room and it's, I want, if I want anything, even, like,
902.02s - 906.30s |  even ordering coffee, like, I want something, that's a negotiation. Congratulations,
906.30s - 911.88s |  you've just entered a negotiation. Because, and that's a human to human interaction. So
911.88s - 916.34s |  you can lob the report over the wall, but you're probably going to get a better result if
916.34s - 920.26s |  you walk into it understanding there's likely a human involved in there and you're about to
920.26s - 926.68s |  enter multiple phases of negotiation. So that's my suggestion.
926.68s - 930.60s |  One of the areas that I really like for human efforts over automated stuff is, like,
930.60s - 935.42s |  let's say a new target comes my way, I immediately skip everything unauthenticated, I skip
935.42s - 938.30s |  everything that would be the first one or two clicks away from whatever the main domain page
938.30s - 942.14s |  is, I go straight to anything behind credit card functionality, because that is always, I feel
942.14s - 945.34s |  like, what people put, like, on the last of their checklist, it's like, okay, I'm enumerating
945.34s - 949.60s |  the application, I'm enumerating whatever the target platform may be, and this bit requires a
949.60s - 952.60s |  credit card, and it can't just be a gift card, it has to be something valid, or maybe, like, an
952.60s - 956.72s |  ACH transfer has to happen overnight for them to confirm a balance, go straight to that, get
956.72s - 962.26s |  the clock running on it as soon as possible. Even if you need to go, I mean, I guess, like,
962.26s - 966.90s |  this is not financial advice, just in case that matters. Also not a lawyer, this is not legal
966.90s - 971.60s |  advice, all of those things. I have created separate accounts that I can use for all of
971.60s - 975.64s |  that, where I can add bank accounts, where I can add credit cards, it's separated from my
975.64s - 981.14s |  personal stuff, and the setup for that is, it's easier than installing the old version of
981.14s - 986.52s |  Bloodhound, if that's a bit of a deep cut, but, like, you should do that if you're remotely
986.52s - 991.18s |  serious about bug bounty hunting, because that's going to put you ahead of 80, 90 percent of
991.18s - 994.94s |  other people who are out there hunting for stuff being on the same login page, especially if
994.94s - 998.94s |  it's something where a new target has been exposed to everyone for the first time, and so you
998.94s - 1002.76s |  can imagine, like, maybe scope started at midnight, but you're racing with a lot of other
1002.76s - 1005.76s |  people around the world, and so you have to get to the functionality that other people are
1005.76s - 1010.68s |  likely to test last, if you want to get the low-hanging fruit first. Obviously you can go
1010.68s - 1014.34s |  deep, you can look at business logic analysis, wherever that sort of stuff comes in, I love
1014.34s - 1018.76s |  anything with a contact us form, anything that requires extra information to get to deeper
1018.76s - 1022.64s |  areas of the application, it's going to take automation even further to get to those areas,
1022.64s - 1026.14s |  and that's going to depend on how good whoever's automation is at spidering, which it's
1026.14s - 1029.88s |  already not good at maintaining authenticated versus unauthenticated states, as soon as
1029.88s - 1034.54s |  something hits, like, a logout feature, or you trigger rate limiting that logs you out, or
1034.54s - 1038.80s |  god forbid it's still a web sphere application, those have unique URLs every time you log in
1038.80s - 1042.58s |  or out, automation completely fails at those, and so when you start identifying those
1042.58s - 1046.30s |  technologies, I mean, I think the spider sense starts kicking in where you're like, okay,
1046.30s - 1050.80s |  there's likely not a lot of competition on this one, if I was going to spend eight hours
1050.80s - 1055.30s |  somewhere, this might be worth the time, because it's a lot of cost benefit analysis on
1055.30s - 1059.68s |  where your efforts are going to go, and it really sucks if you spend eight hours working
1059.68s - 1062.44s |  on something that you're pretty sure is vulnerable, you don't find anything, and now you
1062.44s - 1066.80s |  have a sunken cost fallacy sort of thought of what did I do with my day, which I think
1066.80s - 1069.72s |  we're going to get into that later question, so I don't want to go too much on it here, but
1069.72s - 1073.56s |  that's where I would spend human efforts over automation ones.
1073.56s - 1080.38s |  So just to add to the human effort, so when you're testing web applications and you come
1080.38s - 1084.68s |  across, like, a laugh, you'll often, it's an easy way to get yourself banned, especially
1084.68s - 1090.32s |  using automation, and so as a human, you have to, you have the ability to infer that
1090.32s - 1094.92s |  something is vulnerable without necessarily proving it using, like, a full exploit, that
1094.92s - 1100.00s |  would get your IP banned, that would get your account banned.
1100.00s - 1107.44s |  When I see a laugh, it doesn't actually, for some researchers, it can be, like, a showstopper.
1107.44s - 1111.04s |  For me, it's a place I'll actually dive in more, because, you know, you find the right
1111.04s - 1114.92s |  quote character, that's going to get past the laugh, and it might throw some interesting
1114.92s - 1122.12s |  error, you know, yeah, I see that as, like, really a place where humans thrive versus
1122.12s - 1123.12s |  AI.
1123.12s - 1129.48s |  You know, simultaneously, I'm sure AI will get better, or automation will get better.
1129.48s - 1132.80s |  When you find that a laugh has blacklisted you, don't forget about it.
1132.80s - 1136.88s |  If Akamai or CloudFlare or something has locked you out, write down that application, go back
1136.88s - 1141.52s |  to it later with a different IP, or lock out other IPs as you're scanning for everything,
1141.52s - 1144.04s |  because if you end up with a list of things that are behind CloudFlare and things that
1144.04s - 1148.00s |  are behind Akamai, guess where you should spend human efforts?
1148.00s - 1149.00s |  Exactly all of those.
1149.00s - 1154.84s |  This is also, like, a little bit in the weeds, but if you find yourself getting a laugh block
1154.84s - 1159.96s |  coming back from a server that's not Akamai or CloudFlare, that means that you have the
1159.96s - 1164.64s |  potential to DOS an application by blocking the frontend service sometimes.
1164.64s - 1165.64s |  I don't know.
1165.64s - 1171.07s |  It's a fun variant of this.
1171.07s - 1172.07s |  Very cool.
1172.07s - 1177.07s |  So it's easy to get in really deep and, you know, go into rabbit holes and eventually
1177.07s - 1180.71s |  also just get tired of responding to incidents, right?
1180.71s - 1182.03s |  How do you find balance?
1182.03s - 1188.31s |  What are some potential tips you can offer to folks, you know, who are proactively burning
1188.31s - 1190.39s |  out or, you know, how do you approach it?
1190.39s - 1193.47s |  I would love for Sam to start with this.
1193.47s - 1194.47s |  Sure.
1194.47s - 1199.35s |  So on the researcher side, I mean, it's the same as being at DEF CON.
1199.35s - 1200.87s |  I'm really excited to be here.
1200.87s - 1201.87s |  I don't want to sleep.
1201.87s - 1202.87s |  I don't want to eat.
1202.87s - 1206.95s |  I don't want to, well, I should shower.
1206.95s - 1209.59s |  It's everyone should shower.
1209.59s - 1210.99s |  It's the same thing with bug bounty hunting.
1210.99s - 1215.19s |  It can become very addictive and you have to balance it with the rest of your life.
1215.19s - 1220.11s |  You know, if you're having a bad week at work, maybe don't do bug bounty at night.
1220.11s - 1225.51s |  I think, like, simultaneously on the program side, if you're the only program manager and
1225.51s - 1229.79s |  you're getting in 25 reports a day, like, that's not sustainable.
1229.79s - 1234.51s |  You know, at least within Google, like, we try and go for, like, no heroes policy.
1234.51s - 1240.87s |  We have a roughly once every seven week or so rotation, a little bit less than that now,
1240.87s - 1246.31s |  I think, where you're only on call once out of every seven weeks, and that helps keep
1246.31s - 1247.31s |  things sane.
1247.31s - 1250.36s |  I'm next.
1250.36s - 1256.00s |  So, yeah, I agree, like, everything� every job, everything that you're passionate about,
1256.00s - 1260.68s |  you're going to, like, have burnout in from an industry perspective.
1260.68s - 1265.80s |  We have a lot of engineers that are sitting, receiving reports, doing triage, doing mitigation,
1265.80s - 1268.60s |  doing disclosure planning, and it gets really exhausting.
1268.60s - 1273.08s |  I had an engineer tell me the other day, you know, like, I have 75 tickets and I'm not
1273.08s - 1278.96s |  even happy when I close a ticket anymore because I know that I still have 74 tickets to close.
1278.96s - 1285.28s |  Like, she used to be, like, really excited every time she closed a report, and now not
1285.28s - 1286.28s |  so much.
1286.28s - 1287.28s |  And, like, that's real.
1287.28s - 1290.76s |  I think everyone is undermanned, especially with, like, a lot of the technology layoffs
1290.76s - 1296.28s |  that have happened in the last four to five years, like, being smarter about how we do
1296.28s - 1302.00s |  things, incorporating tools on how we actually handle vulnerabilities and disclosures I think
1302.00s - 1303.00s |  is really important.
1303.00s - 1307.04s |  Looking for efficiencies and building those efficiencies and automation into systems and
1307.04s - 1309.88s |  processes is incredibly important.
1309.88s - 1314.16s |  I would rather that� I see it kind of like a doctor's office, right?
1314.16s - 1320.92s |  I would rather that my doctors be doing surgery than filling out insurance forms.
1320.92s - 1329.48s |  So where you can offload onto, you know, a specific triage team, you should do that.
1329.48s - 1333.36s |  So your, you know, mitigation engineers are not doing triage and mitigation.
1333.36s - 1336.80s |  So it's about, like, balancing workload, balancing processes, making sure that you're looking
1336.80s - 1339.76s |  for automation opportunities.
1339.76s - 1342.16s |  And we do a rotation.
1342.16s - 1347.48s |  So our engineers will only do tickets for a certain amount of time.
1347.48s - 1350.68s |  So it's usually about three months, and then that's it.
1350.68s - 1352.56s |  They're not doing tickets again for another three months.
1352.56s - 1354.40s |  They move into an entirely different job.
1354.40s - 1358.80s |  So maybe today they're doing triage tickets, and when their three months is up, they're
1358.80s - 1362.98s |  doing comms, they're doing disclosures, they're doing something entirely different.
1362.98s - 1366.40s |  So that it doesn't matter that she has 74 tickets left.
1366.40s - 1370.24s |  That's now somebody else's problem for the next three months.
1370.32s - 1373.32s |  So we try to incorporate a rotation.
1373.32s - 1376.32s |  And we try to make sure that we're looking for those automation opportunities.
1376.32s - 1379.72s |  Technology has evolved and changed so much in the last several years that it's really
1379.72s - 1384.36s |  irresponsible if you're not on the industry side looking for ways to make the processes
1384.36s - 1388.60s |  better and easier and more efficient for your engineering team.
1388.60s - 1393.08s |  That makes things better and more efficient and faster for your bug hunters.
1393.08s - 1396.40s |  Faster that triage, the faster they get paid, the happier they are.
1396.40s - 1398.60s |  And then everyone is happy.
1398.60s - 1405.58s |  So I think it's irresponsible to not be thinking about your team health along with building
1405.58s - 1413.52s |  those processes, making sure you're efficient, and really just keeping an eye on your people.
1413.52s - 1416.00s |  Very well said.
1416.00s - 1417.64s |  So this thought kind of just crossed my mind.
1417.64s - 1420.72s |  I don't think any of us thought ten years ago that we'd get a dopamine hit from seeing
1420.72s - 1423.76s |  an alert box pop up.
1423.76s - 1427.68s |  And it feels just like pulling that slot machine, if we're going to make a gambling reference
1427.68s - 1432.80s |  because we're in Vegas, and just seeing something pop up.
1432.80s - 1433.80s |  Dopamine feels great.
1433.80s - 1437.56s |  And so the same thing, any time any scanner comes back as something that's positive and
1437.56s - 1442.24s |  then you verify and it's really there, that feeling of, oh, yes, I just got this thing
1442.24s - 1447.08s |  is just infectious.
1447.08s - 1450.16s |  Just like with anything that you enjoy doing, balance is absolutely key.
1450.16s - 1452.56s |  You have to keep a time on that clock.
1452.56s - 1456.68s |  Some of us have real addictive personalities and suddenly you find yourself, it's 4 a.m.,
1456.68s - 1461.64s |  we haven't had dinner, and you've got a lot to do the next day, but we can get real addicted
1461.64s - 1466.44s |  to hunting for vulnerabilities in new content, especially if you're going from application
1466.44s - 1469.04s |  to application to application, there's always something new.
1469.04s - 1472.88s |  There's always something, like some new rabbit hole that's pulling your interest or you're
1472.88s - 1475.92s |  working on one application because you've gone through so many, the light bulb pops
1475.92s - 1479.52s |  on something that you were touching an hour ago.
1479.52s - 1482.72s |  I should probably mention this with the tool bit earlier, but actually the best tool that
1482.72s - 1486.00s |  I have is a timer that I have on my desk.
1486.00s - 1487.92s |  And I tell myself the 15-minute rule.
1487.92s - 1491.92s |  So after I've been working on a particular area of an application or a target for just
1491.92s - 1496.20s |  a couple of minutes, if nothing has been immediately apparent that something is there, I start
1496.20s - 1497.20s |  the timer.
1497.20s - 1501.16s |  If that 15-minute timer goes off and I've not made any meaningful progress, go to the
1501.16s - 1506.68s |  next functionality or consider taking a break and stepping away from the computer.
1506.68s - 1509.68s |  That will help you find more vulnerabilities, too, because I can't tell you how many times
1509.68s - 1512.88s |  I've been on a page where I was just certain SQL injection is here.
1512.88s - 1515.16s |  There's just something I'm just not getting across.
1515.16s - 1516.16s |  It's not actually vulnerable.
1516.16s - 1519.04s |  And if you would have just gone to the next bit of functionality, there might be RCE there
1519.04s - 1522.68s |  or there might be some breadcrumb that's worth chasing down.
1522.68s - 1526.60s |  So manage your time effectively, just like anything else, this isn't specific to hacking.
1526.60s - 1531.48s |  This is the same advice for anyone who's seeking mental health wellness.
1531.48s - 1535.48s |  What we do is very exciting, it's very addicting, and those of us with addictive personalities
1535.48s - 1537.32s |  really need to keep a grasp on that.
1537.32s - 1543.32s |  Going back to the program side for a minute, you also control your own economy.
1543.32s - 1547.84s |  If you're getting in a ton of reports, consider lowering payments.
1547.84s - 1552.96s |  You'll still probably get a few reports in, but that might dissuade researchers from spending
1552.96s - 1553.96s |  as much time on your program.
1553.96s - 1558.48s |  Similarly, if you're not getting reports in, then pay more.
1558.48s - 1563.36s |  Control that input to some extent, anyways, and that kind of gets more to the business
1563.36s - 1564.36s |  side of everything.
1564.36s - 1567.57s |  But yeah.
1567.57s - 1568.57s |  Very cool.
1568.57s - 1571.65s |  So this is one of my personal favorite questions.
1571.65s - 1575.69s |  From a hacker view, what makes a product or an application a good target?
1575.69s - 1579.69s |  What makes a good candidate for a bug bounty program from the program side as well when
1579.69s - 1581.85s |  you're considering spinning up a program?
1581.85s - 1584.45s |  But we're going to start with Cusco's for this one.
1584.45s - 1585.45s |  Sure.
1585.45s - 1589.25s |  So, as much as I hate to say it, I'm going to say it.
1589.25s - 1593.45s |  We've all heard shift left a million times, and anyone working in security has heard this
1593.45s - 1597.29s |  sort of thing brought up, and the concept is basically the earlier that we can identify
1597.29s - 1602.17s |  bugs and fix them in the development life cycle, the cheaper it will be to remediate.
1602.17s - 1606.17s |  Bug bounty programs are as far right as possible as that shift left could be.
1606.17s - 1611.01s |  So when we're, as you're running a program, if you're identifying candidates for your
1611.01s - 1615.09s |  bug bounty program, it should be something that has already had all the gambits of internal
1615.09s - 1616.57s |  due diligence.
1616.57s - 1621.33s |  In an ideal world, you have secret scanning hooked into the CICD, you have rule sets for
1621.33s - 1624.29s |  insecure functions not being used, you're running some sort of SAS tool, you're running
1624.29s - 1627.37s |  some sort of DAS tool, you're running some sort of runtime analysis, and maybe if you're
1627.37s - 1631.41s |  lucky you have an internal pen testing team who can give it all once over assessment before
1631.41s - 1635.81s |  it actually goes out to production, you know, the real world.
1635.81s - 1640.49s |  Obviously that's a lot of resources, not everyone has a 200 person product security team, but
1640.49s - 1644.29s |  if you have something that has not gone through all those areas of due diligence and you're
1644.29s - 1648.81s |  going straight to making it a valid bug bounty target, that's fine.
1648.81s - 1653.45s |  That is just probably the most expensive way to get security improvements made on that
1653.45s - 1655.21s |  particular product.
1655.21s - 1661.01s |  At the same time, there's usually nothing academic or, you know, not real once it's
1661.01s - 1662.01s |  in production.
1662.01s - 1667.81s |  These are targeting customers now, actively impacting them, and again, it's not a theoretical
1667.81s - 1671.13s |  or academic finding, so usually there's movement to get it pushed out.
1671.13s - 1674.21s |  The other thing that I like doing, if I get multiple reports of the same thing, I treat
1674.21s - 1678.37s |  that as an increased likelihood of exploitation, so something, you know, if you get ten different
1678.37s - 1682.41s |  people telling you a thing is coming in and it's rated as a medium, well, if ten different
1682.41s - 1684.65s |  unique people can find it and they're not sharing that information, maybe that should
1684.65s - 1687.53s |  probably be a high and we shouldn't kick that down the can every three months as business
1687.53s - 1688.53s |  accepted risk.
1688.53s - 1691.25s |  But basically, it's kind of common sense stuff.
1691.25s - 1694.01s |  If you go straight to the bug bounty program, that is the most expensive way to identify
1694.01s - 1695.01s |  vulnerabilities on it.
1695.01s - 1698.05s |  There will probably be real good ones, though.
1698.05s - 1701.17s |  It could be more cost effective to do something a little bit more on the shift left sort of
1701.17s - 1703.17s |  pipeline, but that's just the reality of it.
1703.17s - 1709.85s |  Yeah, just to add to that a little bit, I feel like if you're getting the same critical
1709.85s - 1714.73s |  vulnerabilities in every month, then you're just paying that researcher's mortgage.
1714.73s - 1719.97s |  It's not, like, your role as a bug bounty program manager should be to push the business
1719.97s - 1725.05s |  to do more comprehensive fixes for things or to find every variant of this or to introduce
1725.05s - 1729.25s |  some additional scanning or something.
1729.25s - 1730.61s |  It's on you, the program manager, to make that happen.
1730.61s - 1735.17s |  The researcher is just going to keep submitting, you know, they're not interested in the systematic
1735.17s - 1736.17s |  fixes.
1738.64s - 1744.64s |  Yeah, I mean, like, the shift left thing is, you hear it all the time, but we're kind of
1744.64s - 1746.28s |  stuck with the roadmap, right?
1746.28s - 1750.32s |  So whatever product is coming on the market, and those products are based on customer-driven
1750.32s - 1751.32s |  needs, right?
1751.32s - 1756.24s |  So a customer wants this, this product is built, the product goes through testing, it
1756.24s - 1762.44s |  gets internal red teams, it gets lots of pen testing and security evaluations and hackathons
1762.44s - 1766.32s |  and whatever internally, and then it gets on the market, and that's where VDP comes
1766.32s - 1770.96s |  in place, so vulnerability disclosure, which is not usually paid, so that's your see something,
1770.96s - 1777.72s |  say something, and then and only then should it end up in the bug bounty space.
1777.72s - 1782.08s |  So bug bounty is true adversary emulation in my mind, and so you're looking at things
1782.08s - 1785.08s |  that are actively accessible.
1785.08s - 1791.88s |  But there are places where you can insert yourself into that product life cycle before
1791.88s - 1793.82s |  it gets on the market.
1793.82s - 1798.82s |  If you have a good researcher base that has really qualified and really awesome researchers
1798.82s - 1803.78s |  in that space that align with that target or that product, why not consider running
1803.78s - 1808.58s |  a private bug bounty event on that product before that product goes on the market?
1808.58s - 1813.06s |  You're likely to get really, really good results that way, because usually developers and hackers
1813.06s - 1817.66s |  have different mindsets, some are fixers and some are breakers, and if you approach it
1817.66s - 1822.70s |  from an adversary perspective, like most bug hunters do, you're likely to get really good
1822.70s - 1827.62s |  results that way, and then putting the bug hunters and the engineers in the same room,
1827.62s - 1830.46s |  I've had really good results with that.
1830.46s - 1836.62s |  Just sit them next to each other and let them challenge each other works really well.
1836.62s - 1842.02s |  So then I can get those products fixed before it ever even goes on the market, and then
1842.02s - 1845.94s |  at that point, then it goes through the rest of the process, product gets launched on the
1845.94s - 1850.62s |  market, problems have already been fixed, looks good for the company because you don't
1850.62s - 1857.38s |  have as many CBEs or negative reports or bad press, then product goes into VDP, and
1857.38s - 1860.46s |  then it goes into bug hunting, so bug bounty.
1860.46s - 1867.30s |  So I would say there are probably opportunities to insert one's bug bounty program into the
1867.30s - 1874.70s |  product life cycle, but when you think about from an industry perspective, there's a reason
1874.70s - 1880.14s |  that you have a bug bounty program, and that reason is so that you can take those vulnerability
1880.14s - 1883.90s |  reports that you get, you can analyze them, you can do trend analysis on them, and you
1883.90s - 1889.90s |  can force them back into your SDL, so your life cycle.
1889.90s - 1895.78s |  You want to not have that same kind of vulnerability pop up over and over again in succession or
1895.78s - 1899.14s |  in multiple products that use the same ingredients.
1899.14s - 1907.38s |  So if you don't do that part, then the only people who suffer are the product engineers
1907.38s - 1909.78s |  who are having to manage the reports on the other end.
1909.78s - 1913.70s |  So it's really important to integrate the bug bounty program back into the development
1913.70s - 1914.70s |  life cycle.
1914.70s - 1917.18s |  There are lots of ways to do that.
1917.18s - 1919.70s |  Chargebacks is one of my favorite.
1919.70s - 1924.44s |  For every payment that goes out to a bug hunter, you charge back the business unit that owns
1924.44s - 1928.30s |  that program.
1928.30s - 1932.50s |  So they feel the pain, that's the point, right?
1932.50s - 1937.78s |  If you don't know me, I've worked in this field for 20-something years.
1937.78s - 1940.42s |  I'm all out of carrots.
1940.42s - 1944.58s |  I only have sticks left.
1944.58s - 1949.10s |  So if the way to feel the pain and to make the change is going to be hitting someone's
1949.10s - 1953.78s |  pocketbook because that's what they understand, then that's what I'm going to do.
1953.78s - 1956.58s |  So it's all about completing that cycle, right?
1956.58s - 1961.86s |  If it gets to the end and you still have reports and those reports are the same reports over
1961.86s - 1968.34s |  and over again or the same template, then that template, that researcher is doing the
1968.34s - 1969.82s |  same thing over and over again.
1969.82s - 1973.74s |  They're finding multiple problems in multiple products, and we're playing whack-a-mole to
1973.74s - 1974.74s |  fix it.
1974.74s - 1976.86s |  That's not a good way to do it.
1976.86s - 1978.78s |  So that needs to go back to the red team.
1978.78s - 1982.30s |  The red team needs to go and fix all of those problems and all of those products and all
1982.30s - 1985.94s |  of those ingredients, and they need to be forced to do that sometimes.
1985.94s - 1991.42s |  So it's all about integrating and making sure that you're adequately using incentives both
1991.50s - 1993.90s |  on your bug side and on your internal side.
1993.90s - 1998.06s |  You know, real quick, you mentioned that there's only pain involved, but I don't think that's
1998.06s - 2002.50s |  pain from the bug hunter who is getting, you know, 30 different duplicates sent across
2002.50s - 2008.42s |  different targets and fishing for that payout 30X, which sometimes it's valid, sometimes
2008.42s - 2009.42s |  it's not.
2009.42s - 2010.42s |  What do you think?
2010.42s - 2015.62s |  It's pain whenever they've submitted 30 reports of the same they did the same thing 30 times
2015.62s - 2021.06s |  and got 30 different issues and then my team got wise to it and went back and did their
2021.74s - 2027.14s |  due diligence on all products and then suddenly that pipe is just dried up.
2027.14s - 2028.14s |  Which is ideal.
2028.14s - 2029.82s |  That's what we want.
2029.82s - 2033.78s |  So just to bring it back to bug bounty meta, something that I've done before, when I've
2033.78s - 2038.18s |  identified that you can find vulnerabilities on, let's say, 30 different products, do I
2038.18s - 2041.30s |  submit all 30 or do I submit two?
2041.30s - 2044.82s |  And then once those two get paid out, do I submit two more?
2044.82s - 2045.82s |  And so...
2045.82s - 2048.90s |  No, submit 30, because if you submit...
2048.90s - 2050.18s |  I get one payout.
2050.42s - 2051.42s |  No, not necessarily.
2051.42s - 2054.86s |  It depends on the program.
2054.86s - 2060.98s |  But if you submit two and then you wait, you've now given my engineers time to fix the product
2060.98s - 2067.22s |  in all the products, which means those 28 you were holding on to are no longer valid.
2067.22s - 2072.46s |  So I'm going to jump in for one second, because this is the perfect segue.
2072.46s - 2078.12s |  So talking about different ways to approach this, from both perspectives, what qualities
2078.12s - 2080.14s |  do the best programs for this have?
2080.14s - 2082.12s |  How are you doing that sort of dupe detection?
2082.12s - 2085.94s |  How are you playing that game and how are you finding the targets that you want?
2085.94s - 2089.34s |  And Katie, since I cut you off, you're the first person to take this one.
2089.34s - 2090.34s |  Oh, lord.
2090.34s - 2091.34s |  Okay.
2091.34s - 2092.34s |  What qualities?
2092.34s - 2093.34s |  Oh...
2093.34s - 2097.34s |  Well, now my train of thought's interrupted.
2097.34s - 2098.34s |  Chris goes...
2098.34s - 2099.34s |  Help me out.
2099.34s - 2102.22s |  Yeah, no problem.
2102.22s - 2106.90s |  So I think the general mantra for a program manager is to allocate budget towards the
2106.90s - 2109.72s |  areas that you want to reinforce behavior for.
2109.72s - 2114.04s |  So that can mean a couple of different things that are situational based on the bugs that
2114.04s - 2115.04s |  are coming in.
2115.04s - 2120.28s |  So if I'm running a program and one person has submitted, like, a template of vulnerability.
2120.28s - 2124.78s |  Let's say that I own a lot of infrastructure on the internet and they found something that
2124.78s - 2128.32s |  applies to a whole lot of those things.
2128.32s - 2133.32s |  I would appreciate knowing all of them at once as a bug bounty program manager.
2133.32s - 2138.36s |  But I also realize that, hey, this person could have given me one and I may have paid
2138.36s - 2139.82s |  them the same.
2139.82s - 2142.46s |  And so I think you need to reinforce the behavior that you want to see.
2142.46s - 2147.00s |  So if this is a good, high-quality researcher who gives great reports, they respond back
2147.00s - 2152.20s |  to you quickly, they're friendly, if you have the budget for it, pay them a multiple for
2152.20s - 2153.20s |  what it is.
2153.20s - 2158.08s |  Find a way to make whole based on the effort that they put into finding the thing.
2158.08s - 2161.16s |  And I think you can often see based on the report comes in, like, did someone run a scanner
2161.16s - 2164.80s |  for 30 minutes and stumble across something that is interesting and something we still
2164.80s - 2169.32s |  need to fix or did this require them going down the rabbit hole for two particular weeks
2169.32s - 2173.56s |  and then they found something really cool but maybe it's a one-to-many situation.
2173.56s - 2176.84s |  And not everyone has an infinite budget, so it's a little sticky there, but they probably
2176.84s - 2184.12s |  deserve more than a 1X payout, is it 2X, 4X, 8X, 20X, you know, half of what they submitted.
2184.12s - 2188.16s |  I think it's more important that you're fair and that good faith behavior goes both ways,
2188.16s - 2191.36s |  both as the researcher who's submitting the bug and saying, hey, I found a thing, I would
2191.36s - 2194.80s |  like something for what has been done, especially if you're going to make a code fix change
2194.80s - 2195.80s |  for any of that.
2195.80s - 2199.36s |  I think that's the general mantra, if you submit a bug, they make some change, it's
2199.36s - 2203.76s |  in scope, you should pay out, hill to die on.
2203.76s - 2206.44s |  But from the program manager's standpoint, it's going to depend on your budget.
2206.44s - 2210.36s |  You can't also just, like, bleed everything instantly because of this one thing that came
2210.36s - 2213.48s |  by because you might have a couple more quarters or the rest of the year to get through.
2213.48s - 2217.12s |  So you have to also, like, be the king that's managing your resources effectively as well
2217.12s - 2219.20s |  for your kingdom that is this bug bounty program.
2220.20s - 2222.20s |  How's that for seeding it and starting it off?
2222.20s - 2223.20s |  I appreciate that.
2223.20s - 2224.20s |  Yeah.
2224.20s - 2228.48s |  So, I mean, the best programs that I've seen are programs that are responsive, that have
2228.48s - 2232.52s |  interesting targets, that triage quickly, pay people quickly.
2232.52s - 2238.04s |  I've seen a lot of programs that don't really, they're kind of just templated, right?
2238.04s - 2243.16s |  They just took some, I don't mean to bash the platforms, but, like, they just did what
2243.16s - 2248.44s |  the platform said and followed that box, but they never really, like, thought about what
2248.44s - 2253.12s |  is my product and then what is the skill set that's needed in order to hack my product
2253.12s - 2257.36s |  and then how do I efficiently incentivize those skill sets, right?
2257.36s - 2259.76s |  So, like, I think there is something to the human element.
2259.76s - 2262.08s |  There's multiple kinds of researchers out there.
2262.08s - 2264.96s |  You have your traditional bug hunters that are motivated by the cash payout.
2264.96s - 2270.76s |  They're going to be happy to lob a report over the fence, and as long as they get paid,
2270.76s - 2271.76s |  they don't care.
2271.76s - 2274.92s |  They're not going to bother you about, like, disclosure windows or anything else.
2274.92s - 2279.12s |  Then you have recognition seekers, and I don't mean that negatively, but I mean people
2279.12s - 2282.36s |  who are, like, typically we see this in academics, right?
2282.36s - 2285.64s |  Academics often can't accept a bounty anyway, so they don't care.
2285.64s - 2288.20s |  They care about, can I talk about this at a conference?
2288.20s - 2290.60s |  Am I going to get my name next to a CBE for this?
2290.60s - 2298.12s |  They are looking for that, how do I make sure that I'm able to build my resume, build my
2298.12s - 2300.60s |  street cred based on my research, right?
2300.60s - 2304.24s |  So your academics are going to be, or your recognition seekers are going to be different
2304.24s - 2305.24s |  than your bug hunters.
2305.24s - 2307.20s |  They're going to be motivated by different things.
2307.20s - 2311.56s |  You have, like, friendly helpers, as we call them, so that's, like, government agencies
2311.56s - 2313.12s |  or sometimes other companies.
2313.12s - 2320.60s |  So sometimes my technology is similar to my competitor's technology, and if I get a report
2320.60s - 2325.80s |  that I know that impacts my competitor, I tell them.
2325.80s - 2330.80s |  We have a number, we call the bat line, and we say, hey, other company, this impacts me
2330.80s - 2333.56s |  and it probably impacts you too, and they do the same.
2333.56s - 2336.24s |  So those are kind of, like, friendly helpers, right?
2336.24s - 2341.48s |  So each one of those different kinds of motivations often requires a different kind of incentive.
2341.48s - 2345.88s |  So there's different things that you can do as a program to incentivize the skill set
2345.88s - 2348.16s |  that you want and the results that you want.
2348.16s - 2349.80s |  Payouts is one of them.
2349.80s - 2356.16s |  The other things that you can do are things like, we call it CPEs for CBEs, right?
2356.16s - 2358.36s |  So continuing education credits, right?
2358.36s - 2360.80s |  Like a lot of people have certifications.
2360.80s - 2366.60s |  And if you find a CBE, it's very easy for me as a bug bounty manager to literally write
2366.60s - 2371.44s |  out a certificate for that bug hunter, and they can take that back to whoever owns their,
2371.44s - 2376.56s |  you know, whether it's EC Council or ISACA or whoever owns that certification, and they
2376.56s - 2379.92s |  can get continuing education credits for the work that they do.
2379.92s - 2384.88s |  That's going to motivate some people more than a payout will.
2384.88s - 2387.76s |  Working with researchers to make sure that their timelines are met so they can talk at
2387.76s - 2392.48s |  a conference, or working with them to help improve their overall talk at a conference,
2392.48s - 2398.30s |  or working with them to help them improve their paper that's going to get published.
2398.30s - 2403.44s |  Those things are specific incentives that you can do to make sure that you're getting
2403.44s - 2405.48s |  the quality results.
2405.48s - 2408.92s |  So I think that the best bug bounty programs are responsive.
2408.92s - 2413.40s |  They're responsive to the needs of the product, and they're responsive to the needs of the
2413.40s - 2417.44s |  researchers or the constituents that they want to get those results from.
2417.44s - 2422.48s |  It's all about figuring out what that balance is.
2422.48s - 2426.04s |  Just to use, like, some concrete examples, maybe, like, as a program manager, like, do
2426.04s - 2429.60s |  you know who your top bug bounty hunters are?
2429.60s - 2431.24s |  Like what motivates them?
2431.24s - 2432.24s |  Why are they there?
2432.24s - 2438.16s |  And then similarly, as a program manager, like, do you know what matters to the business?
2438.16s - 2447.00s |  Like, going beyond CV or CVSS score, sorry, like, what is a crit, you know, to your business?
2447.00s - 2451.31s |  And it's not always RCE, necessarily.
2451.31s - 2453.91s |  Yeah, bonuses are delightful, too.
2453.91s - 2458.47s |  Just because, like, sometimes you get locked in this, like, legal world where there's a
2458.47s - 2463.03s |  definition of the word bounty, and you can have a bounty schedule, but your legal won't
2463.03s - 2468.07s |  let you change from what that bounty definition is, because it's tied to a specific thing
2468.07s - 2471.15s |  and it's tied to, like, what is the definition of vulnerability?
2471.15s - 2477.35s |  So you can be creative sometimes with payouts on things, like, if you change, kind of change
2477.35s - 2483.23s |  the definition and say this may not be a traditional vulnerability, which equals a CVE, which equals
2483.23s - 2488.83s |  this payout based on criticality, which is our process, you can sometimes say, like,
2488.83s - 2493.75s |  based on budget, will my company take action based on this report?
2493.75s - 2494.75s |  Right?
2494.75s - 2495.75s |  That's a guiding principle.
2495.75s - 2499.51s |  You can say, if my company will take action based on this report, then this report has
2499.51s - 2505.11s |  value to me, and then I have a set bonus scale, like, to what level will my company take action
2505.11s - 2506.11s |  on this report?
2506.11s - 2510.79s |  Will my company put out a document change and suddenly change the way that the security
2510.79s - 2512.23s |  guidance is applied?
2512.23s - 2516.79s |  Well, that might be worth a certain amount of money, and that's a bonus payment I can
2516.79s - 2521.85s |  pay to that researcher, because I appreciate their, I appreciate the work that they put
2521.85s - 2528.37s |  into finding that issue, security issue, and sending it to me, and so now I can fix
2528.37s - 2532.89s |  something that I didn't know was a problem, even if it's not a traditional patch.
2532.89s - 2538.93s |  So I think you should be creative in the ways that you think about what is a security harm
2538.93s - 2544.33s |  versus a vulnerability, and how do we reward positive behavior?
2544.33s - 2545.33s |  Swag motivates.
2545.33s - 2546.33s |  It helps.
2546.33s - 2547.33s |  All right.
2547.33s - 2549.80s |  Thank you.
2550.08s - 2551.08s |  Thank you.
2551.08s - 2555.96s |  So hopping on, sort of touching back on something Kuskos had mentioned earlier, and something
2555.96s - 2560.12s |  we've had a few talks on at DEF CON and AppSec Village and whatnot in the past, and yes,
2560.12s - 2562.52s |  we did skip a question.
2562.52s - 2566.52s |  What are your thoughts on bounty farming, and if you had to put a specific definition
2566.52s - 2572.44s |  or your spin on bounty farming, what would you qualify it as?
2572.44s - 2574.16s |  And Kuskos, this one's you to start.
2574.16s - 2575.16s |  All right.
2575.16s - 2579.08s |  So does anyone here not know what bounty farming is, just looking at the terminology?
2579.08s - 2580.08s |  Okay.
2580.08s - 2584.28s |  So let's say that you have a platform that is vulnerable to a particular thing, and that
2584.28s - 2588.20s |  platform is like a business-to-business sort of thing, so they themselves have customers
2588.20s - 2592.84s |  who are using that platform, those customers roll it out for their clients to use.
2592.84s - 2597.84s |  And so if the vulnerability exists in the platform, should I be reporting that vulnerability
2597.84s - 2600.76s |  to the main parent company, or to all the child companies who are running it who may
2600.76s - 2602.72s |  have their own security teams?
2602.72s - 2607.00s |  And so when that happens, you end up in this situation, and so again, one to many.
2607.00s - 2611.36s |  And so who is responsible for paying that bounty?
2611.36s - 2615.42s |  My personal thought is that the most, at least when we're talking about the fundamentals
2615.42s - 2619.34s |  of what happened, you've identified a risk, you've reported the risk, and does the entity
2619.34s - 2622.00s |  that you're reporting to agree that it is a risk?
2622.00s - 2623.00s |  Sometimes there's semantics involved.
2623.00s - 2626.26s |  You know, we try to do what we can with prioritization and threat levels, and just something to convey
2626.26s - 2629.44s |  across the aisle of if something is bad, how bad is it?
2629.44s - 2635.24s |  And obviously the game in this is we want to explain the situation in such a way to
2635.24s - 2638.72s |  where the damages are material, and we can remediate it.
2638.72s - 2643.84s |  If that company pushes a line of code or changes configuration in response to what you've provided,
2643.84s - 2648.24s |  I think that most people will agree that that person has earned a reward, whatever the reward
2648.24s - 2649.24s |  may be.
2649.24s - 2651.20s |  You know, if they have a budget, spend the budget towards it.
2651.20s - 2654.60s |  If they don't have a budget, at the very least some swag of some sort, or, you know, I've
2654.60s - 2658.40s |  done vulnerabilities, or I've reported vulnerabilities in place just so that I could be on, like,
2658.40s - 2660.44s |  a thank you page on their website.
2660.44s - 2664.64s |  Building the CD is material, too, for you.
2664.64s - 2668.64s |  Everyone should pay, and it's unfortunate when there becomes conflict there between
2668.64s - 2673.52s |  who it is, especially when you have platforms who often shift something out in a secure
2673.52s - 2677.92s |  by default way, or at least they've done their best attempt at secure by default.
2677.92s - 2681.96s |  The customer of that particular platform gets it, and they change settings so that their
2681.96s - 2683.52s |  users can log into it easier.
2683.52s - 2689.24s |  A great example is lack of 2FA, and I don't want to name any particular platforms.
2689.24s - 2690.24s |  Just think.
2690.24s - 2691.24s |  There's a lot of them.
2691.60s - 2695.88s |  Let's say that it shifts with 2FA enabled, and a strong password complexity.
2695.88s - 2699.92s |  That gets to the client who's buying that particular platform, and let's say that that
2699.92s - 2702.12s |  client has a non-technical user base.
2702.12s - 2706.20s |  Those user base don't want to use 2FA, or they don't want to use password managers for
2706.20s - 2709.28s |  high-entropy passwords, and so now you end up with a situation where you can have eight
2709.28s - 2714.08s |  lowercase characters as an extreme for a password, and some bug bounty hunter is saying, hey,
2714.08s - 2718.44s |  there's low password entropy here on this particular authentication mechanism.
2718.48s - 2721.92s |  If that particular instance is vulnerable, the main parent company for it shipped it
2721.92s - 2728.56s |  out by secure by default, they could have many child companies that are all doing this,
2728.56s - 2731.48s |  and so there is a vulnerability there, but is it really?
2731.48s - 2735.64s |  We get to the semantics argument, and when you find that situation, and I've found that
2735.64s - 2738.76s |  situation, when I'm typing up the report, I almost have to ask myself how much do I
2738.76s - 2744.56s |  want to spend in my time and effort arguing that it is something that should be changed,
2744.56s - 2749.04s |  especially if that particular business is doing it such that they can have customers
2749.04s - 2751.12s |  that use their platform a little bit more.
2751.12s - 2753.60s |  So there's a lot of nuance there.
2753.60s - 2757.80s |  I think that it goes back fundamentally to being accepting of people who are going to
2757.80s - 2760.52s |  bring risk to you, and then figuring out what you can do about it.
2760.52s - 2765.08s |  If there has to be some sort of, like, discussion between that particular client and the parent
2765.08s - 2768.08s |  company on who's going to pay out for it, unfortunately it needs to be had, and not
2768.08s - 2769.72s |  everyone has those dialogues for it.
2769.72s - 2773.28s |  I mean, you know, at best sometimes you have, like, customer service rep from node one talking
2773.28s - 2775.92s |  to customer service rep from node two.
2775.92s - 2779.36s |  Maybe one of them only has access to the security company, and there's just so much red tape
2779.36s - 2782.12s |  in the way that you're not going to get a practical solution in any meaningful amount
2782.12s - 2783.12s |  of time.
2783.12s - 2786.04s |  So what ends up happening is that that bounty researcher is frustrated.
2786.04s - 2788.64s |  They feel like they've spent a whole lot of effort on something, or maybe they haven't,
2788.64s - 2792.28s |  but they still typed up the report and brought something to your attention.
2792.28s - 2797.26s |  I don't think we have anyone who really says that, or I haven't seen, like, a thing was
2797.26s - 2801.68s |  shipped to us in this secure by default way, and then we've changed it, and we're not going
2801.68s - 2804.28s |  to you because it's part of how our business operates.
2804.28s - 2805.28s |  I've seen that.
2805.28s - 2806.28s |  Have you?
2806.28s - 2807.28s |  Yeah.
2807.28s - 2811.68s |  Because, and so I sit on the CVE board, just for full disclosure there.
2811.68s - 2818.38s |  So I've been a CVE board member for 10 years, and when we get into, like, traditional definition
2818.38s - 2822.68s |  of what is a vulnerability, what you're describing is a misconfiguration and not a vulnerability.
2822.68s - 2827.88s |  And so some companies will say that's a misconfiguration and not a vulnerability, because it was, the
2827.88s - 2832.04s |  device is operating as intended.
2832.04s - 2834.52s |  It's a shit secure practice, like, security practice.
2834.52s - 2840.36s |  Like, it's not a good practice, but it was set up that way to be that way because the
2840.36s - 2845.32s |  customer wanted it that way, and that's the implementation of the device, not the device.
2845.32s - 2846.76s |  So yeah, I've seen that.
2846.76s - 2847.76s |  Okay.
2847.76s - 2852.24s |  So let's say it's not a, let's get to something more practical, and like, okay, it's not,
2852.24s - 2853.24s |  it's not a misconfiguration.
2853.24s - 2856.64s |  The product's been shipped out, people are using it, and let's just say it's like cross-site
2856.64s - 2858.16s |  scripting on the login page.
2858.16s - 2861.60s |  So you know, improper user name, the user name comes back reflected with whatever input
2861.60s - 2866.28s |  the user gave it, and so now every installation of this is vulnerable to this particular thing.
2866.28s - 2868.40s |  What's that?
2868.40s - 2869.40s |  Still a misconfiguration.
2869.40s - 2870.40s |  Still a misconfiguration.
2870.40s - 2871.40s |  Okay.
2871.40s - 2876.54s |  Well, let's say that...
2876.54s - 2877.54s |  Log for chair.
2877.54s - 2880.66s |  Apache zero day.
2880.66s - 2882.70s |  All of those.
2882.70s - 2885.14s |  But something more tangible that affects all the different installations.
2885.26s - 2889.40s |  So each one should be racing to fix it, but they're likely going to have different security
2889.40s - 2891.26s |  maturity mechanisms.
2891.26s - 2894.58s |  The fastest way for something like that to get fixed, especially in a zero day situation,
2894.58s - 2898.98s |  is if the parent company fixes it at the platform level, and then that is automatically cascading
2898.98s - 2902.02s |  down to everyone who has their own installations of it.
2902.02s - 2905.14s |  Unless those are too custom, such that it can't accept the update, and I've seen that
2905.14s - 2907.22s |  happen before, too.
2907.22s - 2911.26s |  In that situation, my personal opinion is that the parent company should pay for it,
2911.26s - 2916.58s |  but then again, at that same time, is this a one-to-many payout, or is it a one-to-one?
2916.58s - 2919.98s |  Because let's say that you, reporting this vulnerability to the parent company, has fixed
2919.98s - 2923.74s |  a thousand different installations, and you wanted to have the argument that this was
2923.74s - 2929.53s |  like a thousand SQL injections, or a thousand RCEs.
2929.53s - 2933.99s |  So at least my view on this anyways is, like, if you're...
2933.99s - 2934.99s |  If you find it...
2934.99s - 2935.99s |  Using Apache as an example.
2935.99s - 2939.79s |  If you find a zero day on Apache, I want to hear about it, because it impacts my products.
2939.79s - 2944.31s |  If you're reporting a one day, as in something that's been...
2944.31s - 2947.83s |  A CVE has been issued for it, and a patch has been published, and we have to go pick
2947.83s - 2952.23s |  up the patch, it's probably already in our pipeline.
2952.23s - 2958.03s |  I like policies where there's a 30-day window, essentially, where the program has a chance
2958.03s - 2963.79s |  to fix things, and then you can go and report something after a certain amount of time.
2963.79s - 2969.35s |  But for original research, I think part of bug bounty is to incentivize that.
2969.35s - 2971.35s |  That's my view, anyways.
2971.35s - 2976.03s |  Yeah, I'd say it comes down to how well was your program terms written, right?
2976.03s - 2980.39s |  So every company that's running a bug bounty program should take the time to look at their
2980.39s - 2983.23s |  product and look at their bug bounty terms.
2983.23s - 2984.23s |  And if you have something...
2984.23s - 2990.47s |  I mean, you can eliminate those one-to-one, one-to-many, by simply saying that the vulnerability
2990.47s - 2996.03s |  is tied to the vulnerable code, not how many instances of the vulnerable code exist.
2996.03s - 3002.39s |  So you root cause it, basically, but you need to make that real clear in your terms well
3002.39s - 3005.99s |  before someone comes to you with that problem.
3005.99s - 3010.47s |  And that is something that can be thought about real early on.
3010.47s - 3011.55s |  It shouldn't be a surprise.
3011.55s - 3016.67s |  You shouldn't get a researcher submitting 100 tickets for the same kind of problem,
3016.67s - 3018.59s |  that roots down to one.
3018.59s - 3019.59s |  Submit all your tickets.
3019.71s - 3020.71s |  Don't do it two at a time.
3020.71s - 3025.55s |  All you're doing is screwing yourself.
3025.55s - 3026.55s |  Because it goes by the day.
3026.55s - 3027.55s |  I'm telling you, all you're doing is screwing yourself.
3027.55s - 3030.99s |  If you give me 30 tickets, and they're all different, substantially different, I'm going
3030.99s - 3034.79s |  to pay each one of those tickets, if you hold them, and then I fix that problem, and I've
3034.79s - 3039.95s |  just negated your entire research that you had on 28 other tickets, give them to me now.
3039.95s - 3042.59s |  Give me all the tickets.
3042.59s - 3043.59s |  But it...
3043.59s - 3044.59s |  Yeah.
3044.59s - 3047.95s |  I think the program terms are really important, right?
3047.99s - 3051.71s |  So, like, thinking through your use cases and thinking through, like, this could happen,
3051.71s - 3055.43s |  and I need to be very clear with my researchers before they ever start working on my product
3055.43s - 3058.03s |  that these are the terms that are going to get paid out, and I can't be changing the
3058.03s - 3061.23s |  game halfway through after they've submitted a report.
3061.23s - 3062.55s |  Like, that's not cool.
3062.55s - 3063.55s |  That's not kosher.
3063.55s - 3064.55s |  You don't do that.
3064.55s - 3065.55s |  They submitted the report.
3065.55s - 3067.47s |  You pay the report under the terms that currently exist.
3067.47s - 3069.91s |  You change your terms later, well, then you have a cutoff date.
3069.91s - 3073.63s |  You say anything comes past this time is going to be subject to these terms.
3073.63s - 3075.35s |  But if you submitted it before, then you fall.
3075.35s - 3077.47s |  Like, it's just being fair and being honest and being decent.
3077.99s - 3078.99s |  Like, so you build that trust.
3078.99s - 3082.99s |  If you don't have that trust, then why would a researcher submit the vulnerability to you
3082.99s - 3085.11s |  and not sell it?
3085.11s - 3088.03s |  So do the right thing and build trust.
3088.03s - 3091.83s |  So again, because the title of this whole panel is the realities of bug bounty life,
3091.83s - 3098.55s |  I want to go back to what are the realities, what are my incentives to actually report
3098.55s - 3103.35s |  this to the main parent program, which, let's say, okay, they're either going to pay nothing
3103.43s - 3108.03s |  or they'll treat it as one valid unique thing and they luck out by fixing it and it fixes
3108.03s - 3111.59s |  all the other multiple installations that are wrong.
3111.59s - 3112.59s |  Or incorrect, rather.
3112.59s - 3113.59s |  Not wrong.
3113.59s - 3114.59s |  Security is hard to do.
3114.59s - 3119.07s |  We want to be very blameless about remediation.
3119.07s - 3123.63s |  I can either not get paid or get paid or maybe get paid a multiple if I submit it to the
3123.63s - 3124.91s |  parent company.
3124.91s - 3129.91s |  If they have a child company who's using that platform and they have a security team, I
3129.91s - 3132.11s |  can submit it to them and the exact same thing may happen.
3132.11s - 3133.11s |  Read the terms.
3133.11s - 3134.11s |  Read the terms.
3134.11s - 3135.11s |  And I should read the terms.
3135.11s - 3137.43s |  And get as many vulnerabilities as you can.
3137.43s - 3138.43s |  Read all the terms.
3138.43s - 3139.43s |  I promise.
3139.43s - 3140.67s |  I'm getting to this.
3140.67s - 3144.19s |  We as bug bounty program managers, we know who's bounty farming.
3144.19s - 3145.19s |  We talk to each other.
3145.19s - 3146.63s |  We're all doing the same thing.
3146.63s - 3150.43s |  And if you submit a vulnerability to ten different security programs that is all basically the
3150.43s - 3154.19s |  same thing, I'm just going to throw WordPress out there because there's a million WordPress
3154.19s - 3156.19s |  installations and nearly every company is using it to some degree.
3156.19s - 3159.27s |  If you find a WordPress vulnerability, instead of submitting it to WordPress and instead
3159.27s - 3163.03s |  you submit it to a company who's using it, they may pay out.
3163.03s - 3164.03s |  This one may pay out.
3164.03s - 3165.03s |  This one may pay out.
3165.03s - 3167.23s |  And then the next thing you know, we're like, hey, I'm getting all these reports for WordPress.
3167.23s - 3168.75s |  Oh, I got that too.
3168.75s - 3172.33s |  Oh, this person is bounty farming.
3172.33s - 3174.43s |  We understand why it happens.
3174.43s - 3178.35s |  But also, I don't think you're going to win any good favors with the people who are inviting
3178.35s - 3181.07s |  you to programs who are trying to create good targets for you.
3181.07s - 3185.03s |  And so, like, intent really is everything there and it should be both ways.
3185.03s - 3188.47s |  Both from the researcher side, it's probably an unethical thing to do, but again, it is
3188.47s - 3189.47s |  the reality.
3189.47s - 3190.47s |  It probably happens.
3190.47s - 3193.15s |  Also, they might be younger in their career and not know there's a parent company doing
3193.15s - 3194.51s |  it.
3194.51s - 3198.87s |  Maybe they've found some, you know, there's a single sign-on, for instance, and they've
3198.87s - 3203.07s |  found an issue with a particular single sign-on instance for one particular product, not knowing
3203.07s - 3205.07s |  that, like, it's Okta behind the scenes or something.
3205.07s - 3206.71s |  It's not always very apparent.
3206.71s - 3209.47s |  It often is, but it doesn't have to be.
3209.47s - 3212.59s |  How do they know that that should go to, like, the main SSO provider?
3212.59s - 3216.35s |  And so, I think it comes down to giving them an opportunity to kind of just, like, state
3216.35s - 3219.43s |  their case, and if they've found a multiple thing that applies to many things, that's
3219.43s - 3220.43s |  fine.
3220.43s - 3225.19s |  Like, I know someone who knows, like, some really cool exploits with headless Chrome
3225.19s - 3226.63s |  browsers.
3226.63s - 3230.15s |  And so, anywhere where he sees that feature operating in an application, yeah, that should
3230.15s - 3235.67s |  be fair game for him to go seek it out, because the configuration of that particular product
3235.67s - 3237.59s |  might be different than the product itself.
3237.59s - 3240.71s |  Again, it just comes down to intent and good faith, researcher.
3240.71s - 3241.71s |  State your case.
3241.71s - 3244.63s |  Know, you know you're doing something bad if you're doing it, and the people on the
3244.63s - 3248.47s |  receiving end will become wise to it eventually.
3248.47s - 3249.47s |  That is the reality of it.
3249.47s - 3250.47s |  I'm going to differentiate.
3250.47s - 3254.11s |  I know we've got to wrap up, but I'm just going to say real quick, hate the game, not
3254.11s - 3255.11s |  the player.
3255.11s - 3256.11s |  Yeah.
3256.11s - 3260.35s |  I run a bug bounty program at a company, right?
3260.35s - 3262.31s |  Like, we all talk to each other.
3262.31s - 3264.31s |  There's a whole big community of bug bounty managers.
3264.31s - 3265.31s |  We have honest conversations.
3265.31s - 3268.99s |  All of us are part of it.
3268.99s - 3274.91s |  But if you find it, submit it, like, if you get paid out twice, you get paid out twice.
3274.91s - 3276.39s |  If you get paid out ten times, you get paid out ten times.
3276.39s - 3280.11s |  I'm not going to hate somebody because they submitted it to me and then they submitted
3280.11s - 3282.27s |  it to a competitor and they submitted it to somebody else.
3282.27s - 3283.27s |  Like, okay.
3283.27s - 3285.27s |  I'm going to stick in my lane.
3285.27s - 3288.67s |  I'm going to pay the stuff that I agreed to have paid to.
3288.67s - 3289.95s |  So hate the game.
3289.95s - 3290.95s |  Don't hate the player.
3290.95s - 3294.91s |  But at the same time, if the company says, sorry, this isn't my product because this
3294.91s - 3298.63s |  is actually this parent company's product, don't fight that.
3299.27s - 3301.11s |  Just let it go.
3301.11s - 3304.19s |  Because it's not going to be worth anybody's time fighting it and you're just going to
3304.19s - 3305.95s |  lose any good will you had.
3305.95s - 3309.07s |  I do also think that if that happens, you know, in the interest of trying to create
3309.07s - 3313.83s |  a strong community around this and bringing legitimacy to it, that company probably has
3313.83s - 3318.59s |  stepped into some era of responsibility for walking that up the chain, seeing if it will
3318.59s - 3320.99s |  be valid for that other particular program.
3320.99s - 3322.79s |  And bug bounties are not taboo anymore.
3322.79s - 3326.99s |  We're ten years into this maturing as its own particular vertical of security.
3327.99s - 3330.99s |  If you notice that a company doesn't have a responsible disclosure program, I'm pretty
3330.99s - 3332.83s |  sure they're considered less than.
3332.83s - 3336.59s |  Now there are very tactful ways for us to have that conversation as part of a maturity
3336.59s - 3342.31s |  effort and growing what you're trying to protect your customers from becoming exploited towards.
3342.31s - 3346.79s |  But I do think that that whichever company gets the thing that says, hey, this isn't
3346.79s - 3350.67s |  my problem, it's someone else's, would probably be behooved to walk that up the chain and
3350.67s - 3354.67s |  see if they can redirect that researcher to a good program.
3354.67s - 3357.43s |  The same way that we ask for researchers to be good-faith researchers, I think that
3357.43s - 3358.83s |  we should be good-faith program managers.
3358.83s - 3363.03s |  Yeah, don't just close the report and be like, not my problem.
3363.03s - 3366.31s |  Close the report and tell the researcher, hey, not my problem, I can't fix this, but
3366.31s - 3370.15s |  you should go talk to this person at this company because they have a bug bounty program
3370.15s - 3372.95s |  and your report is valid for them.
3372.95s - 3377.11s |  It takes just a little bit more time to do that, and it's going to probably save the
3377.11s - 3381.51s |  relationship between the researcher and the company by doing that.
3381.51s - 3382.51s |  All right.
3382.55s - 3384.63s |  And that is perfect because we're going to end right on time.
3384.63s - 3386.83s |  Obviously, we don't have time for Q&A.
3386.83s - 3390.19s |  If you do want to chat with any of us, find us out in the hall right afterwards.
3390.19s - 3391.75s |  Thank you, and here's how you can get in touch with everybody.
