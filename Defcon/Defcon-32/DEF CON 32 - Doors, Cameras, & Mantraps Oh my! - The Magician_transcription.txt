0.00s - 3.52s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 So it turns out that the slides are not going to be up here,
3.52s - 6.80s |  but what I'm going to do is record my talk later
6.80s - 9.04s |  and put it up on YouTube and share it on Twitter,
9.04s - 12.12s |  so you all will get to see the slides.
12.12s - 14.64s |  I'll probably just share the slides, that would be cool.
14.64s - 18.84s |  All right, so my name is The Magician.
18.84s - 21.52s |  This talk is Doors, Cameras, and Mantraps, Oh My!
21.52s - 23.20s |  It is not a lockpicking talk,
23.20s - 24.64s |  if that's what you're here for.
24.64s - 28.20s |  This is a talk more about physical security
28.24s - 31.52s |  and the practical business aspects of security
31.52s - 34.68s |  in the PhysSec world and how to talk to clients
34.68s - 35.88s |  and how you want to get into it,
35.88s - 37.88s |  if that's something you're interested in.
39.44s - 46.54s |  So, hi, nice to meet you all.
46.54s - 53.36s |  I've got my notes here, even though you don't have slides.
53.36s - 55.60s |  I'm a member of the Open Organization of Lockpickers.
55.60s - 59.08s |  If you all have gone and picked locks at Lockpick Village,
59.08s - 61.76s |  then that's the tool group, those are my people.
61.76s - 63.36s |  Let them know The Magician sent you
63.36s - 66.88s |  and they'll set you up with some locks and some picks.
66.88s - 69.76s |  I was a physical security assessor
69.76s - 72.04s |  for Gold Sky Cybersecurity,
72.04s - 74.16s |  and they used to send me around the United States
74.16s - 76.44s |  and break into buildings, and I would show people
76.44s - 79.24s |  how I would break into their buildings with them,
79.24s - 81.36s |  so they could try it, learn it,
81.36s - 83.32s |  and the mitigation rate was much higher
83.32s - 88.24s |  because then they understood how to do the physical exploit.
90.12s - 93.20s |  Physical security still is a huge hobby for me,
94.04s - 96.68s |  even though I'm not doing it professionally anymore.
96.68s - 98.72s |  What I did was super straightforward.
98.72s - 100.56s |  I would bring people around the building
100.56s - 103.00s |  that they worked in, and I would teach them
103.00s - 105.40s |  how to break into their own facility.
105.40s - 108.36s |  Bringing the client with me gave them the option
108.36s - 112.20s |  to try it themselves, and often the mitigation rate
112.20s - 113.12s |  was much higher.
115.96s - 119.68s |  Show and tell is basically what it came down to.
119.68s - 123.12s |  I would show people what their vulnerabilities were,
124.04s - 125.52s |  explain to them how to run the exploit
125.52s - 127.28s |  so they could try it themselves,
127.28s - 130.28s |  and then I would tell the people that had hired me
130.28s - 133.20s |  what the problems were, what I showed their team,
133.20s - 137.73s |  and how to get those things fixed.
137.73s - 141.53s |  What this talk will cover is physical security controls,
141.53s - 144.49s |  key questions that I use to ask clients,
144.49s - 146.65s |  how to educate your clients without fear,
146.65s - 148.53s |  uncertainty, and doubt,
148.53s - 151.09s |  and how you can learn physical security
151.09s - 162.10s |  if you want to get into it as a career field.
162.10s - 164.86s |  Physical security controls are the first topic
164.86s - 167.78s |  of conversation, and I'd like to start with doors.
167.78s - 169.54s |  More often than not, that's the first thing
169.54s - 170.70s |  you're going to test.
174.42s - 177.62s |  There are a lot of mechanical components to doors,
177.62s - 179.54s |  but here's the short list.
179.54s - 181.62s |  Do perimeter doors have hinges
181.62s - 183.66s |  that are exposed to the outside?
183.66s - 185.90s |  Those hinges can be exploited.
185.90s - 187.78s |  Can I slide something between the latch
187.78s - 191.10s |  and the strike plate to pull the door open
191.10s - 193.18s |  without a key or combination?
194.06s - 196.18s |  Can I get tools over or under the door
196.18s - 199.02s |  to manipulate the door handles from the outside?
199.02s - 201.66s |  If I can run across double doors,
201.66s - 203.26s |  can I manipulate crash bars,
203.26s - 206.78s |  which are the bars that you shove open in server rooms?
206.78s - 214.75s |  These are all resolvable exploits.
214.75s - 217.11s |  Windows are the next physical security control
217.11s - 219.51s |  I used to look at, and they're often overlooked.
220.51s - 225.23s |  Insecure windows can be opened or manipulated
225.23s - 227.23s |  in similar ways to doors.
227.23s - 229.35s |  They offer different challenges.
229.35s - 230.95s |  In a lot of office spaces,
230.95s - 235.27s |  some clients don't have policies about shoulder surfing
235.27s - 237.75s |  or looking over the shoulder of a user
237.75s - 239.43s |  to obtain information.
240.47s - 245.47s |  This is a low-complexity physical security risk,
245.75s - 248.55s |  and if someone is trying to establish
248.55s - 250.71s |  operating hours of a business,
250.71s - 252.95s |  PC operating systems used,
252.95s - 254.95s |  or even information like browser type,
255.63s - 256.47s |  looking through a window
256.47s - 261.38s |  is extremely low effort and high yield.
261.38s - 264.46s |  Fencing seems obvious at first.
264.46s - 267.82s |  Maybe folks have them in their homes or at office sites.
267.82s - 270.82s |  Fencing establishes a clear perimeter
270.82s - 273.98s |  and clearly sets an expectation of limited access.
274.82s - 276.62s |  It would take a heck of an improviser
276.62s - 278.30s |  to explain to a guard
278.30s - 281.34s |  why you were walking around a parking lot or building
281.34s - 283.66s |  at a locked and closed site.
283.66s - 286.18s |  It's also near impossible to scale a fence
286.18s - 288.22s |  in most environments during the day
288.22s - 289.86s |  without attracting attention.
290.78s - 293.66s |  Fencing is a passive security means,
293.66s - 303.74s |  meaning it doesn't require any labor.
303.74s - 306.30s |  Bollards are a great security control.
307.54s - 309.54s |  You've all seen bollards before.
309.54s - 311.06s |  They're reinforced obstacles
311.06s - 314.02s |  that prevent the use of a vehicle as a battering ram
314.02s - 315.42s |  to create a point of entry
315.42s - 318.14s |  in an otherwise defended structure.
319.02s - 325.08s |  It's another passive security risk mitigation.
325.12s - 328.76s |  Mantraps, I think, are completely underutilized.
328.76s - 332.16s |  You likely have seen these secure facilities
332.16s - 335.12s |  where a room has two separate doors
335.12s - 338.36s |  and typically two separate security access controls.
339.24s - 342.12s |  For instance, one door has an RFID badge
342.12s - 343.48s |  and a separate security door
343.48s - 345.56s |  on the opposite side of the room
345.56s - 347.96s |  has a biometric security control,
347.96s - 349.24s |  like a fingerprint reader.
350.08s - 351.48s |  These require some setup
351.48s - 354.36s |  and require adherence to procedure.
354.36s - 355.80s |  Additionally, it can be a challenge
355.80s - 358.80s |  to get a flow of people through mantraps,
358.80s - 361.00s |  but they are an awesome control
361.00s - 365.39s |  and typically you'll see them at banks.
365.39s - 370.39s |  Cameras are in most businesses and some homes now.
372.35s - 374.83s |  If you have the funding at a job site,
374.83s - 377.35s |  you can even have your camera actively monitored
377.35s - 379.03s |  in a security operating center.
380.31s - 384.79s |  Lots of small to midsize businesses just record video
384.79s - 386.99s |  and reference it in incident response
386.99s - 391.03s |  if something goes wrong or for forensic purposes.
391.03s - 393.83s |  There are many technologies in the world of cameras,
393.83s - 396.31s |  but I firmly believe that Wi-Fi cameras
396.31s - 399.83s |  are a poor choice in many environments.
399.83s - 401.59s |  Please reach out to me
401.59s - 403.43s |  if you wanna hear that soapbox rant.
405.11s - 407.19s |  Electronic access is a really cool area
407.19s - 408.91s |  of security controls,
408.91s - 412.03s |  especially in the world where now everyone has a Flipper Zero.
413.03s - 416.11s |  Most of you have some form of token
416.11s - 418.79s |  that your office has given you to get into your building,
418.79s - 422.31s |  an RFID badge you wave in front of a reader
422.31s - 424.19s |  that opens the door maybe.
424.19s - 429.19s |  RFID and NFC are great and they're getting better,
431.59s - 433.63s |  but the availability of the Flipper Zero
433.63s - 435.83s |  makes these not necessarily the best way
435.83s - 439.39s |  to get into a building as an only means of access.
439.39s - 441.47s |  A pin code might be functional,
441.91s - 443.39s |  but if somebody can obtain that
443.39s - 445.91s |  by observing you entering the pin code,
445.91s - 449.51s |  that isn't necessarily a great means of access either.
449.51s - 451.99s |  I'm one of the many cyborgs in the hacker community
451.99s - 454.67s |  and I got an implant from Dangerous Things,
454.67s - 458.23s |  so my left hand is RFID and NFC compatible,
458.23s - 460.11s |  so I don't need a right to a badge,
460.11s - 465.10s |  I can write to my hand.
465.10s - 466.22s |  What matters though?
467.74s - 470.50s |  Knowing what matters to a particular entity
470.50s - 472.46s |  is of extreme importance.
472.46s - 475.30s |  I've done four minute break-ins
475.30s - 477.58s |  from parking lot to server room
477.58s - 479.46s |  and had clients tell me that
479.46s - 482.06s |  actually all of their information is in the cloud,
482.06s - 483.98s |  those servers are just dev environments
483.98s - 487.30s |  and the hard drives are encrypted, so they don't care.
487.30s - 489.58s |  So knowing what is important to your clients
489.58s - 494.12s |  is of critical importance.
494.12s - 495.76s |  Access from the perimeter is something
495.76s - 498.04s |  you actually want to talk to your client about,
498.04s - 500.36s |  not just exploring it yourself.
500.36s - 502.36s |  You wanna make sure that you're getting access
502.36s - 505.44s |  to all the doors that they want you to have access to.
505.44s - 507.32s |  There isn't any shame in saying,
507.32s - 510.52s |  can you please show me your physical infrastructure
510.52s - 514.36s |  and where all the doors are that are of a concern to you?
514.36s - 516.40s |  Then you can be sure that you're tackling
516.40s - 518.00s |  all that client's concerns.
518.92s - 520.92s |  Conversely, there might be doors
520.92s - 522.64s |  that they don't think are a concern
522.64s - 527.35s |  that you probably should bring to their attention.
527.35s - 529.59s |  Because you are truly treated as a guest
529.59s - 532.67s |  in the scenario of a security risk assessor,
532.67s - 536.11s |  you can test guest badge policies firsthand.
536.11s - 539.15s |  In some cases, if it's in scope,
539.15s - 543.63s |  you can try enticing the client to give you a guest badge
543.63s - 548.19s |  and asking them if it's okay for you to go to the restroom.
548.19s - 551.47s |  Many times you can find yourself in the office of a CEO
551.47s - 554.71s |  or a CFO without any kind of supervision,
554.71s - 557.11s |  sometimes hours after you were let in,
557.11s - 561.13s |  without anyone hassling you.
561.13s - 563.17s |  As a social engineering enthusiast,
563.17s - 564.93s |  this is a huge topic.
566.25s - 568.45s |  Entire companies are dedicated
568.45s - 571.33s |  to just educating and empowering employees
571.33s - 575.17s |  to ask as part of the security team for a company.
575.17s - 576.73s |  There are quick points,
576.73s - 578.97s |  here are some quick points to the matter.
578.97s - 581.41s |  Gamify your security training.
581.41s - 584.69s |  A traveling trophy can go to the desk of a person
584.69s - 587.85s |  with the least clicks in an email phish,
587.85s - 590.41s |  or maybe to someone who always locks their computer
590.41s - 592.77s |  when they get up to go to the break room.
593.37s - 595.01s |  Be creative and let employees know
595.01s - 597.33s |  that they are an integral part to your security
597.33s - 598.65s |  at the company,
598.65s - 601.05s |  and that they can be a huge line of defense.
601.05s - 605.44s |  Every employee is part of the security team.
605.44s - 608.04s |  Constructive criticism is always better
608.04s - 609.60s |  than belittling somebody
609.60s - 611.92s |  for their lack of security knowledge.
611.92s - 613.84s |  How can you talk to a client?
613.84s - 615.64s |  How you talk to a client will determine
615.64s - 617.92s |  how they mitigate your findings.
617.92s - 620.28s |  While there have been tons of technical talks
620.28s - 623.60s |  about how to exploit mechanical components
623.60s - 625.16s |  of physical security,
625.16s - 627.80s |  there have been just a few that cover the specifics
627.80s - 629.20s |  of educating clients
629.20s - 631.44s |  on how to go about resolving their exploits.
633.24s - 635.04s |  Saying things like this is really bad,
635.04s - 636.68s |  need to be replaced with,
636.68s - 638.68s |  we have some really good opportunities here
638.68s - 640.24s |  for positive change.
640.24s - 642.80s |  Simple phrasing can mean a world of difference
642.80s - 647.80s |  and can lead to a very different side of client morale,
648.12s - 650.56s |  and also can determine whether or not
650.56s - 655.72s |  they're going to hire you next year.
656.72s - 658.72s |  The show and tell was always my favorite part,
658.72s - 661.48s |  the demonstrations and solutions.
661.48s - 664.28s |  Showing the defenders vulnerabilities on site
664.28s - 665.76s |  is immensely fun
665.76s - 668.00s |  and can have an extremely positive impact.
668.96s - 673.96s |  Talking somebody through how you can bypass a door
675.44s - 677.88s |  versus showing them how to do it
677.88s - 680.32s |  have huge differences in the likelihood
680.32s - 684.72s |  that an issue will be mitigated or a solution implemented.
684.76s - 688.84s |  These steps in the process
688.84s - 691.48s |  also get the most heads popping into the room.
692.44s - 693.68s |  People get really excited
693.68s - 696.48s |  when you show them how to do an under door slip
696.48s - 701.48s |  or use an under door tool or a latch slit.
704.96s - 707.04s |  Avoid fear, uncertainty and doubt.
707.04s - 711.20s |  This one's probably the most critical in my opinion.
711.20s - 714.64s |  You wanna avoid letting people know that things are bad.
714.64s - 715.96s |  You wanna make sure that
716.60s - 718.08s |  even if something is really bad,
718.08s - 721.88s |  good news, I'm here, I found this thing,
721.88s - 723.60s |  now we can tackle it together
723.60s - 725.28s |  and it won't be a problem anymore.
728.38s - 729.62s |  How to educate clients
729.62s - 732.54s |  and provide a means for clients to contact you.
732.54s - 735.14s |  You wanna make sure that after you've done your test
735.14s - 737.18s |  and you've written your report,
737.18s - 738.82s |  you wanna provide contacts
739.66s - 743.38s |  that are officially your work contacts
743.38s - 745.14s |  for people to reach out to you
745.14s - 746.86s |  and ask you follow up questions.
746.90s - 749.70s |  They're going to happen, nobody knows everything
749.70s - 751.54s |  and even professionals might forget
751.54s - 753.50s |  to provide some key information.
753.50s - 757.42s |  Giving them a company email or a company phone number
757.42s - 758.90s |  and requesting that they reach out to you
758.90s - 761.78s |  during company time is really important
761.78s - 763.10s |  because then they can reach out
763.10s - 766.30s |  if they have some sort of immediate concern
766.30s - 770.22s |  or just if they want you to return later.
770.22s - 772.34s |  That point of contact is pretty critical.
773.98s - 776.66s |  Now, this is something that might be important
777.46s - 780.22s |  to all of you, how can you get into physical security?
780.22s - 782.90s |  I'm gonna talk about some podcasts, YouTube channels
782.90s - 785.38s |  and Udemy access options
785.38s - 787.26s |  for you to get into physical security.
788.30s - 791.26s |  And I'm old, so I'm gonna hold this very close to my face.
792.90s - 795.42s |  I feel education is the most important aspect
795.42s - 796.90s |  in hacking and security.
796.90s - 798.54s |  That's not to say that a four-year degree
798.54s - 801.06s |  or anything like that is necessary.
801.06s - 803.58s |  The different approaches to learning are varied
803.58s - 806.54s |  and there are a few podcasts, YouTube and Udemy
807.42s - 809.38s |  that were big wins for me personally.
809.38s - 811.26s |  If you want to get into lockpicking
811.26s - 814.74s |  or just see some jaw-dropping feats of lock exploits,
814.74s - 817.22s |  then look no further than Lockpicking Lawyer.
817.22s - 820.58s |  The content of his channel is consistently enjoyable
820.58s - 822.54s |  and never stale or boring.
822.54s - 826.18s |  If you are an auditory learner, then podcasts are fantastic.
826.18s - 829.34s |  Darknet Diaries is amazing with great storytelling
829.34s - 832.42s |  and incredible guests and lessons learned are valuable
832.42s - 835.18s |  and always come in an entertaining package.
835.18s - 838.22s |  If you want direct attention towards certification,
838.22s - 840.74s |  I think Mike Myers does a great job on Udemy
840.74s - 844.18s |  and anything and everything by the Exam Cram Book Company
844.18s - 848.18s |  I think is fantastic.
848.18s - 851.50s |  Simply learning how to do physical security from books
851.50s - 854.30s |  isn't necessarily for everybody, but it worked for me
854.30s - 857.98s |  because I could revisit individual concepts very quickly.
857.98s - 859.66s |  Dale Carnegie has a book called
859.66s - 862.18s |  How to Win Friends and Influence People
862.18s - 864.98s |  if you wanna do physical on-site pen testing
865.02s - 867.86s |  where you're not going to be announcing your presence.
867.86s - 870.42s |  Practical Lockpicking by Deviant Olaf
870.42s - 872.50s |  is a fantastic technical read
872.50s - 874.90s |  on physical security and lockpicking.
874.90s - 877.42s |  The Art of Deception by Kevin Mitnick.
877.42s - 881.18s |  It's a little flourishy, but the content is really good.
882.42s - 884.78s |  What Everybody is Saying by Joe Navarro
884.78s - 886.82s |  will help you with body language.
886.82s - 889.26s |  And again, I just wanna call out Exam Cram.
889.26s - 892.86s |  They're really good and they give you extra tests
892.86s - 900.32s |  and they give you flashcards.
900.32s - 901.72s |  You got the slides?
901.72s - 903.00s |  Just in time, Ian.
904.36s - 907.04s |  So these are three people who helped me a lot
907.04s - 908.80s |  as I was getting started.
908.80s - 911.52s |  If you find somebody on YouTube or at a con
911.52s - 913.72s |  that speaks to you personally,
913.72s - 915.76s |  the language they're using sounds good,
915.76s - 918.40s |  the ethos sound good, you just vibe with it,
918.40s - 920.52s |  reach out to them, send them an email,
920.52s - 922.72s |  throw them some information on Twitter.
922.72s - 923.56s |  I brought cards.
923.56s - 925.20s |  If what I'm saying sounds interesting,
925.24s - 927.52s |  please walk up to me and I will give you some.
928.68s - 931.76s |  Deviant, Ian, and Jason helped me a ton.
931.76s - 932.64s |  He's right here.
932.64s - 933.96s |  Wave at him, embarrass him.
935.96s - 938.28s |  Definitely reach out to the people
938.28s - 939.76s |  that you find interesting.
939.76s - 942.96s |  We as hackers enjoy telling stories.
942.96s - 946.40s |  So we're not going to be annoyed by you, I promise.
949.82s - 951.78s |  Take Guided Courses.
951.78s - 954.78s |  Taking guided courses are expensive,
954.78s - 956.38s |  but being able to raise your hand
956.78s - 958.82s |  and say, I don't understand the thing
958.82s - 961.42s |  is a really, really, really big deal.
961.42s - 964.22s |  And being right in front of the person
964.22s - 966.30s |  or on the other end of a video call
966.30s - 971.38s |  makes that exchange very quick and very efficient.
971.38s - 973.18s |  Attend local meetings.
973.18s - 975.90s |  If you've got a DEF CON group meet up near you,
975.90s - 977.98s |  please go, please meet people.
977.98s - 979.46s |  It might be the opportunity
979.46s - 981.58s |  that you need to get the job that you want
981.58s - 983.90s |  or just give you the person that you need to talk to
983.90s - 986.46s |  to learn how to do the thing that you're trying to do.
986.54s - 991.53s |  Um, oh no, laptop.
992.45s - 995.85s |  Okay, how to learn physical security.
995.85s - 998.81s |  Other than just taking courses, reading books,
998.81s - 1000.41s |  go to a local tool meetup
1000.41s - 1004.17s |  or go to LPV right here at DEF CON.
1004.17s - 1006.25s |  Try to pick locks, have fun.
1006.25s - 1008.69s |  No one's going to judge you if you don't know how to.
1008.69s - 1010.57s |  Those are the best people.
1010.57s - 1012.57s |  And we'll be able to give you
1012.57s - 1014.77s |  the proper techniques off the bat.
1014.77s - 1017.41s |  So you don't have to worry about spending hours
1017.41s - 1019.13s |  or days doing it the wrong way.
1020.57s - 1022.21s |  I just want to say a special thanks
1022.21s - 1023.97s |  to my friends and family,
1023.97s - 1026.33s |  all the Orlando hackers that have helped me out.
1026.33s - 1027.17s |  Hi.
1028.57s - 1029.57s |  Thank you all.
1029.57s - 1030.65s |  Hack all the things.
1030.65s - 1033.57s |  If you have any questions, please talk to me.
1033.57s - 1035.05s |  Here's me.
1035.05s - 1036.93s |  There's my email address,
1036.93s - 1039.53s |  my Twitter and my LinkedIn.
1039.53s - 1040.61s |  Take a picture.
1040.61s - 1041.77s |  I don't mind pictures.
1041.77s - 1043.73s |  I can't see all of you because of the lights,
1043.73s - 1045.85s |  but hi everybody, hi.
1047.41s - 1049.05s |  Please reach out to me if you have questions
1049.05s - 1051.21s |  about physical security or breaking into buildings
1051.21s - 1053.09s |  or you just want some stories.
1053.09s - 1054.13s |  I'm the magician.
1054.13s - 1057.62s |  I hope you have a fun time at DEF CON.
