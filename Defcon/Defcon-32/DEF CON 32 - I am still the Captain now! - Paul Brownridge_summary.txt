- **Manual Processes**: Essential for restarting systems post-blackout
- **System Complexity**: Diverse and outdated systems complicate cybersecurity efforts

**Testing and Vulnerabilities**
- **Integrated Control and Monitoring System (ICMS)**: High-value target for attackers
- **ECDIS**: Critical for navigation; redundancy with physical maps
- **Safety Management**: Integral for emergency response and ship coordination

**Attack Surface Exploration**
- **IP to Serial Connections**: Used for older systems
- **Modbus Protocol**: Potential vulnerability for injecting values into PLCs
- **TeamViewer**: Found on systems, illustrating outdated and risky practices

**Conclusion**
- **Possibility of Hacks**: Requires significant time and insider knowledge
- **Social Engineering**: A viable threat vector
- **Modernization Risks**: New technologies introduce new vulnerabilities
- **Undocumented Systems**: Frequent in maritime environments, complicating security efforts

**Final Thoughts**
- Ships can be hacked, but it involves complex, manual processes and deep system knowledge
- Emphasis on the need for understanding ship architecture and cautious modernization
