  "description": "There are physical markings that are required under hundreds of different international laws, some governing transport of goods across national borders, some offering humanitarian protections on the battlefield, some seeking to protect the environment or genetic diversity\u2026 What they all have in common is that they\u2019re currently represented by visual marks applied to objects. Many of these processes are undergoing \u201cdigitalization,\u201d and becoming machine-readable, or electronically-signaled. A standards effort currently underway in the IETF seeks to create a common global marking protocol which would allow open-standards-based devices to scan, cryptographically validate, and display the digital versions of these marks. This session will relate the state of the standards effort, the scope of markings that have been considered thus far, and seek input on security or privacy vulnerabilities which may exist in the proposed standard.",

 I'm going to be talking today about digital emblems and that is kind of a neologism.
7.11s - 12.03s |  So, I'll take a little bit of explaining what they are and why this is interesting
12.03s - 13.45s |  from a technical point of view.
14.41s - 17.71s |  This is basically reporting out of work that is happening
18.29s - 21.95s |  in the Internet Engineering Task Force that's building on top
21.95s - 26.41s |  of existing protocols, DNS, DNSSEC, and DAIN.
27.31s - 32.11s |  So, let's get started.
32.91s - 39.43s |  The idea behind digital emblems is that they will supplement or eventually maybe replace the
39.43s - 43.91s |  physical markings that are required on things under international law.
44.59s - 47.75s |  So, let's take a look at some examples of what those physical markings are.
48.43s - 54.87s |  Going sort of, you know, clockwise from the top right, see a press photographer
55.25s - 61.57s |  with the press marking, the thing with the orange background is ISO container marking,
61.65s - 65.55s |  which every ISO container out there has one of those on it, serial number,
65.55s - 67.99s |  and a lot of standardized information.
68.89s - 74.95s |  You've got some UN blue helmets, they're a marking that's recognized
74.95s - 81.25s |  under international Geneva Conventions specifically for peacekeepers.
81.37s - 87.07s |  The thing under that is four different chemical weapons components,
87.23s - 89.79s |  chemicals that are being shipped in a cardboard box.
90.47s - 94.93s |  Under that, there is the end of a wooden pallet.
95.23s - 99.31s |  Every piece of wood that crosses an international border has to be marked
99.87s - 105.37s |  to show how it's been freed of termites and stuff.
105.37s - 111.03s |  Next to that, there's a blue and white shield of UNESCO for a World Heritage Site
111.03s - 113.67s |  or World Heritage Artwork.
114.17s - 119.57s |  Next to that, every piece of radioactive material, every piece of radioactive fuel or waste
119.57s - 121.77s |  that crosses an international border has to be marked.
122.59s - 125.23s |  And then the orange bag there is a diplomatic pouch.
126.09s - 131.03s |  The Vienna Convention of 1961 on Diplomatic Relations says all
131.03s - 134.01s |  about how diplomatic pouches have to be handled.
134.01s - 137.17s |  They can't be delayed or inspected.
137.23s - 142.41s |  So, let's take a look at one of those in a little more detail.
142.41s - 149.73s |  This is the phytosanitary marking, the one that goes onto wood crates and pallets.
150.41s - 154.71s |  So, this is administered by the Food and Agriculture Organization.
154.71s - 158.63s |  That is an intergovernmental organization that is responsible
158.63s - 162.11s |  for the International Plant Protection Convention.
162.11s - 166.27s |  That is the body of law that requires this marking.
166.99s - 173.33s |  And then specifically, there's a particular law, the International Standard
173.33s - 177.43s |  for Phytosanitary Measures Number 15 requires this marking.
177.89s - 181.53s |  So, within that marking, you've got a country code, region code,
181.89s - 188.79s |  the treatment service provider license number, the person who did the treatment of the crate
188.79s - 195.63s |  or whatever, how the treatment was done, and then you've got some sort of serialization.
195.91s - 200.51s |  So, a thing to notice about this is this is a hot metal brand shoved
200.51s - 204.07s |  into a piece of wood with variable data on it.
205.33s - 207.87s |  Right? Hot metal brand, variable data.
208.59s - 209.27s |  We're engineers.
209.27s - 210.89s |  We know how to deal with variable data.
211.23s - 216.01s |  The hot metal brand part seems like it doesn't scale so well, though.
216.01s - 217.93s |  So, what are problems with physical markings?
219.23s - 223.09s |  It's really hard to tell whether a physical marking is being misused.
223.49s - 228.35s |  Did the person who put the physical marking on something, were they authorized to do that?
229.17s - 230.57s |  Does it still apply?
231.37s - 233.99s |  Was it marked and got scraped off?
233.99s - 236.51s |  Right? There are lots and lots of issues with physical markings.
237.01s - 243.89s |  But beyond that, typically they're not, they're meant to be human readable,
243.89s - 246.15s |  but they're not optimized for machine readability.
246.89s - 250.39s |  And then you can't actually apply them to something that's not physical.
250.39s - 257.47s |  So, digital data, you can't apply a physical mark to digital data and expect it to be readable.
257.89s - 261.59s |  You can apply it to the thing that holds the data, but not to the data itself.
261.99s - 267.03s |  And if, for instance, an attacker is coming in over the network,
267.41s - 269.75s |  they can't see the physical thing that they're attacking.
269.75s - 273.91s |  So, they can't see whether something, some mark's been stenciled on it.
275.35s - 277.59s |  And electronic services, right?
277.75s - 283.07s |  Not just data at rest or data in flight, but like an email server.
283.39s - 288.03s |  How would you mark that an email server was protected or licensed or whatever, right?
291.23s - 296.79s |  So, beyond that, when we start to get into cryptographic authentication,
297.11s - 303.31s |  we get this whole suite of additional capabilities around revocation and, you know,
303.35s - 309.99s |  things timing out and signature roles and all these kinds of things that we kind of take for granted
310.95s - 314.91s |  in cryptography, which, you know, people who do physical markings, you know,
314.91s - 319.75s |  they got a stencil and a rattle can and, you know, they don't have any of those tools.
320.31s - 322.95s |  So, how do we move forward?
322.99s - 325.59s |  What can we mark with digital emblem?
326.15s - 332.27s |  Right now, it's defined as people, places, things, data at rest, data in flight, and online services.
333.35s - 337.83s |  And, you know, throughout the rest of this talk and in the standards documents and so forth,
337.83s - 340.75s |  we just refer to all of that collectively as assets.
342.03s - 346.27s |  Because we're not trying to differentiate them in any way, right?
346.27s - 348.75s |  We want a standard that works with all of them.
351.59s - 356.39s |  There are a couple of non-goals, things that come up in conversation a lot with people
356.39s - 358.71s |  who are first looking at this problem space.
359.03s - 364.91s |  So, people look at the protective emblems, particularly like that UNESCO emblem
365.27s - 369.47s |  that gets put on, for instance, a church in Ukraine, right?
370.59s - 372.75s |  And then the Russians come along and blow up the church.
373.15s - 376.71s |  And people say, well, that emblem didn't protect the church.
377.43s - 382.51s |  Just like if we put a digital emblem on a website, and somebody DDoS's the website.
383.39s - 385.75s |  Okay, it didn't protect the website.
386.23s - 389.59s |  But neither would a physical marking, right?
389.59s - 396.03s |  The physical marking or the digital marking, what it's doing is it's making the job
396.03s - 398.87s |  of a lawyer in the Hague easier, right?
398.87s - 404.27s |  If they want to prosecute somebody for a war crime, showing that the person was duly informed
404.27s - 408.03s |  that what they were doing was or about to do was a war crime before they did it
408.31s - 413.19s |  and did it knowingly and maliciously, right, that makes their job as a lawyer easier.
413.83s - 421.95s |  And then, you know, all the sort of just compliance markings, this is about ease of use, right?
421.95s - 425.11s |  It's about making the job of a customs inspector easier.
425.51s - 429.19s |  It's not going to do any magic, you know,
429.19s - 431.71s |  it's not going to do anything really differently than the physical marking.
431.95s - 433.47s |  It's just easier.
434.31s - 441.23s |  And then the other thing is a lot of people think, well, if you do this digital emblem
441.27s - 446.99s |  and you embody it in a QR code, somebody could just copy that QR code from one crate
447.23s - 451.19s |  to another crate and, oh, we've hacked the system, right?
451.55s - 453.59s |  But that's not how it works.
453.59s - 459.31s |  This is like saying if I copy the URL of a website onto another thing that I've hacked
459.31s - 462.63s |  the website, no, the website is still out there in the Internet.
463.11s - 465.31s |  The digital emblem is still out there in the Internet.
465.87s - 473.51s |  What's marked on the crate or the building or somebody's ID card is essentially just like a URL, right?
473.51s - 479.31s |  It's a label that the validator is going to go and check.
481.35s - 487.19s |  So the trick is not physically attaching it to the thing.
487.19s - 489.55s |  The trick is associating it with the thing.
489.55s - 494.23s |  So when somebody looks at it, they'll understand that, yes, this is the right thing.
495.51s - 498.15s |  So let's take a look at that a little bit more closely.
498.75s - 502.51s |  We've got an issuer, somebody who is creating digital emblems,
504.47s - 510.11s |  and they create a bundle of records that are the digital emblem, and then they sign it.
512.51s - 516.51s |  That gets attached to an asset through a description.
516.55s - 521.35s |  The description says, you know, this digital emblem applies to this person.
521.35s - 523.31s |  This digital emblem applies to this crate.
523.35s - 526.75s |  This digital emblem applies to this building or this vehicle.
529.03s - 541.39s |  And that description is going to be a serial number or a height or mass or location or time and place.
543.11s - 547.39s |  So a validator, somebody who wants to figure out whether this thing is legit,
547.87s - 555.19s |  is going to evaluate first the signature to make sure that the issuer is a legitimate issuer, right,
555.19s - 557.75s |  is who they're expecting.
558.99s - 565.15s |  And they're going to check the description to make sure that the asset is the thing described by the emblem.
567.33s - 568.93s |  So who are validators?
572.55s - 575.47s |  A lot of people really focus on the military uses.
575.47s - 578.75s |  So you can have a loitering munition that's sitting around up there,
579.07s - 585.19s |  and it's nighttime and you've got a convoy and, you know, one truck has the medical supplies.
585.67s - 589.35s |  And so that one is the one that's protected under the Geneva Conventions.
589.35s - 590.91s |  The other ones have ammunition.
590.91s - 592.07s |  They are not protected.
592.43s - 595.67s |  The loitering munition has to make a decision between these.
595.87s - 600.87s |  If it can make a decision based on something machine readable and cryptographically authenticatable,
601.15s - 605.15s |  it's going to make a much better decision than if it's up there in the dark trying to figure out
605.15s - 610.43s |  whether there's a marking on the side of a truck that it's looking at the top of, right?
611.67s - 616.03s |  But by and large, this is going to get used by customs agents, right?
616.03s - 623.19s |  99 times out of 100, it's going to be somebody scanning a cargo container or, you know, a crate or whatever.
624.99s - 628.11s |  So what problem is this mostly solving?
629.79s - 633.91s |  Proliferation of proprietary scanners.
634.39s - 640.27s |  So what's happening right now is these markings already exist and a lot more besides that.
640.91s - 644.35s |  And people are trying to digitize them.
644.39s - 649.59s |  People are trying to take these physical markings and create some digital workflow around them.
649.99s - 654.59s |  And so, you know, they come up with something and maybe it's kind of a hack
654.95s - 660.91s |  and it involves a scanner that some that a validator can use to point at the box or whatever
660.91s - 666.11s |  and, you know, press the button and look at the screen on the back and it says, yes, this is OK.
666.51s - 671.15s |  Or no, this is counterfeit goods or no, this has been tampered with or whatever.
672.59s - 675.95s |  So the problem is that customs agents are starting to get
676.23s - 679.27s |  more and more of these proprietary scanners stacking up.
679.27s - 683.11s |  So a shipment comes in, they have to go to the closet, rummage around,
683.11s - 688.23s |  figure out what the right scanner is, whether the battery is charged and then go scan the thing.
688.63s - 692.03s |  And this is just the tip of the iceberg, right?
692.03s - 695.35s |  This is just the first few organizations that have started to do this.
695.71s - 700.71s |  And, you know, these organizations are not happy about having to develop this themselves.
700.71s - 705.31s |  So you've got folks like Apple, folks like Cisco, folks like Nokia,
705.83s - 709.99s |  who are really concerned about counterfeit goods.
710.51s - 713.03s |  And they've got international law on their side.
713.03s - 716.83s |  WIPO administers, I think, 38 different international laws,
717.31s - 720.11s |  several of which are about counterfeiting.
721.79s - 727.63s |  So, you know, they can work with customs agents to identify
728.03s - 732.23s |  legitimate versus counterfeit goods, but their systems,
732.79s - 735.19s |  like each of those each of those companies I just mentioned,
735.19s - 737.51s |  each one has a completely different system for doing it.
737.51s - 740.11s |  Different physical scanner, different software, different everything.
740.63s - 743.51s |  So this is the main thing we're trying to solve, right?
743.51s - 746.59s |  We're trying to get an open standard that can be implemented
746.59s - 750.59s |  in open source software on open hardware cheaply.
751.23s - 753.87s |  Everybody can just make do with a single scanner
753.87s - 756.91s |  that will scan all of these different kinds of things.
758.11s - 761.47s |  So what's a digital emblem look like?
762.07s - 765.43s |  We've got in the top left there, the issuer,
766.95s - 770.07s |  bottom left, the asset, the validator over on the right.
771.03s - 776.07s |  The digital emblem is the set of records there that are in that green box.
776.67s - 782.87s |  And that's the binding first issuer to emblem and then emblem to asset.
782.87s - 786.07s |  So and this is just some examples, right?
786.07s - 789.63s |  There are actually a whole lot more different, very specific bindings
789.63s - 790.35s |  that are available.
790.35s - 793.91s |  So we've got a visual representation of the emblem, right?
794.23s - 797.35s |  If it's a diplomatic pouch from Cote d'Ivoire,
797.63s - 802.79s |  the Cote d'Ivoire national seal is going to be the visual representation.
803.55s - 806.19s |  We've got an identification of law.
806.19s - 807.75s |  Again, if it's a diplomatic pouch,
807.75s - 811.71s |  it's going to be the Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations, 1961.
812.03s - 813.63s |  We've got the contact information.
813.63s - 817.83s |  In this case, it would be the contact information of the logistics person
817.83s - 821.11s |  in the foreign ministry of Cote d'Ivoire,
821.11s - 823.99s |  who's responsible for administering their diplomatic shipments.
824.63s - 825.99s |  We've got handling flags.
825.99s - 828.11s |  Is there anything fragile here?
828.11s - 831.83s |  Does it need to be in the pressurized compartment of the airplane hold?
832.87s - 834.91s |  What should we do if,
835.63s - 838.95s |  you know, the handling conditions are violated?
839.79s - 842.43s |  We've got the issuer's cryptographic signature,
842.71s - 844.55s |  and then we've got third party signatures.
844.55s - 847.55s |  These are cross signatures to create a web of trust.
848.23s - 852.15s |  Let's say you're a customs agent and, you know, you get something
852.15s - 855.51s |  that comes in from Cote d'Ivoire foreign ministry.
856.07s - 860.99s |  And, you know, you have no idea whether they're legit or not.
860.99s - 863.07s |  You haven't heard of Cote d'Ivoire before,
863.07s - 865.75s |  but there are five different other signatures on there,
865.75s - 870.19s |  one from Guinea and one from Gambia and one from Niger, right?
870.43s - 873.79s |  All saying, yes, you know, this is this is a real foreign ministry
873.79s - 877.59s |  that we work with and recognize as being a legit country.
877.79s - 881.15s |  Right. So those cross signatures, that web of trust, just like in PGP,
881.35s - 884.03s |  it gives you some assurance that you're dealing with a real entity
884.03s - 889.63s |  and not like a typo squatter or somebody using a homograph in the label name.
891.19s - 895.59s |  So then on the asset, we've got a temporal and a spatial scope of validity.
896.39s - 900.59s |  Is this thing in the place it's supposed to be at the time it's supposed to be?
900.79s - 903.87s |  And so that's probably going to be a series of things, right?
903.91s - 906.99s |  And if it's on an airplane,
907.31s - 912.31s |  that's going to be a series of long, skinny polygons
912.99s - 916.87s |  covering the airplane flight, the projected airplane flight,
917.11s - 920.27s |  and then the airport at the destination
920.27s - 922.91s |  where it's going to be going through customs, for instance.
924.51s - 929.67s |  So that pairing of a bunch of locations and times
930.23s - 935.23s |  gives some idea of of when and where this thing should be accepted.
935.51s - 940.03s |  So to give a different example, let's say that we have a diplomatic envoy
941.03s - 946.15s |  whose mission is in Germany in twenty twenty five.
946.43s - 950.23s |  And yet they show up in Hungary in December of twenty twenty four
950.23s - 951.95s |  and they present their credential.
951.95s - 958.43s |  The you know, the immigration guy in Hungary can evaluate this and say,
958.43s - 962.19s |  OK, that's nice, but you're just a regular guy here, right?
962.51s - 967.71s |  Your diplomatic credential is valid next month in a different country.
968.11s - 970.67s |  Not right here, right now, right here, right now.
970.91s - 973.63s |  You're just coming in on your regular passport.
976.07s - 978.35s |  So then we've got a bunch of stuff,
978.35s - 980.87s |  you know, SI base units of size and weight.
980.95s - 983.75s |  You know, how big is this thing? How heavy is this thing?
985.23s - 988.79s |  And then the World Customs Organization is,
989.35s - 993.83s |  you know, the the international organization of customs agencies.
994.15s - 997.59s |  They've got all this stuff standardized and have for a long time
997.59s - 1003.83s |  for, you know, paperwork, you know, crate number three of a shipment of five.
1003.83s - 1005.75s |  Right. Stuff like that.
1005.75s - 1007.71s |  You know, how many barrels is it?
1009.47s - 1011.71s |  Standardized.
1012.15s - 1015.91s |  Packaging and so forth is all really well standardized already, right?
1015.91s - 1018.19s |  So we don't need to reinvent any of that
1020.43s - 1024.63s |  name, serial numbers, distinguishing marks and then external references.
1025.11s - 1028.95s |  What about a link to a photograph of the thing?
1029.31s - 1031.91s |  So you can look at a picture of it and say,
1032.07s - 1034.47s |  does that look like the thing in front of me? Right.
1034.47s - 1037.71s |  Does this look like the person in front of me? Pretty straightforward.
1038.63s - 1042.23s |  So then we get into the distribution side of this.
1042.59s - 1046.47s |  How do we communicate the digital emblem to the validator?
1046.47s - 1048.91s |  How does the validator find out about this thing?
1049.47s - 1052.31s |  So let's run through those.
1052.67s - 1055.67s |  For data at rest and data in flight.
1057.27s - 1060.75s |  For data at rest, there are kind of three possibilities, right?
1060.75s - 1065.35s |  Either the emblem encapsulates the data.
1065.43s - 1068.75s |  So we have the emblem and the data gets shoved inside the emblem
1069.47s - 1073.51s |  or the emblem and the data are sitting next to each other on some media.
1074.39s - 1079.31s |  Or the emblem gets shoved into the data and is encapsulated within the data.
1079.31s - 1081.39s |  Right. So those are our three possibilities.
1081.39s - 1084.63s |  And, you know, side by side is easy.
1084.63s - 1087.75s |  It's just like two files or whatever.
1087.75s - 1091.07s |  And then we've got different ways of doing encapsulation already.
1091.07s - 1092.79s |  Plenty of standards that we can use there.
1092.79s - 1097.71s |  MIME, which is used for email, is, for instance, a perfectly mature one.
1098.83s - 1101.91s |  For data in flight, this is going to be TLS, right?
1101.91s - 1103.75s |  I'm not a TLS expert.
1103.75s - 1105.03s |  Lots of people are.
1105.03s - 1106.95s |  This is going to be some sort of TLS thing.
1108.39s - 1109.83s |  In band network response.
1109.83s - 1112.23s |  We've already got this. Dane.
1112.23s - 1115.99s |  DNS, DNSSEC, Dane. Issue a certificate. Done.
1118.03s - 1120.87s |  Passive RF responders and active RF responders.
1120.87s - 1124.47s |  Again, RFID. Done. We just take what's already existing.
1125.59s - 1127.19s |  Active RFID beacon.
1127.19s - 1130.51s |  So this is something where you would query it and it would respond.
1130.71s - 1133.51s |  Oh, sorry. Sorry. Beacon.
1133.51s - 1135.07s |  This is like radio station.
1135.07s - 1138.03s |  It's just broadcasting the signal.
1138.31s - 1140.27s |  And you listen and you've got it.
1141.55s - 1144.35s |  So that could be just on some specific frequency
1144.35s - 1149.83s |  that the validator and the issuer both know is supposed to be used for this.
1149.83s - 1152.91s |  Or it could be spread spectrum or whatever. Who knows? Right.
1153.19s - 1156.63s |  This is one of those things that is going to be very specific
1156.63s - 1161.47s |  to the use case and the validator and the issuer for them to work out.
1161.47s - 1165.11s |  It doesn't really have anything to do with the the data model.
1166.11s - 1168.83s |  Passive optical marking.
1169.07s - 1173.59s |  This is the physical marking of the digital marking
1174.27s - 1176.19s |  that replaces the physical marking.
1176.19s - 1178.15s |  So that could be a QR code.
1178.15s - 1180.75s |  Right. Could be letters painted on the side of something.
1181.55s - 1183.83s |  Barcodes. Printed text.
1183.83s - 1187.51s |  It could be like an e-ink screen that displays the data.
1188.87s - 1190.67s |  Whatever. It just needs to be some way.
1190.67s - 1192.71s |  It's like communicating a URL. Right.
1192.71s - 1196.59s |  You just need to be able to get that label across so that the validator can check it.
1198.79s - 1200.99s |  Active optical transponder. Right.
1200.99s - 1205.31s |  This would be hypothetically like you blink the flashlight at them
1205.31s - 1207.71s |  and they blink the flashlight back.
1207.71s - 1212.83s |  Who knows? This is like if you build a matrix, this is a spot in the matrix.
1213.59s - 1216.51s |  I don't know if there's a use case for that or not.
1216.51s - 1217.91s |  Active optical beacon.
1217.91s - 1221.63s |  At first, I was thinking, you know, active optical beacon is going to do that.
1221.91s - 1225.31s |  And then I started talking with aviation folks and they were like, that's the one.
1225.31s - 1227.71s |  That's the important one that we're going to do.
1227.71s - 1231.59s |  So taking the navigation lights on an aircraft,
1231.59s - 1234.99s |  it turns out there's already a standard for modulating data on that.
1236.07s - 1239.91s |  It's a it's an 802.11 standard, just like Ethernet.
1240.27s - 1245.59s |  So you can modulate the data on existing navigation and hazard lights.
1246.43s - 1249.67s |  You could do the same thing on the light bar of an emergency vehicle.
1250.19s - 1255.59s |  Lighthouses, you know, anything where you've got some sort of light,
1255.59s - 1258.47s |  if you can modulate it fast enough, you can put data on it.
1258.83s - 1262.35s |  And that is an active optical beacon, which.
1263.03s - 1267.79s |  OK, cool. Active audio transponder.
1268.71s - 1273.15s |  You that's like Amazon Echo or whatever, you talk to it and it talks back to you.
1273.79s - 1276.15s |  Is there a use case? I don't know.
1276.15s - 1278.03s |  And active audio beacon.
1278.03s - 1281.63s |  So that's kind of like the optical one, right?
1281.63s - 1287.59s |  You could modulate data onto an existing sound source, right?
1287.59s - 1293.99s |  If that's a siren on a fire truck, for instance, you could modulate data onto that.
1294.95s - 1299.35s |  You could do this at audible frequencies or above or below audible frequencies.
1300.79s - 1305.87s |  You could do it steganographed into like background music, right?
1306.15s - 1307.83s |  All kinds of cool tricks you can do with this.
1309.03s - 1313.83s |  So we just run through a couple of interesting use cases that came out of,
1313.83s - 1316.59s |  like all the use case interviews at the beginning of the process.
1316.91s - 1322.87s |  So diplomatic pouches, this is one of the really obvious use cases.
1322.87s - 1327.15s |  And there are obviously a lot of foreign ministries out there shipping stuff around.
1329.07s - 1330.47s |  But let's talk through this.
1330.47s - 1334.35s |  So the law says that you can't delay or inspect it.
1334.75s - 1338.15s |  Right. Customs agent receives the diplomatic pouch.
1338.15s - 1340.67s |  It comes in. It's in with a lot of other stuff.
1341.07s - 1343.31s |  That one, they can't delay.
1343.51s - 1346.75s |  It can't sit around there and they can't inspect it.
1346.95s - 1350.23s |  They can look at the outside of it, but they can't open it up
1350.87s - 1353.59s |  and they can't weigh it and they can't X-ray it.
1354.43s - 1355.51s |  They're only allowed to look.
1356.63s - 1358.75s |  Passive optical inspection of the outside.
1358.95s - 1364.31s |  All right. So the problem here is that people smuggling contraband
1364.67s - 1368.83s |  know this and can mark their crate diplomatic pouch,
1368.83s - 1370.79s |  and that makes it illegal to inspect.
1370.79s - 1372.79s |  And yet they are smuggling contraband.
1373.75s - 1376.75s |  And they're not authorized by anybody due to that.
1376.75s - 1378.47s |  That is inherently illegal.
1378.47s - 1380.87s |  So the customs agent is in this dilemma.
1380.95s - 1381.79s |  What do they do?
1381.79s - 1387.11s |  They've got something marked diplomatic pouch, and yet it could contain contraband.
1387.35s - 1391.71s |  So if they can scan something on that and cryptographically verify
1391.71s - 1395.27s |  that it was shipped by the foreign ministry of Japan,
1395.91s - 1397.79s |  it can be entirely full of cocaine.
1397.79s - 1399.51s |  And it's not their problem.
1399.51s - 1401.31s |  It's the foreign ministry of Japan's problem
1401.31s - 1404.07s |  because it was under their authorization that it was shipped.
1404.43s - 1406.23s |  And we haven't inspected it.
1406.23s - 1408.27s |  We haven't looked inside. We haven't weighed it.
1408.27s - 1409.95s |  We have no idea whether it's cocaine or not.
1409.95s - 1412.27s |  Doesn't matter. Not our problem.
1412.27s - 1416.47s |  On the other hand, we scan it and we get an invalid scan.
1416.95s - 1418.43s |  Right. Doesn't validate.
1418.43s - 1421.11s |  We can go to town on it, open it up, whatever,
1421.39s - 1424.07s |  because it's not actually a diplomatic pouch at that point.
1424.47s - 1426.07s |  That was a false marking.
1426.07s - 1428.07s |  So we can't do that with physical marking.
1428.07s - 1429.67s |  There's just no way to tell.
1429.67s - 1432.19s |  We have to depend on all these other things, right?
1432.43s - 1435.35s |  We have to get on the phone with the foreign ministry of Japan
1435.67s - 1439.15s |  logistics people and hope that they also speak Swahili, right?
1440.11s - 1440.99s |  Good luck.
1441.79s - 1444.11s |  OK, so UNESCO.
1444.11s - 1447.79s |  This was a really interesting one because we'd done all of these interviews
1447.79s - 1450.35s |  with folks who wanted to attach a label to a thing.
1451.35s - 1454.39s |  We get to UNESCO and they're like, yeah, we've got all these artworks
1454.39s - 1459.55s |  to get shipped around between countries to, you know, exhibitions and stuff.
1459.55s - 1463.07s |  And then we've got these buildings and we've got whole neighborhoods
1463.07s - 1464.51s |  and so forth and neighborhoods.
1464.51s - 1465.23s |  It's no big deal, right?
1465.23s - 1468.59s |  Because you're just defining a polygon, right?
1468.59s - 1470.67s |  Just like that airplane flight, right?
1470.67s - 1473.03s |  We're defining a polygon and saying, yes, it's here now.
1473.03s - 1476.43s |  It's been here and it will continue to be here in the future, we hope. Right.
1477.43s - 1479.27s |  That's no problem.
1479.27s - 1482.59s |  But the artworks, it turns out that like a double digit percentage
1482.59s - 1486.59s |  of the artworks that are protected are in an unknown location
1486.71s - 1490.87s |  because they got stolen out of a museum that the
1491.87s - 1496.11s |  Mexican National Archaeology Museum in Mexico City
1496.11s - 1499.55s |  that got knocked over in like ninety six, ninety eight back then,
1499.55s - 1502.31s |  sometime a whole lot of that stuff still out in the wind.
1503.27s - 1505.87s |  There's the Iraqi National Cultural Museum,
1506.27s - 1509.43s |  thousands and thousands of pieces out there that were protected
1509.43s - 1511.91s |  or, you know, out there somewhere.
1512.23s - 1516.95s |  And so we need some way that a.
1518.23s - 1520.83s |  Law enforcement officer that a
1523.87s - 1527.79s |  auction house can check to see whether a thing
1528.15s - 1531.79s |  that came out of somebody's attic is actually a protected
1531.79s - 1533.99s |  cultural artifact that was stolen.
1534.63s - 1537.99s |  And so what we need is a digital emblem
1538.23s - 1541.99s |  that has a ton of external references to all the sort of known photographs
1541.99s - 1545.59s |  and data about that thing so that somebody who gets a hold of it
1545.59s - 1549.91s |  can be reasonably expected to reassociate it with the emblem.
1550.15s - 1553.15s |  So we've got a bunch of handling flags in there about like,
1553.15s - 1555.35s |  is the location of the object known?
1555.35s - 1556.75s |  Is the location of the emblem known?
1556.75s - 1558.27s |  Are they in the same place? All that.
1559.83s - 1563.23s |  Press press is interesting because we've we've talked about all these ones
1563.23s - 1567.71s |  where there's some authority that is associated with the body of law
1568.03s - 1571.71s |  or an authority that's allowed to ship something or whatever. Right.
1572.11s - 1574.31s |  But who are press people?
1574.31s - 1577.83s |  A press person is a person who's doing journalism
1578.35s - 1580.19s |  and is a noncombatant.
1580.19s - 1582.27s |  That's the definition of a press person.
1582.27s - 1583.83s |  If they're a combatant,
1583.83s - 1587.55s |  they no longer have the protections that a civilian would.
1589.15s - 1592.75s |  They may be doing journalism as a job, but now they're a combatant,
1592.79s - 1594.79s |  so they're not protected.
1595.43s - 1599.59s |  But fundamentally, there's no central agency that says you're a journalist
1599.59s - 1600.55s |  and you're not.
1600.55s - 1605.71s |  So there's nobody that can say, you know, we're the authentic source of this.
1605.71s - 1610.19s |  So we need a solution that journalists could do for themselves
1610.19s - 1615.19s |  or INSEE or CPJ could do on behalf of
1616.03s - 1618.95s |  journalists who are in dangerous situations.
1619.79s - 1625.59s |  CITES, so CITES is the the treaty organization
1625.59s - 1629.43s |  that oversees the body of law around endangered species.
1629.43s - 1633.19s |  So plants and animals that are globally recognized as endangered
1633.71s - 1637.19s |  all have to be shipped with all these markings any time they cross
1637.19s - 1639.11s |  national borders.
1639.59s - 1641.83s |  But if you've got an animal,
1642.19s - 1645.87s |  it's really important that the handling be done properly. Right.
1645.91s - 1649.87s |  So we've got to be able to communicate that in a fairly detailed way.
1650.11s - 1653.47s |  And it's really important that the communications channel back work
1653.79s - 1657.15s |  in case like the animal gets sick or whatever. Right.
1657.39s - 1658.39s |  Same thing's true of plants.
1658.39s - 1661.67s |  Of course, it's just a little bit less obvious.
1661.67s - 1665.07s |  And then aviation, aviation is interesting, a little bit like press, right?
1665.39s - 1669.83s |  You've got this no dual use thing where as long as there's no military
1669.83s - 1673.71s |  use of the aircraft, it's not carrying munitions.
1673.75s - 1676.91s |  It's not carrying troops, anything like that.
1677.19s - 1679.31s |  It's protected as a civilian thing.
1679.31s - 1683.71s |  And there's additional bodies of law under ICAO that that give it
1683.71s - 1686.71s |  additional protections beyond just what a regular civilian would have.
1688.23s - 1690.35s |  So we've got this question of
1690.79s - 1694.71s |  whether there's any military use of that aircraft.
1695.79s - 1697.79s |  But then there's also this interesting thing going on.
1699.59s - 1701.63s |  Like if you talk with Airbus folks,
1702.63s - 1706.23s |  they're starting to build RFID scanners into every opening
1706.23s - 1712.19s |  in the hull of an aircraft so that they can automatically create
1712.19s - 1717.11s |  a manifest of everything that's RFID tag that's going in and out of the aircraft.
1717.67s - 1723.07s |  Now, their idea of why this is important largely has to do with spare parts.
1723.11s - 1727.83s |  Right. So they've got these expert systems and reporting and so forth
1727.83s - 1730.51s |  on the aircraft about failures.
1730.87s - 1734.87s |  And the expert systems predict what spare parts are going to be necessary
1734.87s - 1735.99s |  to repair that failure.
1735.99s - 1741.95s |  So they're starting to do this manifest radio ahead thing where there's,
1742.43s - 1747.27s |  you know, can be relayed on to the airport that they're going to land at.
1747.75s - 1751.31s |  What parts the expert system thinks are going to be needed to turn
1751.31s - 1755.43s |  the aircraft around and get it in the air again so that the logistics
1755.43s - 1759.27s |  supply chain can get those parts to the gate with somebody qualified
1759.27s - 1762.27s |  to install them before the plane even lands.
1762.27s - 1765.23s |  Right. So they're minimizing the downtime of the aircraft.
1767.79s - 1771.23s |  But the thing is, if we've already scanned all these digital emblems
1771.23s - 1775.19s |  that are in the hold, you know, people coming in as passengers and so forth,
1775.19s - 1778.31s |  we can include that in that radio ahead manifest,
1778.55s - 1781.79s |  and that can get split out to customs and immigration
1781.79s - 1784.55s |  so that they know what the exception cases that are going to be coming
1784.99s - 1788.78s |  into them off that aircraft are.
1788.78s - 1790.02s |  So that was it.
1791.46s - 1794.30s |  Plenty of time for questions, if you guys want.
1794.42s - 1797.98s |  Got about 10 minutes again.
1797.98s - 1801.18s |  It's this is a standards efforts happening in the ITF.
1803.30s - 1806.26s |  Hypothetically, you could implement this a bunch of different ways.
1806.26s - 1807.94s |  You can invent new stuff.
1807.94s - 1812.98s |  But all the actual implementers at this point are doing it on top of DNS.
1813.02s - 1816.70s |  So DNS, DNSSEC for the cryptographic signatures,
1817.02s - 1820.78s |  DANE for the certificates, and then DE on top of that,
1820.78s - 1823.82s |  using existing record types almost exclusively.
1825.82s - 1829.10s |  So if anybody has questions, come up to the front mic.
1833.74s - 1846.94s |  QR codes and barcodes have like, you know.
1847.50s - 1849.06s |  Hey, hang on just a sec.
1849.06s - 1853.39s |  Can you guys hear him or is that mic on?
1853.39s - 1855.11s |  Yeah. OK.
1855.11s - 1857.83s |  Can you be loud because I'm I'm having a hard time.
1858.67s - 1860.63s |  QR codes and barcodes have been done.
1860.67s - 1863.35s |  Enough redundancy so they can play games with them.
1863.35s - 1866.15s |  And you can, for instance, put, you know, readable,
1866.15s - 1869.99s |  human readable text and pictures in them.
1870.43s - 1873.91s |  And so it looks like it could be a nice way of,
1874.99s - 1878.07s |  you know, putting labels that are both computer readable and
1879.27s - 1882.11s |  readable to a human in the field.
1882.11s - 1884.87s |  Has has that been discussed in this context?
1885.31s - 1890.59s |  So the there are essentially two ways that the digital emblem can get delivered.
1890.91s - 1893.83s |  The main way is sort of like a website would be
1894.23s - 1896.71s |  you're you're sort of reading the URL, the label.
1896.71s - 1899.39s |  In this case, it's going to be a DNS label.
1899.39s - 1903.27s |  And then you go do a lookup and you get the data and you evaluate the data.
1904.11s - 1907.39s |  So you know where to get that data based on the label
1907.83s - 1910.35s |  and you know what format to expect that data in.
1910.59s - 1913.47s |  So that per se is not really going to be the issue, right?
1913.47s - 1916.99s |  If you enter the right label, like if you have to retype it,
1917.79s - 1920.35s |  you better not mistype. Sure.
1921.43s - 1925.75s |  But the odds are, if you mistype, you're not going to get any sort of result.
1925.87s - 1928.63s |  Right. You're not going to I mean, you get an error. Right.
1930.43s - 1936.31s |  So with a QR code or a barcode or something or an RFID,
1938.31s - 1942.11s |  there's more of a potential for you scan something.
1942.11s - 1946.95s |  But the human being doesn't really know what it is that they've just scanned.
1947.23s - 1951.99s |  So, you know, somebody could affix a fake label over the real one
1951.99s - 1955.47s |  or replace it or whatever and misdirect them to the wrong place.
1955.47s - 1959.23s |  So that's where you start to get the need for the bindings.
1959.31s - 1962.59s |  Right. The validator is an expert, right?
1962.59s - 1963.63s |  They're a customs agent.
1963.63s - 1965.63s |  They're trained to evaluate this stuff.
1966.27s - 1968.83s |  Now you're just passing them more information.
1969.51s - 1973.07s |  And with the higher expectation
1973.07s - 1976.19s |  of of bandwidth there of more information,
1977.47s - 1981.39s |  it's going to give them more tools to do that evaluation. Right.
1981.71s - 1986.91s |  Whether the whether this is real or fake,
1987.31s - 1990.23s |  there's a higher bandwidth channel for them to work with.
1990.79s - 1994.19s |  So, you know, could you game it?
1994.19s - 1997.03s |  Probably. They're always clever hackers.
1997.03s - 2000.11s |  But building on top of a lot of existing work
2000.47s - 2003.03s |  that's already really well tested.
2004.03s - 2007.47s |  You know, we're doing sort of the minimal new work possible.
2008.39s - 2011.59s |  So you mentioned various encodings like MIME and such.
2011.59s - 2016.35s |  It makes me think of X509 and the richness of metadata
2016.35s - 2019.87s |  that can be represented in X509 for certificates.
2020.63s - 2025.87s |  Do you see different use cases forcing extensions onto validators
2026.23s - 2029.87s |  the way that descriptions are applied for other use cases?
2029.87s - 2031.87s |  Right now, you're really focused on customs.
2031.87s - 2033.35s |  Right. Customs officials.
2033.35s - 2038.75s |  And this problem that you mentioned of proliferation of proprietary scanners.
2039.31s - 2040.67s |  But what about like the U.S.
2040.67s - 2045.63s |  Cybertrust label for IOT devices that has metadata about those IOT devices?
2046.03s - 2048.31s |  Could that apply or would there be extensions?
2048.75s - 2054.71s |  So in the IETF, the way the politics work,
2054.71s - 2058.87s |  if you try and bite off something too large, it gets too many people's interest.
2059.11s - 2061.35s |  And then they all show up with their opinions.
2061.63s - 2063.39s |  And then nothing happens.
2063.39s - 2068.35s |  And so the constraining this to markings
2068.35s - 2072.59s |  required under international law is a constraint
2072.87s - 2076.19s |  that keeps people who are
2078.63s - 2081.59s |  interested in other things.
2081.59s - 2084.15s |  Often their silo instead of in this silo
2085.39s - 2089.35s |  or, you know, outside the tent, pissing out
2089.35s - 2092.59s |  rather than inside the tent, pissing in or I don't know.
2093.79s - 2096.71s |  But I mean, hypothetically, we get this work done.
2097.27s - 2101.27s |  And, you know, there's self-driving cars out there.
2101.43s - 2105.39s |  Wouldn't it be nice if the stoplight had a, you know,
2105.39s - 2108.51s |  official authorized by the city of Oakland, California?
2108.79s - 2111.03s |  You know, it's green right now.
2111.03s - 2114.11s |  And, you know, two seconds later, it's orange.
2114.11s - 2116.11s |  And two seconds after that, it's red.
2116.11s - 2117.95s |  Whatever. Right.
2117.95s - 2123.23s |  There are a zillion uses you can put something to once you have the tool.
2123.23s - 2126.67s |  Right. Once you standardize the tool, you've got all the libraries,
2126.67s - 2129.39s |  you've got all the open, you know, code.
2130.91s - 2132.03s |  There's a lot you can do.
2132.03s - 2135.75s |  So then then on the cryptographic side, you know, X509 and, you know,
2135.75s - 2139.91s |  different kinds of of encryption and and signing.
2141.23s - 2144.91s |  Again, we're trying to only add the little bit at the top,
2145.39s - 2147.47s |  not do any new crypto.
2147.47s - 2150.43s |  Right. All the crypto we're just inheriting out of DNSSEC.
2150.71s - 2153.55s |  And there are a lot of people who care about DNS security.
2153.79s - 2158.99s |  And a lot of people are working on, you know, post-quantum crypto for DNSSEC,
2159.91s - 2163.31s |  you know, elliptic curves that are not ones recommended by the NSA.
2163.87s - 2165.75s |  There's a lot of work going on there.
2165.75s - 2168.71s |  And if we try and do all that also.
2168.71s - 2170.95s |  It's just going to make everything more complicated.
2170.95s - 2175.35s |  One other thought or question on the loitering munition thing that you said,
2175.35s - 2177.67s |  I immediately thought, well,
2177.67s - 2182.99s |  someone's just going to mislabel their, you know, tank or other thing.
2182.99s - 2185.91s |  But I think that goes to the visual description integrity or something
2186.11s - 2190.47s |  there with with that and also the Hague piece that you mentioned
2190.67s - 2194.15s |  that the physical binding, you know, only goes so far.
2194.15s - 2196.83s |  Right. Like people will gain that.
2196.83s - 2198.15s |  Yeah. Yeah.
2198.15s - 2202.27s |  And one of the one of the things sorry, I didn't mention
2202.39s - 2207.51s |  if you've got a delivery mechanism that can actually deliver a lot of data,
2207.51s - 2212.75s |  like, you know, a big RFID can deliver, you know, many gigabytes of data.
2213.83s - 2217.75s |  You can take the whole thing and cram it in there.
2218.23s - 2223.87s |  And as long as the validator has cashed the root signatures,
2224.91s - 2227.59s |  then they can validate everything you hand them
2227.99s - 2232.43s |  based on following that signature chain, starting just with the root signature.
2232.87s - 2234.75s |  So you can do offline validation.
2234.75s - 2237.27s |  You don't need to be, you know, on the network.
2237.27s - 2241.55s |  So there there are a lot of people get very hung up on the military use cases
2241.55s - 2243.55s |  because they're kind of cool and fun.
2243.55s - 2249.19s |  And so a lot of people worry about covert inspection, right?
2249.19s - 2252.75s |  They want to be able to look at one of these things
2252.75s - 2256.39s |  without alerting anybody that they're looking and to do the validation
2256.39s - 2258.43s |  without alerting anybody that they're validating
2258.43s - 2261.59s |  because they don't want to warn people that they're about to attack something.
2261.95s - 2267.11s |  And so, you know, doing it this way gives you all of that already for free.
2267.11s - 2270.75s |  Right. Because you can hand over that data,
2270.95s - 2274.55s |  you know, on a beacon or whatever.
2275.55s - 2279.03s |  They can validate it using a single cash signature.
2280.19s - 2282.55s |  It's it's pretty robust.
2282.79s - 2285.19s |  I'm not sure if that covered your question, because honestly,
2285.19s - 2288.35s |  I can't actually hear more of the military use case.
2288.35s - 2291.95s |  And the first point that you said, it's a reiteration of your first
2291.95s - 2297.15s |  first point, basically, that it does nothing to honor the physical binding.
2297.63s - 2301.35s |  But military, you can gain the system because the crime
2301.35s - 2306.03s |  mislabel things in adversarial scenarios is where I was.
2306.07s - 2308.07s |  I think my brain was gone.
2308.07s - 2309.59s |  We can tell you what. Yeah.
2309.59s - 2313.91s |  Catch me after because I honestly can't hear a damn thing. Sorry.
2314.91s - 2318.11s |  And we're. Within a couple of minutes,
2318.11s - 2321.87s |  without a time right now, if there's one last question
2321.87s - 2324.55s |  and somebody can say it really loudly, we can do it.
2324.59s - 2327.91s |  Otherwise, let's call it.
2329.55s - 2331.47s |  Done a little bit early.
2331.59s - 2334.07s |  All right. Well, thank you all very, very much.
2335.19s - 2339.39s |  I guess you can see up there the URLs for the IETF documents.
2340.43s - 2340.87s |  Take care.
