1.23s - 8.23s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 All right. Let's start. So hi, I'm Tanya Jenka. I'm also known as SheHacksPurple, and I want
8.23s - 16.15s |  to talk about maturing our AppSec programs. So I work with companies all the time. I work
16.15s - 22.11s |  with customers a lot. I love my customers. And I see all different levels. But when I
22.11s - 28.35s |  work with someone, that means they take security seriously enough to engage me or to engage
28.35s - 35.03s |  some group or to engage IAN's research. There's tons of companies that haven't engaged anyone.
35.03s - 41.55s |  Like they don't have one of you to rely on, and they are like out there. And so I want
41.55s - 46.91s |  to talk about three different models of AppSec that I see a lot, and then how we could take
46.91s - 51.51s |  them to the next level. So if you are one of those models, that's cool. I can help you
51.51s - 55.79s |  do better. And so where are we going to talk about? We're going to talk about common AppSec
55.79s - 62.11s |  models, why they fail, and how we can just provide more value to our employers. Because
62.11s - 67.79s |  to be quite frank, we all want software to be more secure. That's what we want. And so
67.79s - 72.03s |  I want to briefly tell you how I did my research because someone pointed out to me, they're
72.03s - 75.35s |  like, you can't just say because Tanya said so. You actually have to explain like how
75.35s - 79.23s |  you learned these things. We can't just take your word for it. And I was like, you know,
79.23s - 84.19s |  that's a really good point. So I've been working with this company called IAN's Research since
84.19s - 89.11s |  I guess I started very, very late 2018. So let's call it 2019. And then I've worked with
89.11s - 94.65s |  almost 400 different AppSec teams over that time. You know how like there used to be that
94.65s - 100.35s |  game show online where you could phone a friend. So IAN's lets you phone a nerd. I'm one of
100.35s - 105.39s |  the nerds. And then I just help crush your AppSec programs. And I do between one and seven
105.39s - 110.41s |  calls a week. And then after so many years and taking so many notes, because I'm one
110.41s - 115.25s |  of those obsessive note taker persons because I can't remember anything. I just realized
115.25s - 119.37s |  like, wow, I have a lot of data. And when you have 400 companies that you've spread
119.37s - 124.77s |  the data across, it's no longer like it's a data set. It's no longer you're talking
124.77s - 128.89s |  about this company. It's a data set. And I was like, I need to start sharing this data
128.89s - 134.47s |  in an anonymized ways. And so this is one of the talks where I'm sharing that data after
134.47s - 139.23s |  so many years. And so thank you to IAN's Research for actually giving me money because it's
139.23s - 143.47s |  pretty cool to get paid to just do really awesome work. So I'm this person when I brush
143.47s - 148.95s |  my hair, I look pretty good. I work at SunGrep and I'm the head of community there. And they're
148.95s - 153.67s |  very gracious and let me do lots of silly things like make cards against AppSec. I'm
153.67s - 158.95s |  known as SheXPurple. I wrote a book called Alice and Bob Learn Application Security.
158.95s - 164.45s |  So this is year 28 in tech for me. I'm old. I founded some stuff. I advise some people
164.65s - 169.49s |  and I do some research. And so hopefully you're like, she seems qualified enough. I guess
169.49s - 175.21s |  I'm not going to leave. I'll sit down. It's hot. Don't leave. So I want to talk about
175.21s - 182.21s |  maturity. So how do I say? So this is like, so it says like, Tanya, gently explain that.
185.31s - 191.81s |  So we as an industry, some of us are doing great and that is not very many of us. A lot
191.81s - 198.13s |  of us are AppSec programs where like, I wish it was so much better. We don't feel super
198.13s - 203.01s |  like we're not bragging to our friends. We're not like, we're just not as satisfied with
203.01s - 208.49s |  how it's going. And we know this because we keep seeing giant breaches, right? We keep
208.49s - 214.31s |  seeing software development not going as securely and reliably as we expect it to. Like the
214.31s - 220.09s |  whole thing with CrowdStrike was just us not following proper software development practices,
220.09s - 225.69s |  trusting the way we know we should. And they know too, because there's so many pressures.
225.69s - 231.13s |  And so this talks about how we can mature because the whole industry is not where the
231.13s - 236.83s |  people in this room are. The people in this room, you came probably from another country
236.83s - 241.43s |  or from another part in this country to this place to learn, to become better. Everyone
241.43s - 245.21s |  else isn't doing that, right? Only some of us are. So there's a bit of the cream of the
245.21s - 248.65s |  crop going on here. So if you're like, of course we would do that. Yeah, you would,
248.97s - 254.61s |  but not everyone's doing it. So I want us to all kind of continue on that. So one of
254.61s - 260.45s |  the issues I see with, so there are some models. So there's OWASP, SAM, BSIM and NIST. I actually
260.45s - 265.17s |  haven't used BSIM because it costs money and I'm very cheap. You'd be surprised. But I've
265.17s - 270.49s |  done a lot of SAM and a lot of NIST. And these, when I talk with customers, they're like,
270.49s - 274.09s |  oh, let's do a maturity model. And I'm like, great. And then I start telling them about
274.09s - 279.45s |  it and they're so overwhelmed. I went to a SAM, an OWASP SAM user meetup. So SAM's
279.45s - 285.69s |  awesome just to be clear. And it's not a person, it's the software assurance maturity model.
285.69s - 290.13s |  And they were telling me that on average, their user group, so the people that are obsessed
290.13s - 296.67s |  with SAM, they rate at like 1.1 out of three. So these are the people that have been doing
296.67s - 300.93s |  SAM for years, working their butts off and they're barely getting one out of three. So
300.93s - 306.09s |  when I ask a client who's like, what does AppSec stand for? To look at SAM, their eyes
306.09s - 310.53s |  glaze over, they start to cry. They're just like, I can't even, I can't even fathom where
310.53s - 316.57s |  to start. So I'm going to start below that. Okay. Because that's where we are. So onto
316.57s - 322.81s |  the models. I just like cats and this is the OSI model, but with cats. Anyway. Okay. So
322.81s - 327.65s |  model one, let's just pen test the important things. Who has worked with a client at some
327.69s - 332.33s |  point where that's all they do. So like once or twice a year, they have a pen tester come
332.33s - 338.65s |  in, they do a pen test, they fail it so bad. And, and then they're like, yeah, that's our
338.65s - 344.13s |  AppSec program. And I'm like, whoa, that's expensive for what you're getting. Like pen
344.13s - 348.21s |  testing is awesome. But if that's the only thing you're doing, and you're just pen testing
348.21s - 355.57s |  like two of your 200 apps once a year, you're getting a blink of a tiny, tiny portion of
355.57s - 362.33s |  your entire attack surface. And like, this is not going to go well. And so unfortunately,
362.33s - 366.93s |  even in 2024, lots of companies are starting their first AppSec program. Like last year, I
366.93s - 371.61s |  worked with a gaming company and you own their games. And I helped them start their first
371.61s - 378.33s |  AppSec program. And so this, this year I trained a company that handles $2 billion of
378.49s - 383.57s |  their customers' money. And they were letting every single person at the company query the
383.57s - 387.77s |  production database using the same user. And then they take client scripts, and they
387.77s - 392.37s |  just run it without any checking against the database that handles $2 billion. And I was
392.37s - 399.01s |  like, oh, okay, we redesigned it. Life is way better now. Like everything's going right,
399.01s - 405.37s |  but like $2 billion. And that's what they were doing. Right. So at least these people
405.37s - 409.29s |  are doing two pen tests a year because they were doing literally nothing before I got
409.29s - 415.37s |  there in March. So yeah. So let's talk about this model. So it is extremely common.
415.73s - 419.97s |  Generally, there's no formal system development lifecycle. They're like, we're doing
420.45s - 427.29s |  WaterGile. We're doing DevOpsGile. We're doing, you know, we have a scrum meeting, but
427.29s - 433.29s |  it's only once a week. And then like, we do sprints, but they're six months long. Every
433.29s - 439.25s |  single team is doing something different. There's a mixed tech stack. So we have like
439.29s - 442.93s |  five different programming languages, and 12 different versions of six different
442.93s - 447.61s |  frameworks. And then like, some of us are using PaaS, some of us are using IAC, like
447.61s - 453.69s |  everyone just like, let's do our own thing. It's great. It's not. We have code all over
453.69s - 458.97s |  the place. So I'm like, oh, where do you keep your code? They're like, so about that. And
458.97s - 464.17s |  it's in like five different types of repositories, but there's actually like 22
464.17s - 469.05s |  instances. So you don't even know where your code is. Um, yeah, everyone's just kind of
469.05s - 474.37s |  doing their own thing. And that's not good. So why is this model bad? I think you already
474.37s - 478.61s |  know, but let me tell you. So it's quite expensive for what you're getting. So pen
478.61s - 484.49s |  testers are not cheap, like good ones are not cheap, and they shouldn't be. But usually, I
484.49s - 489.33s |  like to do pen testing as like this beautiful cherry on top to make something perfect, not
489.33s - 494.61s |  as my only effort whatsoever. And so you're having terrible, terrible coverage. Developers
494.61s - 500.05s |  are getting zero support. Like there's no opportunity for anyone to learn. That's one
500.05s - 503.81s |  of the biggest problems with this one. None of your staff's getting better, because you
503.81s - 507.69s |  have this awesome, brilliant pen tester coming in doing cool work, and then all their super
507.69s - 512.69s |  awesome brain and knowledge leaves. Right. And so that is one of the many reasons this
512.69s - 518.97s |  is bad. And so how can we mature this model? So I have, so this one, I have the, if you
518.97s - 524.93s |  have budget, and if you don't have budget, a lot of my career, my budget has not been
524.93s - 528.13s |  quite what I want. I totally have an awesome budget now running a community. It's like
528.13s - 534.97s |  8,000 bucks anyway. Um, how do we mature this model? So first I like to start with secure
534.97s - 539.89s |  coding training, and I'm going to give you a link to free training for secure coding
539.89s - 543.93s |  after this. There's going to be a bunch of free resources because I want all of you to
543.93s - 550.05s |  be awesome. Um, but the way I teach secure coding training is not the same way as someone
550.05s - 555.01s |  else does. And so, although obviously I'm the best ever, what you want is training that
555.01s - 560.05s |  works for your team, that your team likes. And so as much as like a salesperson will
560.05s - 564.41s |  tell you ours is the best ever, what only really matters is that your team likes it
564.41s - 569.19s |  and that your team's willing to sit through it or go on the platform and play or attend
569.19s - 573.83s |  the monthly lunch and learns, whatever it is that you decide, try it out on some devs
573.83s - 579.55s |  first and make sure that they're willing to tolerate it. Don't pay $12,000 to have someone
579.55s - 586.35s |  come in that they hate, right? Or a system or whatever it is that you do, try to make
586.35s - 591.27s |  sure it's a thing that they'll tolerate. Um, so the no budget plan. So for those of us
591.27s - 596.11s |  that don't have giant budgets, you don't have to raise your hands cause it's sad. Um, okay.
596.11s - 601.15s |  So one, so use free tools like zap and burp if you're going to do dynamic scanning and
601.15s - 605.83s |  then for static analysis. So for, for dynamic analysis, there's basically like two super
605.83s - 609.99s |  clear awesome winners. And then for stack analysis, like there's tons, like I could
609.99s - 614.83s |  fill this whole page. So like there's many, many, many open source SAS that are free.
614.83s - 621.27s |  They're like, not bad, not bad. Um, and then create a guideline. And I have one online
621.27s - 626.31s |  again, that's free, but basically create some sort of guidance for your devs about
626.31s - 631.55s |  how to create code that you feel is acceptable. And it's totally okay to steal something off
631.55s - 636.15s |  of my website, off the OS website, off of like websites that give you permission to
636.15s - 641.91s |  do that. So you don't have to reinvent the wheel, but give them some guidance. Um, next
641.91s - 648.75s |  create, create a list of requirements. So when you start a project, you set clear expectations
648.75s - 654.43s |  for security for everyone on that project. And this could be just like five things.
654.43s - 657.27s |  Like you're going to scan it with our little SAS. You're going to scan it with our little
657.27s - 661.87s |  desk. You're going to fix the mediums and above, and then we're going to do a pen test
661.87s - 667.83s |  at the end. That could just be your entire requirements, right? And follow the guideline.
667.83s - 671.83s |  Like it doesn't have to be really advanced and you can add to it over time, but starting
671.83s - 675.91s |  a project with super clear expectations will get you a lot more of what you want in this
675.91s - 681.71s |  world. Um, consolidate your code. So this is a really hard one. This is one of those
681.71s - 684.67s |  things where you're going to have to talk to lots of people, but if your code is all
684.67s - 690.43s |  in the same place, your life's going to be better. Um, the devs will also probably enjoy
690.43s - 693.91s |  that once it happens, like while we're doing it, it's going to suck. But once it's all
693.91s - 699.47s |  in the same place, like everyone's going to benefit, not just you. And then lastly, oh,
699.47s - 703.11s |  actually no, I have a whole nother page. Push for a real system development lifecycle, push
703.11s - 707.43s |  for centralization, push for standardization. This is a really hard one that requires a
707.43s - 713.27s |  lot of social currency, but it is worth every single hour that you spend talking to people
713.27s - 717.35s |  to make that happen. Like every single person in your whole it department will benefit from
717.35s - 722.91s |  that. Okay. Number six, threat model, the super important apps. So those ones that you
722.91s - 727.11s |  used to just pen test and that's all you did do a threat model. You can do a super basic
727.11s - 731.43s |  threat model. Um, there's this amazing human named Adam show stack. He has this thing called
731.43s - 737.03s |  the four question frame for threat modeling is just four questions and a conversation.
737.03s - 742.19s |  I start with that. It's so good. He's so smart. Um, you don't have to read all of his awesome
742.19s - 747.51s |  books, but you totally could. And like, just start with that and you will get really far
747.51s - 753.55s |  share information about incidents. So if you've had an app incident, if you're allowed, if
753.55s - 757.95s |  it makes sense, share with the devs. Quite often when I started talking to them about
757.95s - 762.35s |  security incidents, they had no idea. They had no idea we've been attacked. They had
762.35s - 766.99s |  no idea we're attacked 4 billion times a day. They have no idea this stuff's happening and
766.99s - 772.55s |  I'm not doing it to scare their pants off. I want them to understand the threats we face.
772.55s - 776.55s |  So I'm not trying to fear uncertainty and doubt. I'm like, this is specifically what
776.55s - 783.31s |  is happening to us and why I need your help so bad. Um, scan for secrets. There are free
783.31s - 787.63s |  secret scanners. There's paid for secret scanners. Basically if you have more time, you should
787.63s - 792.15s |  use a free one. If you have more money, she's a paid one, but basically scan your code for
792.15s - 795.91s |  secrets and then rotate those secrets. Use a secret management tool, but that's later
795.91s - 801.87s |  for when you have money. Um, there's a free WAF from OWASP called mod security and you
801.87s - 809.03s |  can put that in front of your super scary, terrible, like last updated in 2008 apps.
809.03s - 814.99s |  Do that. Um, and then you still pen test the important apps. However, now you don't fail
814.99s - 818.83s |  horribly and it's no longer completely embarrassing where you're like, Oh God, I can't look the
818.83s - 824.39s |  pen tester in the face. This is so bad. Um, so that's nice. And then, so now if you have
824.39s - 828.19s |  budget, I want to add three more things. So if you have budget, see how she kind of looks
828.19s - 833.87s |  like a badass. She's like, I have budget, hire an app sec person. Like that is the best
833.87s - 839.71s |  investment you can ever make. Like hire someone from this room. Um, like seriously, the people
839.71s - 844.79s |  there in this room, probably almost all of them will be amazing to work with. Um, pay
844.79s - 851.27s |  for a next gen SAST. So I find that the paid SAS are a lot better than the paid tasks.
851.27s - 855.07s |  I kind of think that sucks. And I remember people telling me at the beginning of my app
855.07s - 858.75s |  sec career that DAS sucks. I'm like, DAS is amazing. And they're like, one day when you're
858.75s - 865.39s |  a more mature app sec professional, Tanya, you'll understand. And one day I just did,
865.39s - 870.67s |  I'm sorry if you make a DAS, I'm a jerk. Um, continue with your free-ish DAS. I just
870.67s - 877.23s |  would never buy one. Um, and then all of step two. So still do the no budget plan. So this
877.23s - 884.47s |  is model one. And now we're going to do model two. All right. Model tool. Like I call this
884.47s - 890.59s |  tools, tools and more tools. Um, so this is the most common thing. I see this absolutely
890.59s - 895.15s |  all the time. Actually, let me go back for a second. So this is SAS plus DAS, perhaps
895.15s - 901.91s |  one other tool, a little bit of governance. Okay. So partially rolled out tools. This
901.91s - 909.63s |  is the most common thing. So partially rolled out. So we've paid $75,000 for a DAS and like
909.63s - 915.67s |  $60,000 for a SAS. And we are totally using 20% of our licenses, which I hate. I work
915.67s - 923.37s |  for a vendor. Take every penny you can. You paid for it. Lots of bug reports, but ain't
923.37s - 927.05s |  no one fixing anything. So we've got lots of reports. They're not getting to the right
927.05s - 931.85s |  people. Maybe there's lots of false positives. Maybe we're just not distributing them well.
931.85s - 936.81s |  Maybe we're just not scanning the right things. Maybe we're scanning so rarely that it's unhelpful,
936.81s - 943.29s |  but things are just not getting fixed. Um, inconsistent program. So I see this a lot.
943.29s - 947.89s |  I see huge inconsistencies. Like one team has to do this huge architecture review. And
947.89s - 954.05s |  I worked at this one place and they had an 80 page template. So it was like 160 pages when
954.05s - 957.93s |  you filled it out. And guess how many people filled it out? Zero. You can't see I'm doing
957.93s - 963.41s |  this. Yeah. Um, no, that doesn't work. And usually they always have a SAS and a DAS,
963.41s - 968.45s |  um, little to no documentation. And the most common thing anyone ever says is,
968.45s - 973.65s |  why won't the devs fix the bugs? I'm never going to talk to them or interact with them
973.81s - 977.89s |  or provide support. I'm not going to even ask them this question. I'm going to ask everyone
977.89s - 981.65s |  else in the entire company this question. This is a thing that I hear all the time. I'm like,
981.65s - 986.21s |  did you ask the devs why they're not fixing it? No. When's the last time you talked to them? Never.
987.25s - 992.69s |  I see the beginning of your problem. So why is this model bad? I really like dragons and I just
992.69s - 999.09s |  wanted to have dragons in my presentation. Um, okay. So the coverage is bad. It's not terrible.
999.09s - 1005.25s |  It's not like the last one, but the coverage is bad. Not much is fixed. So we as an industry are
1005.25s - 1012.05s |  not here to find bugs. We are here to reduce organizational risk in a meaningful and lasting
1012.05s - 1017.73s |  way. That's our job. It does not matter if you find 45,000 bugs, you've found every bug that
1017.73s - 1023.49s |  exists. If no one's fixing anything, in my opinion, your paycheck is too big. What we
1023.49s - 1027.97s |  want to do is fix the things. We want to prevent the things from happening in the first place.
1027.97s - 1033.81s |  We want to protect artworks and you're just not doing it as well as you could with this program.
1033.81s - 1040.53s |  And so how do we mature it? I used an AI to make this. I was like, show me a little girl
1040.53s - 1045.01s |  growing up and becoming more mature. And this is what the AI gave me. I'm like, I'll take it.
1045.01s - 1049.89s |  Sounds good. Okay. So we want to do everything from the previous maturity model. I was like,
1049.89s - 1053.81s |  show me a little girl maturing. And this is, I guess this is how little girls mature now.
1054.29s - 1059.33s |  Okay. So then the number one thing I would do is hire more AppSec folks. And I realize I am
1059.33s - 1067.41s |  an AppSec folks. So I am biased, but I kind of think we're awesome. But really though, AppSec folks.
1068.53s - 1074.05s |  Okay. So one of the pieces of advice is your entire AppSec team can not just be pen testers.
1075.25s - 1080.29s |  You have to have one of those people at least because we need them, but you can't have a team
1080.37s - 1084.21s |  but you can't have a team where you have five AppSec folks and every single one of them's just
1084.21s - 1088.85s |  got the pen testing skills. And like, they don't, none of them have ever been a dev. None of them
1088.85s - 1092.61s |  know how to read code or maybe they do know how to read code, but like they just know how to do
1092.61s - 1096.53s |  pen testing. They don't know how to do code review. They don't know how to do a threat model.
1096.53s - 1101.97s |  They don't know how to write a policy. So you need a well-rounded AppSec team with a whole bunch of
1101.97s - 1106.61s |  different types of skill sets. That's very important. One of them needs to have that pen
1106.61s - 1110.93s |  tester. I'm going to F up your shit type of thing. But the rest of them, like you have to
1110.93s - 1116.61s |  have a rainbow type of team. This is one of those times when diversity can, like diversity of
1116.61s - 1123.81s |  experience and like skillset will really, really bring you a lot of value. Reassess your tools.
1123.81s - 1129.73s |  So if it's been two or three years and you still haven't rolled your SAS, DAST, AST, whatever
1129.73s - 1135.49s |  acronym thing out, it's the wrong tool. Done. You're done with it. Switch tools.
1136.29s - 1139.97s |  I find that I'll work with companies and they're like, well, we've had it five years. And I'm like,
1139.97s - 1144.77s |  yeah, and you're using 30% of your licenses. So for five years, you've been paying for 70%
1144.77s - 1151.17s |  of things you're not using. You've wasted this many dollars. It's not working for you. It's like
1151.17s - 1158.05s |  the sunk cost fallacy applies. Just get rid of it. Start again. Find a tool and make sure you
1158.05s - 1164.13s |  evaluate it with your devs and make sure the rollout is fast. Don't buy a tool if it's going
1164.13s - 1168.45s |  to take you two years to roll it out. I wanted to buy this IAST once. I was like so in love with it.
1168.45s - 1172.69s |  I really, really wanted to buy it. And after three months, we still had not finished the proof of
1172.69s - 1177.01s |  concept because I just couldn't get the team to roll it out. And my boss was like, you're going
1177.01s - 1182.29s |  to roll this out for the rest of your career if we buy it. So it needs to be something that rolls
1182.29s - 1190.05s |  out fast. Ensure your rollout's complete. Make the vendor give you every penny of value you paid for.
1190.05s - 1194.61s |  Put us through our paces. I know that may sound like strange advice from a person that
1194.61s - 1199.33s |  works at one of those places, but you should get every single bit of value you can for that thing
1199.33s - 1204.69s |  you're paying for. And the thing you can do is if at six months, you still are not able to roll out
1204.69s - 1208.69s |  all the licenses, you can say, well, you know what? It's been six months and we haven't been
1208.69s - 1212.77s |  able to roll them out. Maybe I don't want to pay for the rest of the six months for those licenses
1212.77s - 1218.45s |  we're not using. Some companies I've been able to do is I'll say, I want to buy half in the first
1218.45s - 1221.89s |  six months and the other half in the next six months, because I know it's going to take a long
1221.89s - 1227.49s |  time. But ideally just get something that's easy to roll out if that is a possibility for you and
1227.49s - 1232.85s |  the way that your stack looks, because it's not always possible. The hardest advice ever,
1232.85s - 1239.33s |  provide support, make friends, talk to people, build trust. This is hard. So this can mean
1239.33s - 1245.89s |  writing a one pager with security guidance, helping them with their frameworks. Being available is
1245.89s - 1250.13s |  really, really hard because I know all of you are probably really, really busy, but this is
1250.13s - 1254.13s |  something that creates a ton of value and you don't have to dye your hair purple. It just helps. All
1254.13s - 1259.09s |  of you actually look really good in purple. Some of you just don't know it yet. Start to manage
1259.09s - 1265.01s |  incidents better. Send your team on incident response training if you can. Figure out a way
1265.01s - 1270.21s |  for actually, let me do this. Create a way to report incidents really quickly. Do incident
1270.21s - 1274.61s |  training for devs so they know what it looks like and they can tell you when they see something bad
1274.61s - 1279.89s |  and then create an incident response process. Make sure everyone knows it that needs to know it.
1279.89s - 1284.05s |  A lot of these companies, they don't got nothing. They're really good at responding to malware.
1284.05s - 1288.29s |  They're ready for ransomware. Everything else, they have no plan whatsoever.
1289.41s - 1294.05s |  Model three. And we have how many minutes left? We have five minutes. Okay. I call this the
1294.05s - 1301.89s |  stranglehold big spend. So you have every single tool. You have like 11 tools. You've spent all
1301.89s - 1307.57s |  the money. You have a stranglehold governance. No one can breathe. It takes three weeks to make
1307.57s - 1313.97s |  a one line change of code. There's constant friction. The security posture is not satisfying
1313.97s - 1320.37s |  for how much you're spending and sec and dev don't talk unless they're yelling. I have worked here
1320.37s - 1327.01s |  so many times. And you come in and I remember my friend Nicole, she's like, I walk in and I'm like,
1327.01s - 1332.29s |  hey, I'm Nicole. I'm from security. I come in peace. And then I put my hands out like this.
1332.29s - 1337.41s |  And hopefully people laugh. Sometimes they boo. And then I know what level I'm at to start and
1337.41s - 1343.33s |  how much peacemaking I need to do. But the I come in peace really works well. So why is this model
1343.33s - 1349.89s |  bad? You're spending a zillion dollars and you are not getting your money's worth. You are slowing
1349.89s - 1355.57s |  down innovation. Maybe even people are quitting because they just can't stand how annoying,
1355.57s - 1361.57s |  how much friction there is. You, the security team are petting the cat, which is a dev backwards
1361.57s - 1367.25s |  all day long. And the devs are just like, oh, I used to work somewhere where I literally I saw
1367.25s - 1372.69s |  the security guy. And then I went like this and my boss was like, did you literally just duck?
1372.69s - 1379.49s |  And I was like, I'm so busted. Don't we don't want to be that. None of us want to be that.
1379.49s - 1384.85s |  We're that way because so many other cultural things have happened. That's what led us to that.
1384.85s - 1391.01s |  So I suggest scaling with either a security champions program, delegation, like specific
1391.01s - 1397.17s |  delegation, automation. So I have like a bunch of things I can talk about how to scale your
1397.17s - 1403.89s |  program better. But if you do a champs program, it's a big undertaking. Be serious about it. Be
1403.89s - 1409.01s |  intentional. Do a really good job. I would love to talk to you about that after. I'm a big giant fan.
1409.01s - 1413.33s |  I'm a bit obsessive. If you're not going to do a champions program, do an advocacy program to
1413.33s - 1418.85s |  change the culture where you work so it's more positive. Make it a standard. Take all your
1418.85s - 1423.41s |  guidance and guidelines, turn them into standards because you're ready for that now. And then provide
1423.41s - 1429.09s |  training and workshops on how to apply that and help everyone become compliant. You will make
1429.09s - 1433.09s |  friends, not enemies that way. Instead of just publishing a policy and then being like, good
1433.09s - 1439.01s |  luck with that. Make your tools go fast. You want fast tools. You are paying a fortune. You deserve
1439.01s - 1444.05s |  fast, efficient tools full of true positives. If you're not getting it, break up.
1445.49s - 1449.97s |  Examine your APIs. So at this point, you should be taking care of your APIs, not just your front
1449.97s - 1455.65s |  end web apps. You should be taking care of every type of software, including mobile, including IoT,
1455.65s - 1460.37s |  including WebSockets. All of those things need attention now. And you might need to get a special
1460.37s - 1464.53s |  subset of your tools to make sure you pay them the special attention they deserve.
1465.33s - 1471.09s |  Embrace threat modeling, threat modeling rules. You want a company-wide secret management at this
1471.09s - 1476.93s |  point. I do not sell a secret management tool. I wish I did because they are amazing and you need
1476.93s - 1484.21s |  one. Your whole company should have a management program, like an app, but also just like a plan
1484.21s - 1489.09s |  to manage your secrets as a whole so that you never, ever leak a secret again. You want to do
1489.09s - 1494.21s |  continuous scanning. And I don't mean this in like a swear word marketing buzzword type of way.
1494.21s - 1498.45s |  I mean like set up your tools so they're always scanning all the time and you're reviewing them
1498.45s - 1503.17s |  when you see something disconcerting. You can do this with more modern tools where they're just
1503.17s - 1508.53s |  kind of scanning on their own and then you review it when you have time. Training that doesn't suck.
1509.33s - 1513.97s |  Evaluate the training with your devs to see if they actually like it. Do the one they like.
1514.77s - 1519.97s |  Do the one that they're willing to tolerate. This might mean it's like one day a week for
1519.97s - 1526.21s |  three weeks. It might mean it's a one hour every other week. It might mean it's a full day for
1526.21s - 1531.17s |  three days in a row and it's interactive and they get to like move around. There's many different
1531.17s - 1536.13s |  types of trainings. Don't just go with the cheap one. Don't just go with the popular one. Go with
1536.13s - 1542.93s |  the one they like the best because you will get the best results. If you have a WAF on stuff,
1542.93s - 1547.17s |  if you have the money to a rasp, it's just better. I know a lot of people are going to
1547.17s - 1553.17s |  swear at me about that after. Your AppSec team should be trained in incident response or your
1553.17s - 1558.85s |  incident response team should have some training in AppSec so that if a real AppSec incident like
1558.85s - 1564.53s |  a big one happens, you are ready. This is more advanced and that's okay. And lastly, use a data
1564.53s - 1570.85s |  driven approach. See that giant smile he has? It's gorgeous. It's wonderful because he's using data
1570.85s - 1575.41s |  to improve his program. I talk about this a lot too. You should be gathering metrics on the
1575.41s - 1581.25s |  regular and then using that to do experiments and then improving, improving, improving. Whatever's
1581.25s - 1585.33s |  not working, you throw it out. Whatever is working, you do more of that. I know that sounds
1585.33s - 1591.17s |  obvious, but taking that time every 90 days to look at your metrics and improve will bring you
1591.17s - 1597.17s |  huge value over time. And I totally have one minute left. So conclusion, we learned three
1597.17s - 1601.81s |  common AppSec models, how to identify the models, how to improve the models and build a better
1601.81s - 1606.53s |  program. But more importantly, if you want to get your phones out, I have some resources. So
1607.25s - 1613.49s |  I have free secure coding courses, AppSec courses. Next week I'm releasing incident response for devs,
1613.49s - 1618.45s |  all of it's free. There is no payment except we add you to our newsletter, but me and my colleague
1618.45s - 1623.33s |  Amanda write it and I think it doesn't suck very much. And you can just unsubscribe if you don't
1623.33s - 1630.13s |  like it, but I didn't say that. Okay, next books. I love books. These books are not free. I only
1630.13s - 1634.85s |  wrote one of them and my mom says that one's the best one, but I love DevOps and I feel like us
1634.85s - 1639.81s |  security folks can learn a lot from the amazing DevOps folks, especially the researchers. This is
1639.81s - 1645.81s |  really good content. Cyber Mentoring Monday, every single Monday on Twitter and on Mastodon InfoSec
1645.81s - 1651.89s |  Exchange, I use this hashtag to match with people. I have so many people write me and they want an
1651.89s - 1657.09s |  AppSec mentor and the people in this room, if you would answer one of them, you will make the whole
1657.09s - 1661.57s |  year. Seriously, you've changed someone's entire life when you answer their call.
1661.57s - 1666.85s |  And if I can just ask one favor from you is to answer someone and have a virtual coffee with them,
1666.85s - 1672.53s |  recommend a book, recommend a talk, just giving them your time and encouragement can literally
1672.53s - 1679.49s |  change their entire career trajectory. And then lastly, me, I am a nerd on the internet. I do this
1679.49s - 1683.73s |  all the time. It's basically all I do. I love giving stuff away for free. I'm not as good at
1683.73s - 1690.45s |  business, but I'm really good at sharing. I am SheHacksPurple on all the things. And then lastly,
1691.09s - 1695.49s |  thank you. Thank you so much for coming. There's so much cool stuff and you came to see this.
