0.00s - 2.80s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 First of all, what's the name of this talk?
6.58s - 7.66s |  Anyone?
7.66s - 8.82s |  You have to shout.
18.24s - 21.35s |  How about that?
21.35s - 25.07s |  And then an example of something called a Caesar cipher,
25.07s - 29.57s |  so simple substitution cipher in our tech industry,
29.57s - 33.93s |  we sometimes call it rot rotation cipher.
35.31s - 36.47s |  My name is Jeff Mann.
36.51s - 40.95s |  I am a former NSA cryptologist,
40.95s - 44.99s |  consultant advisor, industry old timer,
44.99s - 47.43s |  and feel free to reach out to me anytime
47.43s - 49.19s |  for questions, mentoring.
51.35s - 53.21s |  Take pictures, send them to me.
55.43s - 58.07s |  Spent the early part of my career, as I said, at NSA.
58.07s - 60.31s |  I've been out for almost 30 years now.
61.99s - 64.93s |  20 years ago, I got into doing something called PCI.
66.47s - 69.23s |  Has PCI ever been said from stage at DEF CON before?
69.23s - 73.72s |  I don't know.
74.76s - 76.48s |  Most people in this industry know me
76.48s - 79.12s |  because I was one of the architects,
79.12s - 81.18s |  one of the founders of what came to be known
81.18s - 83.36s |  as the first NSA red team.
83.36s - 86.56s |  So I was doing pen testing back in the early 90s
86.56s - 90.26s |  and did it up until about the mid 90s for NSA.
90.26s - 93.50s |  But I was also a cryptanalyst at NSA,
93.50s - 95.20s |  which is why I'm here talking,
95.20s - 98.00s |  representing the crypto and privacy village, by the way.
101.12s - 104.68s |  I was working as a cryptologist designing systems
104.68s - 106.28s |  back in the late 80s.
106.28s - 107.28s |  One of the things I did,
107.28s - 110.72s |  because computers were becoming a thing,
110.72s - 113.60s |  the digital age was becoming a thing.
113.60s - 115.36s |  I had a client that asked
115.36s - 120.16s |  if they could do a paper manual process on a PC
120.16s - 121.36s |  and was able to produce
121.36s - 125.02s |  what I think was the first software-based NSA produced,
125.02s - 126.76s |  which only did half of it.
126.80s - 130.12s |  The spy in the field was still using the paper,
130.12s - 133.30s |  but the case handler was using a PC
133.30s - 137.54s |  and got the one-time pad key put on floppy disk.
138.82s - 141.24s |  I also had another customer, U.S. Special Forces,
141.24s - 143.36s |  that I designed a cipher wheel for
143.36s - 146.10s |  that would help them with their encryption and decryption
146.10s - 151.49s |  in the field of one-time pads.
151.49s - 155.79s |  But this is just a little bit of cryptographic history
155.79s - 158.57s |  to explain where we came from in cryptography.
158.61s - 160.21s |  You were just hearing a talk
160.21s - 163.19s |  talking about encryption that works in the digital age.
164.57s - 167.53s |  But basically people have been trying to keep secrets
167.53s - 169.41s |  for thousands of years.
169.41s - 170.57s |  And in the early days,
170.57s - 172.61s |  it was primarily keeping secrets
172.61s - 176.53s |  and communicating messages from one end to another,
176.53s - 178.97s |  very often used by the military,
178.97s - 181.21s |  trying to get commands and directions
181.21s - 184.17s |  to troops on the battlefield from the command headquarters
184.17s - 186.37s |  and the generals and things like that.
187.21s - 190.77s |  There's basically, historically,
190.77s - 192.41s |  two different ways of doing that,
192.41s - 195.09s |  two different ways of protecting messages,
195.09s - 196.99s |  and that's called codes and ciphers.
198.61s - 201.67s |  The difference between the two, very briefly,
201.67s - 204.25s |  the way I learned it many years ago,
204.25s - 209.25s |  is code is something you do to words and phrases
210.01s - 212.89s |  or thoughts and ideas to try to shrink it down
212.89s - 215.73s |  to something that's briefer to transmit
215.79s - 217.25s |  and to communicate,
217.25s - 219.97s |  whereas a cipher is something you're doing
219.97s - 224.47s |  to scramble and create what used to be called a cryptogram,
224.47s - 226.61s |  but it's a one character, one letter,
226.61s - 229.65s |  one number relationship.
230.57s - 232.35s |  There's two ways of doing that.
232.35s - 237.35s |  One way is to do the title of this talk, a substitution.
237.53s - 240.51s |  You're replacing the real letters, the real characters,
240.51s - 243.07s |  for something obscure and different
243.07s - 244.99s |  in hopes of confusing people,
244.99s - 248.07s |  which seemed to work since a lot and lot of people,
248.07s - 249.31s |  not a lot of people seem to know
249.31s - 250.79s |  what the name of the talk was.
251.67s - 254.39s |  The other thing you can do is you simply
255.71s - 258.17s |  scramble the letters,
259.75s - 262.23s |  same letters, just put them in a different order
262.23s - 264.95s |  in some way where the intended recipient
264.95s - 267.61s |  knows how to put it back together.
267.61s - 269.71s |  I can give you a real brief example.
271.09s - 274.49s |  This is an example of a transposition.
275.15s - 276.75s |  Anybody know what my shirt says?
280.32s - 281.72s |  Close.
281.72s - 283.32s |  Too many secrets.
283.32s - 284.52s |  Too many secrets.
284.52s - 285.36s |  Very good.
288.27s - 291.39s |  In terms of US history,
291.39s - 294.03s |  back in the American Revolution,
294.03s - 296.21s |  there was codes and ciphers used,
296.21s - 299.55s |  and an example of a code would be
300.43s - 302.53s |  one if by land, two if by sea.
303.91s - 307.53s |  Big, long phrases reduced down to just a light
307.89s - 310.19s |  or two lights in a church bell tower.
311.77s - 316.17s |  There was also codes being used by the armies.
316.17s - 318.21s |  They had entire code books written up
318.21s - 321.49s |  where numbers would represent all sorts of words,
321.49s - 326.49s |  and just as an example, there was Agent 711,
326.65s - 329.93s |  which was actually the code for George Washington,
329.93s - 334.82s |  General of the Army.
334.82s - 336.46s |  They also were using ciphers,
336.46s - 338.90s |  but in this particular instance,
338.90s - 342.30s |  they weren't using letters to replace letters.
342.30s - 346.18s |  They were using symbols, but it was still a Caesar cipher.
346.18s - 349.18s |  It was still a simple substitution system,
349.18s - 350.56s |  and of course, Caesar cipher,
350.56s - 352.58s |  that was actually used by the Confederate Army
352.58s - 353.78s |  in the Civil War.
353.78s - 357.14s |  They had a cipher wheel themselves,
357.14s - 358.56s |  which was part of the inspiration
358.56s - 362.22s |  for the cipher wheel that I designed many years later.
364.78s - 368.66s |  Freemasons, they have loved to use ciphers
369.42s - 371.62s |  for many years, the particular cipher they use.
371.62s - 374.18s |  These are examples of tombstones
374.18s - 376.66s |  of dead members of the Freemasons,
376.66s - 378.66s |  and they often would leave messages,
378.66s - 382.30s |  encrypted messages on their tombstones
382.30s - 384.66s |  using something called a pigpen cipher,
384.66s - 387.26s |  where instead of letters, they would write letters
387.26s - 389.90s |  into like tic-tac-toe squares,
389.90s - 391.82s |  and instead of the letters,
391.82s - 394.50s |  they would simply use the shape of the box
394.50s - 396.58s |  or the cell that the letter fell in.
396.58s - 401.47s |  This is kind of what it looks like.
401.47s - 403.79s |  If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure,
403.79s - 406.75s |  they have something that they call the Ottendorf cipher,
406.75s - 408.63s |  where there's a whole bunch of numbers
408.63s - 411.19s |  written on the back of the Declaration of Independence
411.19s - 415.03s |  in invisible ink, and that translates to,
415.03s - 419.03s |  if you know the right book, the particular page of a book,
419.03s - 421.23s |  the particular line on the page,
421.23s - 424.07s |  and the particular letter across the line.
425.43s - 427.03s |  That really kind of existed.
427.03s - 430.71s |  That is something that was done in the Revolution.
430.71s - 432.31s |  It was called the Arnold cipher.
434.83s - 437.91s |  Others, examples of transpositions,
437.91s - 441.87s |  and this goes back, I think it's to the ancient Egyptians.
441.87s - 444.83s |  They used to have a stick of a certain size
444.83s - 447.07s |  and wrap a leather strap around it,
447.07s - 450.39s |  write their message, and then unwind it,
450.39s - 452.79s |  and so it was just a bunch of random letters
452.79s - 455.03s |  written out on this big, long strip.
455.03s - 456.67s |  They would send it to the recipient.
457.35s - 459.07s |  He would have to have the same size stick
459.07s - 462.71s |  to wrap it back together again and put it back in order.
462.71s - 465.15s |  Also, something that was used that I learned about
465.15s - 466.67s |  in my early days was something
466.67s - 468.63s |  that's sort of like a crossword puzzle,
468.63s - 470.79s |  but you have a sort of a stencil,
470.79s - 473.11s |  a square with certain holes cut out of it.
473.11s - 476.31s |  You'd write your message in one letter at a time,
476.31s - 478.55s |  rotate it, keep going with your message,
478.55s - 480.11s |  rotate it, and so on and so forth.
480.11s - 483.03s |  When you pull it up, you've got a square
483.03s - 485.15s |  filled with letters in a random order
485.15s - 486.71s |  that hopefully nobody could figure out
486.71s - 488.11s |  how to put it back together.
490.67s - 494.43s |  Another example of something that I learned back in my days
494.43s - 497.19s |  is something called a substitution cipher, a playfair,
497.19s - 499.83s |  where you would put the letters of the alphabet
499.83s - 501.71s |  in a five-by-five square.
502.63s - 504.59s |  Of course, we had 26 letters in the alphabet,
504.59s - 505.59s |  so we had to double up.
505.59s - 507.31s |  Very commonly, it was JK,
507.31s - 509.15s |  but it could have been anything else.
510.07s - 512.07s |  The first ones were just simply A to Z,
512.07s - 514.99s |  but to add a level of complexity,
515.83s - 518.43s |  very often you would start using a keyword.
518.43s - 522.14s |  Did I do that?
522.14s - 528.38s |  Hey, who is this guy?
530.42s - 532.54s |  To add complexity, you'd start with a keyword
532.54s - 534.94s |  and write the letters of that word out in the square,
534.94s - 537.18s |  and then if you used a letter once,
537.18s - 539.94s |  you'd fill in the rest of the square with the alphabet.
539.94s - 542.34s |  And then the way that you would do the encryption
542.34s - 546.42s |  and the decryption was basically create a square
546.42s - 548.58s |  with the letter that you wanted to write
548.58s - 553.26s |  and then make a square and find out what the cipher is,
553.26s - 555.46s |  if that makes sense to you by looking at it.
557.74s - 560.74s |  World War II, Navajo natives
563.18s - 567.78s |  were enlisted to be radio operators and code talkers.
567.78s - 570.62s |  The Japanese, the enemy never broke the code.
570.62s - 573.30s |  They were not only just speaking in their native tongue,
573.30s - 574.94s |  which apparently the Japanese
574.94s - 576.86s |  had a hard time understanding,
576.86s - 581.86s |  but they were using words to mean other things.
582.02s - 584.26s |  So you can see some examples there,
584.26s - 587.66s |  you know, like a battleship was a whale, things like that.
587.66s - 590.18s |  Seems intuitive now that that would have made sense,
590.18s - 591.38s |  but it worked.
593.18s - 597.06s |  Machine encryption started becoming popular in the 30s
597.06s - 599.98s |  and most famously in World War II,
599.98s - 601.90s |  there was the German Enigma machine.
602.66s - 607.46s |  I went to work for the NSA in 1986,
607.46s - 608.90s |  was learning about things like this
608.90s - 611.30s |  and sort of basic courses that we took
611.30s - 613.86s |  to get introduced to the field,
614.98s - 619.02s |  mostly to try to bide our time while our clearances,
619.02s - 621.98s |  our background investigations were being completed.
621.98s - 625.34s |  I learned at that time in 1986
625.34s - 628.98s |  that we weren't telling people
628.98s - 630.70s |  that the Enigma machine had been broken
630.70s - 631.70s |  back in World War II.
632.50s - 633.34s |  That was still a secret.
633.34s - 636.34s |  It wasn't revealed to the public
636.34s - 640.02s |  that the Enigma machine had been broken in World War II,
641.14s - 645.78s |  prior to World War II until I think 1987 or 88.
645.78s - 649.86s |  The reason being there was still somebody out there
649.86s - 651.02s |  that was using it.
652.54s - 657.54s |  It was first broken in 1938 by Polish cryptographers
657.66s - 661.34s |  and used for 50 years after that.
662.02s - 664.10s |  And we kept a secret that we knew how to break it.
664.10s - 666.26s |  I don't think there's anything else that we've ever done
666.26s - 669.62s |  in terms of secrecy that's held up that long.
671.02s - 674.14s |  We being the US, we being NSA types.
675.42s - 679.22s |  Some of the radios and equipment that were being used
679.22s - 681.78s |  when I was there at NSA back in the 80s and 90s,
681.78s - 683.90s |  a lot of these were Vietnam era,
683.90s - 688.18s |  but again, it was about communication security.
688.18s - 689.42s |  When I first went to work
689.42s - 691.50s |  for the defensive side of operations,
691.50s - 694.34s |  it was called ComSec, communication security.
694.34s - 698.06s |  Shortly after that, it was renamed to information security.
698.06s - 699.70s |  So we called it InfoSec.
702.86s - 704.18s |  But some of these radios,
704.18s - 706.74s |  initially they would take an analog signal
706.74s - 709.90s |  and they would apply an encryption algorithm,
709.90s - 712.14s |  usually built into a little black box
712.14s - 714.30s |  because that's what NSA built in those days
714.30s - 716.54s |  with key being applied to it.
716.54s - 718.54s |  So there was encryption involved
718.54s - 720.46s |  and then a receiver on the other end
721.18s - 723.30s |  that could reverse the process.
723.30s - 726.38s |  Later on, there was radios and devices
726.38s - 729.46s |  that would convert the analog signal to digital
729.46s - 731.86s |  and then do the encryption of the digits,
731.86s - 735.30s |  send it and then do the whole process in reverse.
737.26s - 739.10s |  These are just different examples.
740.58s - 744.34s |  One other way to try to defeat the enemy from,
744.34s - 747.46s |  or adversary from intercepting the signal
747.46s - 748.98s |  was not only encrypting it,
748.98s - 751.46s |  but trying to hide it across frequencies.
751.46s - 752.86s |  So send a little bit here,
752.86s - 755.66s |  then using some sort of random algorithm
755.66s - 757.70s |  that was predictable on both sides,
757.70s - 759.54s |  send more and more of the signal
759.54s - 761.74s |  just on different frequencies.
761.74s - 762.98s |  Interestingly enough,
762.98s - 767.98s |  that concept was invented
767.98s - 772.02s |  by Hedy Lamarr, a movie actress from the 1920s.
773.90s - 775.54s |  That's just a shout out to women.
775.54s - 777.38s |  We need more women in industry
777.42s - 781.99s |  because they're smarter than us men very often.
781.99s - 784.55s |  As the systems advanced,
784.55s - 787.55s |  keys needed to be more complex and longer
787.55s - 790.51s |  and keys needed to be changed frequently.
790.51s - 792.95s |  And when you were putting it into a little black box,
792.95s - 795.47s |  you needed to have key machines
795.47s - 797.47s |  that inject the keys.
797.47s - 800.99s |  So these are some examples of key injectors.
802.79s - 805.79s |  This was something that was trying to be popular.
806.79s - 809.71s |  Again, when I was at NSA in the late 80s,
809.71s - 811.79s |  sort of trying to get modern.
811.79s - 814.31s |  So they had a little thing called a KL-43
814.31s - 816.83s |  that had a keyboard and had a little LCD screen
816.83s - 819.55s |  that I think held, you could see 32 digits.
819.55s - 821.99s |  And the idea was you type in a message
821.99s - 824.91s |  and it would immediately be encrypted on the screen.
824.91s - 827.07s |  Usually it would be output to,
828.19s - 830.87s |  gosh, we didn't have thumb drives back then.
830.87s - 832.99s |  It would either be transmitted automatically
832.99s - 835.95s |  or it'd be printed out on paper for distribution.
835.95s - 839.19s |  But the idea was this was high-tech,
839.19s - 842.15s |  self-contained encryption system
842.15s - 843.87s |  rather than a little black box
843.87s - 846.95s |  or a little black inside of a radio or a phone
846.95s - 849.23s |  or a little black box that the radio or phone
849.23s - 850.35s |  was attached to.
853.15s - 856.31s |  Stu-3 telephone was what we were using at the time.
856.31s - 860.15s |  So it was one of the first times that NSA put out
860.23s - 864.91s |  for bid to a contractor an idea of,
864.91s - 866.95s |  NSA came up with the specs,
866.95s - 870.95s |  but different contractors bid on the idea
870.95s - 872.99s |  of how to make a secure phone.
873.95s - 875.51s |  These secure phones were starting
875.51s - 877.51s |  to use public key cryptography
877.51s - 880.59s |  and the keys were seeded with these things
880.59s - 883.19s |  that looked like keys, but you had to stick it in,
883.19s - 886.31s |  turn it, have it, read it and set it up.
886.31s - 889.51s |  And the first ones were half duplex,
889.51s - 891.43s |  which means kind of like a walkie talkie.
891.43s - 894.75s |  It's pushed to talk, one-way communication,
894.75s - 897.63s |  then you let go and then the other person would talk back.
897.63s - 901.79s |  On a telephone, that was often very difficult.
901.79s - 903.67s |  And because of the encryption,
904.83s - 906.47s |  when you used it, you kind of sounded,
906.47s - 909.19s |  the people on the other end kind of sounded like Donald Duck
909.19s - 913.79s |  but it was modern technology at the time.
913.79s - 915.31s |  And eventually they were able to put it
915.31s - 919.51s |  into smartphones, cell phones, so it became more portable.
921.67s - 925.35s |  Very briefly, now we're in the age of digital cryptography,
925.35s - 926.59s |  things have evolved.
928.87s - 931.31s |  We all use cryptography every day
931.31s - 933.43s |  in our lives on the internet.
933.43s - 936.47s |  And there's probably a lot of you guys know this,
936.47s - 939.23s |  but there's basically two forms of encryption.
939.23s - 940.71s |  There's symmetric encryption,
940.71s - 943.51s |  where it's the same key used on either end
943.51s - 945.19s |  of the communication.
945.19s - 947.79s |  And the communication these days are websites
947.79s - 948.99s |  and so on and so forth.
950.43s - 953.59s |  And then the other type, public key cryptography
953.59s - 956.67s |  is the idea of key pairs, where it's a one way,
956.67s - 959.03s |  there's a public and a private key.
959.03s - 962.19s |  I hold my private key and give you my public key.
962.19s - 964.55s |  And I give all of you my public key
964.55s - 966.03s |  because you can encrypt a message
966.03s - 969.51s |  that I can only decrypt with my private key.
969.51s - 971.99s |  But for me to talk back to you,
971.99s - 974.19s |  I've got to get your public key.
974.19s - 976.75s |  And I can write a message and send it to you.
976.75s - 979.67s |  And you're the only one that can decrypt it.
979.67s - 981.71s |  Very simplified view.
981.71s - 984.15s |  There is a third form up in Canada
984.15s - 986.67s |  and it's called symmetric A encryption.
987.75s - 988.59s |  That was a joke.
990.23s - 994.15s |  Whitfield Diffie, he was affiliated with NSA
994.15s - 996.11s |  often on Diffie-Hellman algorithm,
996.11s - 999.07s |  actually took a course with him early on at NSA.
999.11s - 1002.19s |  So I kind of threw his picture up there.
1002.19s - 1003.47s |  And then you got the modern age
1003.47s - 1005.71s |  and all the fun stuff coming like with quantum.
1005.71s - 1008.55s |  I don't wanna say that much about quantum cryptography.
1009.51s - 1011.07s |  The other big thing that's popular,
1011.07s - 1012.39s |  I just saw it earlier in the week.
1012.39s - 1014.51s |  I was down at that other conference
1014.51s - 1016.23s |  that we don't mention around here.
1016.23s - 1018.51s |  But the idea of homomorphic encryption,
1018.51s - 1020.15s |  which really rubs me the wrong way
1020.15s - 1021.99s |  because I spent my entire career
1021.99s - 1023.55s |  and learned about all the different ways
1023.55s - 1026.79s |  that we protect data, protect data, encrypt data.
1026.83s - 1029.75s |  With the idea that we're keeping things a secret,
1029.75s - 1032.19s |  but people are coming up with ways
1032.19s - 1034.47s |  of being able to encrypt data,
1034.47s - 1037.47s |  but still get meaningful information out of it.
1037.47s - 1039.95s |  I don't get my head wrapped around that very well.
1039.95s - 1043.39s |  I kind of think that, okay, it's neat technology.
1043.39s - 1044.79s |  It's a neat idea.
1044.79s - 1046.67s |  Just don't call it encryption,
1046.67s - 1050.15s |  but I'm losing that battle as many other battles.
1051.43s - 1054.49s |  Just in terms of why I kind of put this talk together,
1055.21s - 1057.21s |  several months ago,
1057.21s - 1059.73s |  I do a podcast called Paul's Security Weekly.
1059.73s - 1061.77s |  And gosh, it was probably a year ago.
1061.77s - 1066.01s |  We were talking to somebody and somebody in the chat,
1066.01s - 1067.93s |  when we used to broadcast live,
1067.93s - 1070.49s |  was saying something about encryption and encoding.
1070.49s - 1072.41s |  And I'm like, you know, those are two different things.
1072.41s - 1074.05s |  And he's like, well, no, they're interchangeable.
1074.05s - 1077.89s |  So I like went out to Google the meaning of the words.
1077.89s - 1082.89s |  And I found on Wikipedia, the definition here,
1083.53s - 1084.81s |  and I'm reading through it.
1084.81s - 1088.19s |  And I'm gonna have to stick to my laptop here for a minute.
1089.53s - 1091.21s |  It says, well, you can read it,
1091.21s - 1095.03s |  but it uses encryption saying it's the process of encoding.
1095.03s - 1100.03s |  And later on, it talks about ciphertext, plain text.
1101.49s - 1104.53s |  But this has always been kind of a beef with me
1104.53s - 1107.01s |  because there's codes and there's ciphers.
1107.01s - 1109.69s |  And encoding is something you do with code.
1109.69s - 1112.13s |  And then ciphering is something you do with ciphers.
1112.17s - 1114.05s |  They're two different things,
1114.05s - 1116.41s |  but they're very often used interchangeably,
1117.29s - 1119.85s |  which bothers me because I'm a purist.
1119.85s - 1122.61s |  Another thing I found was another definition.
1122.61s - 1125.17s |  And they talked, oops, sorry.
1125.17s - 1128.45s |  They talked about secret codes
1128.45s - 1130.73s |  and there's talking about coding and decoding.
1130.73s - 1132.81s |  And that's how you get ciphers.
1132.81s - 1134.51s |  That's not technically accurate.
1136.41s - 1138.37s |  If you remember, I shared this earlier.
1138.81s - 1143.81s |  This is sort of the summary of what codes and ciphers are.
1143.81s - 1145.49s |  And I kind of wanted to set out
1145.49s - 1147.65s |  and try to give some information
1147.65s - 1150.53s |  about why I say these words are wrong.
1150.53s - 1153.05s |  And the CFP that I submitted,
1153.05s - 1156.09s |  they gave me feedback that this was sounding subjective
1156.09s - 1158.47s |  and opinion-based, but it's actually not.
1159.53s - 1162.41s |  I have sort of the Bibles of cryptography.
1162.41s - 1164.53s |  They're declassified at some point.
1164.53s - 1166.13s |  I was allowed to keep my copies
1166.13s - 1170.49s |  of military cryptanalytics volumes one and two
1170.49s - 1173.61s |  or part one and two written by gentlemen
1173.61s - 1176.05s |  that were very highly respected cryptographers
1176.05s - 1178.81s |  before World War II sort of became the pioneers
1178.81s - 1183.81s |  in the formation of NSA, Lambros Kalimahos.
1183.89s - 1186.65s |  And if you guys have gone to the village
1186.65s - 1188.77s |  and you've heard about the Goldbug Award,
1188.77s - 1192.49s |  there's also a society at NSA of cryptographers
1192.49s - 1194.09s |  called the Dundee Society.
1194.65s - 1196.85s |  You can see the explanation of it there.
1196.85s - 1200.13s |  But then also the other author was William Friedman.
1200.13s - 1201.05s |  Thank you.
1201.05s - 1204.85s |  Between he and his wife, Elizabeth Friedman,
1204.85s - 1206.49s |  they were sort of responsible.
1206.49s - 1208.41s |  They're sort of considered the godfather,
1208.41s - 1210.89s |  the godmother of cryptography.
1210.89s - 1212.01s |  So these are the authors.
1212.01s - 1213.77s |  These guys were the ones breaking the codes
1213.77s - 1215.71s |  and ciphers back in World War II.
1216.69s - 1220.45s |  So very quickly, the definitions that they wrote
1220.45s - 1223.97s |  that are written down are such,
1223.97s - 1226.29s |  and hopefully you can see it on the screen there.
1226.29s - 1229.13s |  I just wanna highlight a couple things here
1229.13s - 1231.69s |  where, again, it's in writing.
1231.69s - 1235.37s |  Ciphers have to do with individual letters.
1235.37s - 1236.93s |  I say characters.
1236.93s - 1242.38s |  And then the codes have to do with words and phrases.
1242.38s - 1244.62s |  Oh, this is something I picked up.
1244.62s - 1247.22s |  I was preparing for this this morning
1247.22s - 1249.28s |  and I thought this was kind of interesting.
1249.28s - 1251.10s |  I hadn't noticed it before.
1251.10s - 1253.90s |  But there's a statement there that simply says
1253.90s - 1255.86s |  you do these things, you encrypt things
1255.86s - 1259.38s |  and create cryptograms for one of two reasons,
1259.38s - 1262.66s |  secrecy and economy or brevity.
1262.66s - 1263.90s |  And I thought that was interesting
1263.90s - 1266.54s |  because the way I was learning code and cipher,
1266.54s - 1269.30s |  especially when we're starting to get into computers
1269.30s - 1272.14s |  and internet technology,
1272.14s - 1275.90s |  encoding was always considered a way to shrink down,
1275.90s - 1278.50s |  compress the data so it could be sent quicker
1278.50s - 1279.98s |  and more easily.
1279.98s - 1283.22s |  And we never presumed that it was secure.
1283.22s - 1285.82s |  That's what the encryption was for.
1285.82s - 1289.78s |  So brevity or speed, coding,
1291.38s - 1294.66s |  secrecy, protection of what you're trying to transmit,
1294.66s - 1295.50s |  cipher.
1297.66s - 1301.14s |  And then finally, just a brief mention here again,
1301.14s - 1303.98s |  where they talk about the introduction of key.
1303.98s - 1307.54s |  And we know key now most commonly as certificates.
1307.54s - 1310.90s |  The key was really any method that was used
1310.90s - 1313.06s |  and agreed upon by both sides
1314.46s - 1318.50s |  as how you were gonna do the encryption, the protection.
1318.50s - 1321.98s |  Nowadays, it's mostly just throwing huge random streams
1321.98s - 1324.02s |  that hopefully nobody can figure out
1324.02s - 1326.12s |  and giving the random streams to both ends
1326.12s - 1329.30s |  to go through a very complex mathematical algorithm.
1329.30s - 1331.10s |  That's where we are today.
1331.10s - 1333.76s |  But just to summarize in terms of
1333.76s - 1335.46s |  why I think words have meanings
1335.46s - 1337.14s |  and why I think we need to understand
1337.14s - 1338.30s |  the meanings of the words,
1338.30s - 1341.32s |  even in our modern digital context
1341.32s - 1344.60s |  is going back to the fundamentals of where they came from,
1344.60s - 1345.86s |  codes and ciphers.
1345.86s - 1348.10s |  And I would suggest to you that again,
1348.10s - 1350.66s |  think about codes or encoding
1350.66s - 1354.58s |  as just a way to compress and increase speed,
1354.58s - 1356.90s |  not necessarily security.
1356.90s - 1358.82s |  That's where the cipher and the encryption
1358.82s - 1361.02s |  and the big long key streams come in.
1361.46s - 1368.03s |  Real briefly, it's all about protection of data,
1368.39s - 1370.07s |  information, keeping secrets.
1370.07s - 1372.31s |  You probably know about the idea of confidentiality,
1372.31s - 1374.35s |  integrity and availability,
1374.35s - 1379.27s |  and then digital age introduced things like non repudiation.
1379.27s - 1382.27s |  We spent most of our time in the digital age
1382.27s - 1384.59s |  focusing on the confidentiality.
1384.59s - 1386.03s |  Nowadays, we're trying to figure out
1386.03s - 1387.75s |  how to do the availability
1387.75s - 1391.27s |  because of all the ransomware attacks that are out there.
1391.27s - 1393.75s |  One last thing, that cipher wheel I mentioned,
1394.67s - 1397.99s |  it was put on display at the National Cryptologic Museum
1397.99s - 1400.79s |  near Fort Meade, Maryland back in April.
1400.79s - 1404.15s |  And it's on display through September.
1404.15s - 1407.43s |  If you make it to Maryland, it's in a display case.
1407.43s - 1411.15s |  There I am looking at it and there's the display.
1411.15s - 1413.43s |  If you could probably not read it there,
1413.43s - 1416.23s |  but it says Jeff Mann reinvents the wheel.
1417.31s - 1418.47s |  So thank you very much.
