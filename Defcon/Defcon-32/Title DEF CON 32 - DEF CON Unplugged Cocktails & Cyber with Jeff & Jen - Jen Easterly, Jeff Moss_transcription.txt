0.62s - 8.55s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 I'm transitioning from my central nervous system stimulant.
8.55s - 15.75s |  Jen's going to flex her skills in mixology and create some central nervous system depressants
15.75s - 19.47s |  that we're then going to consume and have a great conversation.
19.47s - 25.51s |  And then we are definitely going to open it up to ask Jen anything or ask me anything.
25.51s - 28.95s |  We'll go to an AMA style format after we talk for a little bit.
28.95s - 34.43s |  So we've got a microphone here.
34.43s - 37.79s |  Please ask a question.
37.79s - 40.09s |  This is not a statement in the form of a question.
40.09s - 41.79s |  It's a question.
41.79s - 44.43s |  And then we'll discuss the question.
44.43s - 47.89s |  So just please use this microphone if you can.
47.89s - 50.39s |  It's harder to see if there's another one.
50.39s - 51.51s |  Great.
51.51s - 52.55s |  So that's what we're going to do.
52.55s - 53.55s |  That's the plan.
53.55s - 55.55s |  Thanks for coming.
55.55s - 61.95s |  Jen's a multiple time DEF CON veteran.
61.95s - 62.95s |  And it's fascinating.
62.95s - 71.07s |  I always love, so disclaimer, I'm, Jen's my director.
71.07s - 74.11s |  I'm on the advisory council she set up at CISA.
74.11s - 78.27s |  So normally when I interact with Jen, it's much more formal.
78.27s - 82.95s |  We're delivering reports, technical advisory recommendations to her.
82.95s - 88.95s |  Her staff, CISA, determines whether to accept our recommendations, reject them, modify them.
88.95s - 96.67s |  And so outside of that dynamic, it's fantastic for her to make a drink for me.
96.67s - 97.67s |  So thank you.
97.67s - 98.67s |  Do you want me to?
98.67s - 101.24s |  Yeah.
101.24s - 104.64s |  Why don't you tell us what you're doing?
104.64s - 107.34s |  Oh.
107.34s - 108.34s |  Yeah.
108.34s - 109.34s |  What's going on here?
109.34s - 110.34s |  So, hey, everybody.
110.34s - 111.34s |  My name's Jen.
112.06s - 117.66s |  So this is the, it should have been the fourth time, but that 2021 was a COVID year.
117.66s - 121.74s |  This is my third time at DEF CON.
121.74s - 125.22s |  And this is my favorite con of the year.
125.22s - 126.22s |  My favorite thing to do.
126.22s - 129.82s |  I look forward to it every single year.
129.82s - 135.94s |  And last year, I was not, it was my second time, but I was with two newbies.
135.94s - 138.06s |  And so they had to do shots.
138.06s - 139.62s |  So I, you know, in solidarity.
139.62s - 142.82s |  But I said, this year, like, Jeff, what do you want to do?
142.82s - 143.82s |  And he's like, well, I don't know.
143.82s - 144.82s |  What do you want to do?
144.82s - 150.74s |  And I said, well, let's just, let's just have some cocktails and cyber talk and hear from
150.74s - 151.74s |  my friends.
151.74s - 152.74s |  Yeah.
152.74s - 153.74s |  See where it goes.
153.74s - 154.74s |  Yeah.
154.74s - 163.42s |  So before I took this job, I chatted with Jeff and I said, hey, Jeff, what's your best
163.42s - 168.06s |  advice to be successful as the director of CISA?
168.14s - 169.94s |  And it was great advice.
169.94s - 180.10s |  It wasn't like shockingly, you know, surprising advice, but it has really stayed with me since
180.10s - 181.10s |  I took this job.
181.10s - 187.10s |  And it was like, be a part of the community, you know, really like be a part of the community
187.10s - 188.90s |  because it's an amazing community.
188.90s - 192.66s |  And you know, CISA is not an intel agency.
192.66s - 194.30s |  We're not a law enforcement agency.
194.30s - 196.26s |  We're not a regulator.
196.26s - 202.06s |  Everything we do is by, with and through partners and our success is predicated on our ability
202.06s - 207.82s |  to catalyze trusted partnerships, whether it's with industry, with the research community,
207.82s - 211.42s |  with the hacker community, across the federal government, with the state and local community,
211.42s - 213.06s |  with election officials.
213.06s - 219.58s |  It's all about how do you build trusted partnerships and people don't trust institutions.
219.58s - 221.34s |  They trust people.
221.34s - 228.46s |  And so I like to get out and spend time with all of our partners so that they understand
228.46s - 234.14s |  who I am, who my team is, what we do, the value that we bring, and how we can help support
234.14s - 238.26s |  others and serve others and ultimately help the American people.
238.26s - 239.26s |  So I'm excited.
239.26s - 245.66s |  We're going to chat a little bit, but we really did just want to open this up as an ask us
245.66s - 248.42s |  anything, AUA, I guess.
248.42s - 254.54s |  You can ask all the hard questions to Jeff and I'll take all the easy ones, but I do
254.54s - 260.78s |  want to thank my friend Jeff, who has been a fabulous partner throughout my three plus
260.78s - 266.54s |  years in this job and for your service as well as the head of our technical advisory
266.54s - 271.22s |  council and really important work throughout the last three years.
271.22s - 273.06s |  So super grateful for that.
273.50s - 281.06s |  You're one of the first people that actually listened to my advice and really actually
281.06s - 286.10s |  visibly did some of the hard work to actually engage.
286.10s - 290.06s |  Building community is not easy and it sometimes fails.
290.06s - 295.74s |  And so I appreciate you calling that out because CISA's got some interesting things.
295.74s - 298.82s |  You can convene people.
298.82s - 301.06s |  You can try to regulate people.
301.06s - 302.06s |  You can-
302.06s - 303.06s |  Nope.
303.06s - 309.30s |  Well, in some critical infrastructure areas, you could, you know, not chemical.
309.30s - 313.14s |  Well, no, we lost those authorities, unfortunately.
313.14s - 314.98s |  They lost the authorities.
314.98s - 315.98s |  Yeah.
315.98s - 320.70s |  We're going to have to drink to that.
320.70s - 327.78s |  And so there's essentially the areas where you can be a convener or you can be a coordinator,
327.78s - 328.78s |  right?
328.78s - 330.82s |  A lot of sector coordination.
330.82s - 335.58s |  And so knowing what hat you're wearing and when and which is appropriate.
335.58s - 339.66s |  And I really love that you used that phrase, people trust individuals, not institutions.
339.66s - 345.58s |  That was one of the first lessons I learned at ICANN when I was back there was that nobody
345.58s - 348.42s |  is going to- everything's built on individual trust.
348.42s - 351.74s |  They're not going to reveal the secret to the random organization.
351.74s - 355.30s |  They're going to reveal it to their friend that they trust in the organization, which
355.30s - 358.94s |  then means you have to have people that are willing to put in the time to travel and not
358.94s - 360.72s |  turn over every year.
360.72s - 365.40s |  And so one of my pieces of advice was, Jen, is like, find some non-political appointees.
365.40s - 369.60s |  People will be there for a long time, some full-time employees, and they will be your
369.60s - 374.28s |  like avatars out in the community that people can build trust with and make sure you're
374.28s - 378.76s |  committing enough budget that they can show up in enough places over time that those relationships
378.76s - 381.44s |  build and you have a way of mentoring the next.
381.44s - 383.68s |  And she did it, which is awesome.
383.68s - 386.00s |  Okay, we're not doing an orange.
386.00s - 387.00s |  What the orange one?
387.00s - 388.00s |  Not the orange one.
388.00s - 389.00s |  Oh, okay.
389.00s - 390.00s |  Let's start out.
390.28s - 392.28s |  Okay, so tell us what you've done here.
392.28s - 394.28s |  Okay, we had a little bitters.
394.28s - 397.40s |  We had a little sugar cube that's partially melted.
397.40s - 400.12s |  We have a little maker's mark.
400.12s - 403.96s |  Didn't have a lot of success with the orange, but I do have some maraschino cherries.
403.96s - 405.84s |  Yeah, yeah.
405.84s - 406.84s |  It's my favorite.
406.84s - 409.36s |  So I don't see the cherry in here.
409.36s - 410.36s |  I didn't- okay.
410.36s - 411.36s |  All right.
411.36s - 412.36s |  All right.
412.36s - 413.36s |  I want the full meal deal.
413.36s - 414.36s |  All right, all right.
414.36s - 415.36s |  If it's on the table.
415.36s - 416.36s |  Okay.
416.36s - 417.36s |  All right.
417.36s - 418.36s |  All right.
418.36s - 419.36s |  As long as you're having one, right?
419.72s - 420.72s |  Yeah.
420.72s - 421.72s |  Good.
421.72s - 423.72s |  We have to have a parity, you know, a public-private partnership here.
423.72s - 424.72s |  Yeah, exactly.
424.72s - 425.72s |  Exactly.
425.72s - 426.72s |  All right.
426.72s - 427.72s |  There you go, brother.
427.72s - 428.72s |  Excellent.
428.72s - 431.19s |  Thank you.
431.19s - 434.19s |  I don't want to know how many government regulations we're violating.
434.19s - 435.19s |  None.
435.19s - 436.19s |  Right now.
436.19s - 437.19s |  I've had all of this approved.
437.19s - 441.19s |  You've had it all approved by the OGE lawyer.
441.19s - 442.19s |  Yes.
442.19s - 443.19s |  Okay.
443.19s - 452.08s |  So while you're mixing, maybe you can be thinking about like over the last three years now that
452.64s - 457.64s |  you've been building this community, maybe tell us what you think of when you see a community
457.64s - 463.64s |  like DEF CON and we want to get engaged, people want to help, they don't know how to help,
463.64s - 467.76s |  they're not very many good on-ramps to helping, and they don't even know if they have the
467.76s - 469.68s |  right skills that are needed.
469.68s - 472.68s |  And then on the other hand, you've got government doing the same thing.
472.68s - 477.04s |  They see this pool of talented people, but they don't necessarily know how to approach
477.04s - 478.04s |  them.
478.04s - 479.76s |  They don't know what to ask of them.
480.48s - 487.16s |  How have you puzzled through that, or is it like an ongoing mix and match, or I'll use
487.16s - 492.28s |  your term, Rubik's cube solve, trying to get everything on the right color on the right
492.28s - 493.28s |  side?
493.28s - 494.28s |  Yeah.
494.28s - 501.88s |  So we have tried really, really hard to be an agency that is not a lumbering government
501.88s - 502.88s |  bureaucracy.
502.88s - 503.88s |  Right?
503.88s - 511.20s |  And yeah, I mean, again, like I was in the government for 27 years.
511.20s - 513.08s |  I was in the army for most of that time.
513.08s - 518.24s |  I was the National Security Agency, I was in the White House a couple times doing policy.
518.24s - 521.44s |  And then I left to go to the private sector.
521.44s - 524.80s |  I was at Morgan Stanley for four and a half years.
524.80s - 529.84s |  And it was like a very liberating feel, frankly, to leave the federal government and go to
529.84s - 531.88s |  the private sector.
531.88s - 539.96s |  And when I looked back from the private sector to the federal government, I'm like, oh, oh,
539.96s - 540.96s |  that's really hard to understand.
540.96s - 542.20s |  Like a reverse culture shock?
542.20s - 543.20s |  Yeah, it was.
543.20s - 544.28s |  It really was.
544.28s - 550.88s |  And when I came back, I was very determined to ensure that this agency, which was then
550.88s - 559.36s |  the newest agency in the federal government, that we were going to add value, not friction.
559.36s - 564.96s |  That we were going to be accessible, that we were going to be transparent, that we were
564.96s - 567.40s |  going to be responsive.
567.40s - 572.76s |  And it sounds like obvious, but it's not that, you know, it's not an easy thing.
572.76s - 577.20s |  And so we really just wanted to build a very different culture from your typical government
577.20s - 578.52s |  agency.
578.52s - 582.20s |  And a lot of that is being accessible to the community.
582.20s - 586.92s |  So that's sort of the first thing, because, you know, if you only show up once a year,
586.92s - 591.28s |  if you only, you know, I mean, people know you're not authentic about it.
591.28s - 594.28s |  And so you have to be part of the community.
594.28s - 596.56s |  And when you're part of the community, you're going to take some lumps.
596.56s - 597.56s |  Yeah.
597.56s - 599.84s |  Well, dude, I've taken a lot of lumps in my life.
599.84s - 603.28s |  So that's not it's not a problem for me.
603.28s - 606.00s |  But you know, I do treat feedback as a gift.
606.00s - 607.00s |  I really do.
607.00s - 611.80s |  Like, I don't really I don't really appreciate people who are assholes.
611.80s - 612.80s |  I get it.
612.80s - 618.60s |  You know, but if but I really appreciate Frank, you know, positive, critical feedback.
618.60s - 622.92s |  That's like given a constructive, constructive feedback given in good faith.
622.92s - 623.92s |  Yeah.
623.92s - 624.92s |  Good faith.
624.92s - 625.92s |  Feedback is always.
625.92s - 626.92s |  Yeah.
626.92s - 628.48s |  I mean, you know, if you want to be a dick, that's fine.
628.48s - 630.36s |  But like, I don't really have time for you.
630.36s - 631.36s |  Right.
631.36s - 632.36s |  Right.
632.36s - 637.60s |  And so if as long as it's coming from a good place, half the questions, they just don't
637.60s - 639.56s |  know it's already been answered.
639.56s - 642.04s |  So it's just a lot of trying to orient people.
642.48s - 643.48s |  Totally.
643.48s - 644.76s |  So then.
644.76s - 648.76s |  So maybe in the last since you first started showing up at DEF CON, have there been good
648.76s - 653.80s |  examples or any exchanges of things that worked out the way you thought or didn't work out
653.80s - 655.72s |  like that's enough time to.
655.72s - 656.72s |  Yeah.
656.72s - 659.32s |  I mean, I will tell you, it's funny.
659.32s - 664.56s |  The first experience I had with DEF CON, I wasn't actually here.
664.56s - 669.12s |  It was it was when I was working at the National Security Agency in 2013.
669.12s - 670.12s |  Oh, do tell.
670.12s - 671.12s |  Remember?
671.88s - 677.52s |  And it was I was working counterterrorism and it was the year of Snowden.
677.52s - 682.48s |  And my boss at the time, Keith Alexander, wanted to come to Vegas.
682.48s - 686.64s |  I think you probably chatted with him about that.
686.64s - 691.92s |  And I didn't come with them then, but I was one of the staffers who sort of helped help
691.92s - 694.40s |  prepare remarks for that.
694.40s - 699.60s |  And I think the you know, I think the vibe is very, very different from those days.
699.60s - 700.60s |  Right.
701.08s - 702.76s |  I hate I hate the term Fed.
702.76s - 704.12s |  I just have to say that.
704.12s - 707.28s |  But it's like the federal is.
707.28s - 710.16s |  But I I think it's come a long way.
710.16s - 713.56s |  And I mean, people have been so gracious, so kind.
713.56s - 714.80s |  So it's been fantastic.
714.80s - 720.84s |  That's why I love this community, because everybody here, I think, shares the desire
720.84s - 727.04s |  to actually do good, to fix things, to help.
727.04s - 730.72s |  And that's what we need, because frankly, our job is to protect and defend the critical
730.72s - 734.56s |  infrastructure that Americans rely on every hour of every day.
734.56s - 739.96s |  And the vast majority of that infrastructure is owned and operated by other people.
739.96s - 747.32s |  And so if we do not catalyze a community approach to driving down risk to our technology ecosystem,
747.32s - 748.80s |  we won't be successful.
748.80s - 749.80s |  Right.
749.80s - 750.80s |  Yeah.
750.80s - 755.72s |  Do you think that's maybe an advantage in the in the U.S. model?
755.72s - 760.68s |  I mean, not every country has so much critical infrastructure owned and operated by a private
760.68s - 762.60s |  entity.
762.60s - 768.76s |  And so maybe it's a secret benefit I hadn't even really considered.
768.76s - 773.36s |  Because as long as you can orient the owner operators to do the right thing, they're not
773.36s - 777.16s |  just waiting in a passive mode for top down command and control, telling them to patch
777.16s - 778.68s |  this or do that.
778.68s - 779.68s |  Right.
779.68s - 782.12s |  There's enough independent autonomy or maybe diversity.
782.12s - 785.64s |  Well, there's definitely diversity.
786.56s - 788.32s |  I mean, you could say diversity equals resilience.
788.32s - 793.56s |  But I gave a talk yesterday at Black Hat, and, you know, since I've been in this job
793.56s - 797.68s |  now three plus years, we're trying to figure out, you know, when I came in, ransomware
797.68s - 798.92s |  is a problem.
798.92s - 802.72s |  Three plus years later, ransomware is still a big problem.
802.72s - 808.80s |  You know, I think the really important progress that we have made with the community, I think
808.80s - 814.88s |  we have been able to catalyze real collaboration between the federal government, state and
814.88s - 821.80s |  local industry, hacker community, academia, I mean, all kinds of partners.
821.80s - 824.60s |  We've been able to build good collaboration.
824.60s - 833.64s |  Second, I think CEOs and boards and business leaders are increasingly seeing cyber risk
833.64s - 834.92s |  as a core business risk.
834.92s - 836.32s |  I think that's really good.
836.32s - 841.56s |  I think there is greater awareness of the importance of basic cyber hygiene.
841.56s - 843.96s |  You know, we have the Secure Our World campaign.
844.04s - 845.24s |  Those are the four things to do.
845.24s - 848.28s |  And so, you know, we've been working on that.
848.28s - 854.80s |  I love efforts like Craig Newmark's Cyber Civil Defense, really bringing together the
854.80s - 859.84s |  community and we help with some of the cyber clinics, and that's really great.
859.84s - 866.80s |  But I think at the end of the day, unless we stop talking about the villains, right,
866.80s - 871.56s |  and the victims and start demanding more of the vendors, I don't think we're going to
871.56s - 877.64s |  get into a place where we're going to be able to drive down risk as much as we really
877.64s - 878.64s |  want to.
878.64s - 881.80s |  I mean, at the end of the day, we have, you know, Jeff and I were talking earlier, like
881.80s - 887.36s |  we should stop calling things vulnerabilities because it really diffuses responsibility.
887.36s - 895.96s |  We should start calling them product defects because that names it much more clearly, right?
895.96s - 897.44s |  And that's what they are.
897.44s - 902.12s |  And at the end of the day, it also highlights how important it is for tech manufacturers
902.12s - 910.24s |  to design and develop and test and deploy software specifically focused on driving down
910.24s - 913.84s |  dramatically the number of exploitable defects.
913.84s - 917.72s |  And when you use the common language that's used in other industries, everybody else kind
917.72s - 918.72s |  of gets it.
918.72s - 919.72s |  Oh, a defect.
919.72s - 920.72s |  Oh, we track defects.
920.72s - 921.72s |  We study defects.
921.72s - 922.72s |  We do these things.
923.00s - 927.92s |  It goes away from being mysterious so we can't protect ourselves.
927.92s - 928.92s |  It's a vulnerability.
928.92s - 929.92s |  Yeah.
929.92s - 931.32s |  I mean, a hundred percent.
931.32s - 936.24s |  We should be learning from what other industries possess that like inexplicably.
936.24s - 937.24s |  Oh, wait.
937.24s - 939.64s |  Did you sip out of your glass without clinking?
939.64s - 940.64s |  I did.
940.64s - 941.64s |  I was testing it.
941.64s - 942.64s |  Oh, okay.
942.64s - 943.64s |  I was testing it.
943.64s - 944.64s |  Okay.
944.64s - 945.64s |  That was an alpha test.
945.64s - 946.64s |  It's drinkable.
946.64s - 947.64s |  We're going to go to deployment.
947.64s - 948.64s |  Okay.
948.64s - 949.64s |  We're deploying.
949.64s - 950.64s |  Push to production.
950.64s - 955.26s |  Okay.
955.26s - 956.26s |  Here we go.
957.18s - 958.18s |  Sweet.
958.18s - 959.18s |  Yeah.
959.18s - 960.18s |  I'm sorry.
960.18s - 963.18s |  I interrupted your flow there.
963.18s - 965.18s |  I totally forgot what I was saying.
965.18s - 966.18s |  So.
966.18s - 967.18s |  Oh, you know what I was saying?
967.18s - 971.86s |  I think we can learn a lot from what other industries possess that the world of software
971.86s - 972.86s |  doesn't.
972.86s - 973.86s |  Right?
973.86s - 978.06s |  I mean, the vast majority of other industries, they do track defects and incidents that cause
978.06s - 982.14s |  harm so that you can specifically focus on reducing risk.
982.14s - 984.78s |  The risk to driving on the highway, the risk to getting on an airplane.
985.30s - 990.38s |  I mean, other industries are frankly obsessed with continuous improvement.
990.38s - 995.10s |  The thing that I find so mind boggling about this, as an outsider, not an engineer, is
995.10s - 1001.62s |  that think about all the safety engineering done around airplanes, space, water, any kind
1001.62s - 1004.14s |  of large civil engineering infrastructure.
1004.14s - 1006.14s |  They're held to these ridiculous standards.
1006.14s - 1008.34s |  Everybody is certified, whatever.
1008.34s - 1012.62s |  And then you take that and you're like, okay, that's what we do when it's like engineering
1012.66s - 1014.86s |  versus nature.
1014.86s - 1015.86s |  We have all these.
1015.86s - 1019.98s |  Now it's engineering versus nature plus adversaries.
1019.98s - 1025.10s |  So what we'll do is we're going to do less than we would have done if it was engineering
1025.10s - 1026.18s |  versus nature.
1026.18s - 1027.46s |  It doesn't make any sense.
1027.46s - 1028.46s |  No.
1028.46s - 1029.46s |  I'm with you, brother.
1029.46s - 1030.46s |  Is anyone here from MITRE?
1030.46s - 1031.46s |  We've got MITRE people.
1031.46s - 1034.10s |  I was talking about this yesterday.
1034.10s - 1041.30s |  So MITRE in 2007 published this white paper called Unforgivable Vulnerabilities.
1041.30s - 1046.70s |  And it laid out criteria for classes of defect that would be considered unforgivable for
1046.70s - 1049.54s |  being both easily found and easily exploited.
1049.54s - 1055.26s |  So products that didn't keep security, have security in mind at all.
1055.26s - 1059.76s |  And folks in here can probably guess what was on the list, but it was memory safety
1059.76s - 1065.66s |  violations and coding weaknesses leading to cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and directory
1065.66s - 1067.26s |  traversal.
1067.26s - 1075.14s |  So then 2023, 16 years later, MITRE publishes another paper called Stubborn Weaknesses.
1075.14s - 1077.38s |  And what do you think was at the top of the list?
1077.38s - 1078.38s |  Yeah.
1078.38s - 1084.02s |  Memory safety violations and coding weaknesses leading to cross-site scripting, SQL injection,
1084.02s - 1085.02s |  and directory traversal.
1085.02s - 1087.50s |  They just named it version two of their original document.
1087.50s - 1088.50s |  Yeah.
1088.50s - 1092.82s |  I mean, they weren't as egregious as the ones in 2007, but many of them were.
1092.82s - 1095.70s |  And so again, like this has to be a community thing.
1095.70s - 1100.62s |  We all have to play a role, both from the supply side, but as well as the demand side.
1100.62s - 1105.98s |  I mean, all of us need to be demanding safer and more secure products and realizing that
1105.98s - 1107.22s |  we have purchasing power.
1107.22s - 1108.22s |  Right.
1108.22s - 1109.22s |  So, right.
1109.22s - 1111.34s |  So I think there's...
1111.34s - 1112.34s |  If you just...
1112.34s - 1113.34s |  You're not going to drink your drink.
1113.34s - 1114.34s |  You don't like your drink.
1114.34s - 1115.34s |  I'm drinking the drink.
1115.34s - 1116.34s |  I'm drinking the drink.
1116.34s - 1117.34s |  No, I'm not forcing you.
1117.34s - 1118.34s |  Look how much I've got.
1118.34s - 1119.34s |  Let's compare our drinks.
1119.34s - 1122.95s |  I drank enough.
1122.95s - 1129.63s |  So I think part of it is you have to recognize who's most responsible in any given situation.
1129.63s - 1134.23s |  If it's a coding error, the people closest to the project probably bear the greatest
1134.23s - 1135.87s |  responsibility in fixing it.
1135.87s - 1136.87s |  Right.
1136.87s - 1140.55s |  They're near the lever, the steering wheel, whatever, where they can make the change.
1140.55s - 1144.83s |  Every step away from that, there's fewer and fewer things you can do.
1144.83s - 1147.99s |  Like, oh no, now I've got to wrap a firewall around it.
1147.99s - 1150.83s |  Now I have to wrap a monitoring system around it.
1150.91s - 1154.27s |  But the closer you get to fixing the core problem, you maybe don't have to deploy all
1154.27s - 1157.51s |  those other mitigations.
1157.51s - 1161.27s |  So my whole thing is the manufacturer or the person closest to the problem has the most
1161.27s - 1168.59s |  responsibility, comma, we should ask for better products, comma, the government should regulate
1168.59s - 1174.87s |  better labeling, better disclosures, better help inform the public debate, comma, we should
1174.87s - 1178.07s |  demand better of our partner nations.
1178.07s - 1183.35s |  There's a thing at each step, and no one trumps the other, but, you know.
1183.35s - 1185.47s |  Yeah, I mean, it's a community thing.
1185.47s - 1191.15s |  One of the things that we are having discussions around, or it's a software liability regime.
1191.15s - 1196.31s |  And so one that has an articulable standard of care, but also safe harbor provisions for
1196.31s - 1201.35s |  vendors that do innovate responsibly using secure development processes.
1201.35s - 1206.79s |  So the liability stuff, right, we've been complaining about that forever.
1206.79s - 1210.59s |  But there's so many, right, there's so many ways you could do liability.
1210.59s - 1214.75s |  You could say, you're an open source software project, your source is free.
1214.75s - 1218.39s |  No liability for you, because you can self protect.
1218.39s - 1223.03s |  Oh, you're a closed commercial product, and you've end of lifed your product.
1223.03s - 1225.79s |  And it's, you don't ever plan to do anything with it.
1225.79s - 1226.79s |  You still have liability.
1226.79s - 1230.83s |  But if you open source it, no liability, you know, there's so many nuances and ways to
1230.83s - 1231.83s |  approach it.
1231.83s - 1236.47s |  And I feel like the liability discussion is always like, all or nothing.
1237.15s - 1239.79s |  I'm saying that's like one of the levers to pull, right?
1239.79s - 1245.99s |  I mean, if you, if you just think about, if two thirds of software vulnerabilities are
1245.99s - 1248.47s |  memory safety, right?
1248.47s - 1254.83s |  Memory safety, then there is a lot that can be done across the ecosystem, quite frankly.
1254.83s - 1259.91s |  But you know, the yes, the technology vendor plays a significant role, but also, you know,
1259.91s - 1261.31s |  higher education.
1261.31s - 1264.03s |  That's why we're having discussions with that, right?
1264.03s - 1265.03s |  Right.
1265.07s - 1268.59s |  Yeah, I think there's, and it's interesting, because when I put on my government thinking
1268.59s - 1273.75s |  hat, you look at a problem, and you're like, okay, is this a problem that's uniquely a
1273.75s - 1278.67s |  governmental question, a tragedy, the commons issue, there's no market force, the incentive
1278.67s - 1281.79s |  models don't work to fix it.
1281.79s - 1286.75s |  So in that case, traditionally, that's why we form governments to help us in these areas
1286.75s - 1289.71s |  where normal forces don't work.
1289.71s - 1292.71s |  And then in other areas, you're like, oh, yeah, it totally responds to market forces,
1292.71s - 1294.91s |  it responds to pricing or whatever.
1294.91s - 1298.63s |  Yeah, market forces aren't working in this market force aren't working.
1298.63s - 1305.87s |  And so it's funny, because like, when I started in professionally in this field in like 98,
1305.87s - 1309.79s |  we were like, okay, we're gonna run software vulnerability scanning tools, and we're going
1309.79s - 1314.03s |  to release scores against products.
1314.03s - 1319.07s |  This will be like an 8.2 on the 1999 score system or whatever.
1319.07s - 1321.95s |  And consumers will make informed decisions.
1321.95s - 1325.39s |  You will all make informed decisions because you'll want to buy the thing with a higher
1325.39s - 1326.39s |  score.
1326.39s - 1332.47s |  Oh, well, the software shrink wrap license prevents that.
1332.47s - 1336.27s |  Like, oh, why would you prevent people testing your software?
1336.27s - 1339.27s |  That was my first inkling like something is very wrong here.
1339.27s - 1343.71s |  But have you looked at the standard contract language for software?
1343.71s - 1346.75s |  You bear the entire risk of this product.
1346.75s - 1348.35s |  And it's like part of the issue.
1348.35s - 1354.43s |  It's religion and software where there's no liability.
1354.43s - 1357.15s |  Every other industry in the world has liability.
1357.15s - 1358.15s |  Death and taxes.
1358.15s - 1359.15s |  Yeah, it's crazy.
1359.15s - 1363.47s |  Okay, so okay, so we're not going to get it with this.
1363.47s - 1365.23s |  The insurance industry.
1365.23s - 1370.27s |  So now we're into the early 2000s, the insurance industry will come along, and they will mandate
1370.27s - 1375.91s |  rates and better inform and then companies want to save money.
1375.91s - 1378.07s |  Then that didn't happen.
1378.07s - 1379.99s |  And now here we are.
1379.99s - 1380.99s |  Governments looking at their tool belt.
1380.99s - 1381.99s |  They're like, what do we got?
1381.99s - 1382.99s |  What do we got?
1382.99s - 1383.99s |  Okay.
1383.99s - 1384.99s |  Industry didn't work.
1384.99s - 1386.55s |  Self-regulation didn't work.
1386.55s - 1387.55s |  Insurance didn't work.
1387.55s - 1388.55s |  Oh, no.
1388.55s - 1390.39s |  I only have regulation left.
1390.39s - 1392.59s |  Like we're running out of tools.
1392.59s - 1397.51s |  And it's frustrating, but I know exactly how we got here.
1397.51s - 1401.75s |  You know, this is not a surprise that we're now at the point of talking about liability.
1401.75s - 1403.43s |  We saw this coming for decades.
1403.43s - 1408.95s |  I love to quote Dan Kaminsky on this, who said like, you know, security was never a
1408.95s - 1412.83s |  consideration when the internet was invented.
1412.83s - 1416.07s |  The internet was invented to move pictures of cats.
1416.07s - 1418.19s |  It's very good at that.
1418.19s - 1422.31s |  But I do think, so at the end of the day, we are a voluntary agency, but, you know,
1422.31s - 1428.09s |  we started out at RSA, we have this secure by design pledge, where companies are signing
1428.09s - 1433.97s |  up to it, committing to make material progress in seven key areas, you know, increasing
1433.97s - 1439.89s |  use of MFA, decreasing use of default password, eliminating whole classes of vulnerabilities.
1439.89s - 1446.09s |  And we had 68 vendors that signed at RSA, three months later, we're nearly at 200.
1446.09s - 1450.45s |  And I think there's virtue in being able to track progress and transparently report on
1450.45s - 1451.45s |  it.
1451.45s - 1455.05s |  Like that's a way, it's not like we're going to give people scores and stuff, and we're
1455.05s - 1456.85s |  going to have a third party do it.
1456.89s - 1458.89s |  So I really think transparency...
1458.89s - 1463.57s |  I like that you have the cycle, because otherwise they just stamp it and then they never...
1463.57s - 1467.89s |  No, I mean, as you say, transparency creates trust.
1467.89s - 1472.25s |  And part of that then will help consumers say, well, did you sign the pledge?
1472.25s - 1475.33s |  How did you do on implementing the pledge?
1475.33s - 1482.33s |  And you know, that will help to build, I think, greater security and resilience into the ecosystem.
1482.33s - 1485.93s |  I think product makers love to differentiate themselves.
1486.01s - 1489.93s |  And so if you give them some ways to differentiate, maybe their marketing team takes it and runs
1489.93s - 1490.93s |  with it.
1490.93s - 1491.93s |  Yeah.
1491.93s - 1496.17s |  And then they maybe respond to you giving them more tools that they can use to differentiate
1496.17s - 1497.17s |  themselves.
1497.17s - 1498.17s |  No, I totally agree.
1498.17s - 1499.65s |  Should we see if anyone has questions for us?
1499.65s - 1500.65s |  Yeah.
1500.65s - 1501.65s |  We're coming down to 20 minutes left.
1501.65s - 1503.17s |  Let's see how this goes.
1503.17s - 1504.17s |  And if you...
1504.17s - 1505.81s |  20 minutes of questions.
1505.81s - 1508.01s |  As you terrify us, we'll just drink.
1508.01s - 1509.01s |  AJA.
1509.01s - 1510.01s |  Ask Jeff.
1510.01s - 1511.01s |  AJJA.
1511.01s - 1512.01s |  Ask Jeff.
1512.01s - 1513.01s |  Okay, go ahead.
1513.01s - 1517.01s |  Do you want to tell us where you're from or anything to give us a little bit of perspective?
1517.01s - 1519.45s |  Oh, wait.
1519.45s - 1520.45s |  Wait.
1520.45s - 1524.73s |  Let's turn on the microphone in the Q&A session area.
1524.73s - 1525.73s |  Try speaking at it again.
1525.73s - 1528.61s |  We'll see if they've turned it up.
1528.61s - 1529.61s |  Number four.
1529.61s - 1530.61s |  Okay.
1530.61s - 1531.61s |  There it is.
1531.61s - 1532.61s |  Yeah.
1532.61s - 1533.61s |  You got to be close to the microphone, though.
1533.61s - 1534.61s |  Oh, yeah.
1534.61s - 1535.61s |  Wait, wait.
1535.61s - 1544.34s |  You got to be closer than that.
1544.34s - 1545.34s |  Okay.
1545.34s - 1546.34s |  Yeah.
1546.50s - 1549.78s |  Well, they say you basically have to eat the microphone for it to work.
1549.78s - 1564.38s |  So yes.
1564.38s - 1574.96s |  My job is done here.
1574.96s - 1639.10s |  Thanks dude.
1639.10s - 1640.10s |  Yeah.
1640.10s - 1641.10s |  No, it's a great question.
1641.10s - 1644.66s |  Thank you for the kind words.
1644.66s - 1649.58s |  Before I answer that, can I give you one of my pet peeves?
1649.58s - 1656.02s |  The names that we call these threat actors drive me frickin' bananas.
1656.02s - 1668.78s |  I mean, you know, Midnight Blizzard, Fancy Bear, Wizard Spider, Nemesis Kitten, The Lazarus
1668.78s - 1671.86s |  Group, Volt Typhoon.
1671.86s - 1673.98s |  That's redonkulous, man.
1673.98s - 1675.62s |  I'm on this campaign.
1675.62s - 1682.81s |  So I want to rename all these things, scrawny nuisance, right?
1682.81s - 1683.81s |  I got more.
1683.81s - 1684.81s |  I got more.
1684.81s - 1692.07s |  Stable Ferret, Weak Weasel, and my favorite, Doofus Dingo.
1692.07s - 1696.55s |  That's what I'm talking about, right?
1696.55s - 1702.55s |  So it's a great question and you know, frankly, this is something that we are super focused
1702.55s - 1706.73s |  on at CISA and it's a threat that's different in kind.
1706.73s - 1713.99s |  For most of my career, we really focused on China as a threat of espionage, data theft,
1713.99s - 1719.99s |  theft, and over the past couple years, we have seen Chinese cyberspace force actors
1719.99s - 1726.11s |  embedding deep within our critical infrastructure, not for espionage, but rather to launch disruptive
1726.11s - 1731.59s |  or destructive attacks in the event of a conflict in Taiwan.
1731.59s - 1738.27s |  So it's a world where a war in Asia will have very real impacts on the lives of Americans.
1738.27s - 1744.87s |  You would see pipelines exploding, pollution of water systems, severing of telecommunications,
1744.87s - 1751.87s |  derailing of transportation nodes, all specifically to incite societal panic and chaos and deter
1751.87s - 1755.83s |  our ability to marshal military might and citizen will.
1755.83s - 1757.39s |  And so it is a very real threat.
1757.39s - 1762.51s |  It's not a theoretical one, because our hunt teams have actually worked with the private
1762.51s - 1770.83s |  sector to identify and eradicate these actors from multiple sectors, water, power, comms,
1770.83s - 1771.83s |  transportation.
1771.83s - 1778.19s |  So really a real threat, and it's why we are making the case to how important resilience
1778.19s - 1780.31s |  is for every single business.
1780.31s - 1783.95s |  But to your point, they are using living off the land techniques.
1783.95s - 1785.95s |  So it's not like malware, right?
1785.95s - 1789.99s |  They're actually using the native processes of the system.
1789.99s - 1794.91s |  And within the compromised infrastructure, they are hard to find.
1794.91s - 1796.63s |  We have fantastic talents.
1796.63s - 1798.75s |  It's a kudos to our threat hunt team.
1798.75s - 1802.07s |  They've actually been able to find and identify them.
1802.07s - 1804.47s |  But once they're in the infrastructure, they're hard to find.
1804.47s - 1809.83s |  But the thing, the secure by design angle is the way that they're getting into the infrastructure
1809.83s - 1813.91s |  is they're using edge devices as a launch point.
1813.91s - 1818.55s |  And those edge devices are actually very easy to compromise.
1818.55s - 1823.95s |  And one of the vendors who we've been working with actually credit to them, because they
1823.95s - 1828.27s |  were the first ones to sign the pledge, is Avanti.
1828.27s - 1832.55s |  But that's an edge device, one of many, that the Chinese are taking advantage of to hop
1832.55s - 1835.03s |  into our critical infrastructure.
1835.03s - 1840.23s |  And so what we did, we actually put out an emergency directive and told all of the federal
1840.23s - 1846.15s |  civilian agencies, you need to pull out this piece of technology, because we cannot guarantee
1846.47s - 1849.63s |  that it does not implicate risk.
1849.63s - 1853.39s |  And frankly, we work with that company.
1853.39s - 1857.83s |  And we realize that it has an issue on reputation and business, but they were really good to
1857.83s - 1858.83s |  work with.
1858.83s - 1859.83s |  They signed the pledge.
1859.83s - 1860.83s |  They're making progress.
1860.83s - 1861.83s |  We're going to track it.
1861.83s - 1864.43s |  But that, at the end of the day, that's the complexity.
1864.43s - 1869.31s |  Yes, there are ways to find these actors if you know what to look for.
1869.31s - 1872.83s |  But also the way that they're getting in, we've made it easy on them, because we're
1872.83s - 1877.71s |  not demanding enough from our technology vendors, and that's what our push for Secure
1877.71s - 1878.71s |  by Design is.
1878.71s - 1883.39s |  Okay, let's go to the next question.
1883.39s - 1926.66s |  You got to get really close in there.
1926.66s - 1927.66s |  Yeah.
1927.66s - 1930.38s |  So your last question, absolutely.
1930.38s - 1935.98s |  We are working across the federal government to ensure that we are eating our own dog food
1935.98s - 1940.94s |  when it comes to Secure by Design, or drinking our own bourbon, as it were, when it comes
1940.94s - 1941.94s |  to Secure by Design.
1942.10s - 1945.50s |  And we work closely with GSA on FedRAMP.
1945.50s - 1949.38s |  But we are absolutely using all of the tools of procurement.
1949.38s - 1955.82s |  Just last week, we put out a Secure by Demand focused software acquisition guide for government
1955.82s - 1957.22s |  enterprise customers.
1957.22s - 1962.74s |  And then we put out something earlier this week, Secure by Demand for software customers.
1962.74s - 1969.18s |  So questions that you can ask of vendors to see how they are prioritizing security.
1969.18s - 1972.38s |  So yes is the answer to your second question.
1972.38s - 1977.26s |  Look, for the first one, I'm the head goalie for cyber.
1977.26s - 1978.86s |  We're the cyber defenders.
1978.86s - 1985.30s |  But we do work very closely with folks like Ambassador Nate Fick, who is the cyber ambassador.
1985.30s - 1990.62s |  We work very closely with NSA, with CyberCom, and with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
1990.62s - 1997.34s |  And I have to say, I think that we have, as a government, become more cohesive, more coherent,
1997.34s - 2003.50s |  when we are using levers that have not necessarily been used as aggressively before to hold other
2003.50s - 2010.14s |  governments accountable, whether it's through justice or whether it's in diplomatic ways.
2010.14s - 2013.22s |  I get you that there is more to be done.
2013.22s - 2016.06s |  There is always more to be done in this world.
2016.06s - 2023.74s |  But I do think that across the federal government, we have attempted to more forcefully attribute
2023.74s - 2032.26s |  activity and hold partners accountable for being involved in malicious cyber activity.
2032.26s - 2037.26s |  So I've got a question on that.
2037.26s - 2040.90s |  I always like to say internet problems are global problems.
2040.90s - 2049.56s |  And so even when you have different opinions with China on a political issue, there's still
2049.56s - 2051.68s |  a giant manufacturer.
2051.68s - 2056.08s |  If there's a problem in a product or a defective something or other, you still have to talk
2056.08s - 2060.68s |  with China because chances are they're manufacturing the thing, right?
2060.68s - 2067.52s |  So you still need to maintain positive relationships, working relationships with the manufacturers
2067.52s - 2068.84s |  around the entire world.
2068.84s - 2072.84s |  And sometimes those manufacturers are in countries who are having a political disagreement.
2072.84s - 2077.72s |  But you still have to have positive relationships because they're producing the thing, right?
2077.72s - 2079.08s |  So you have to have a sort of a nuance.
2079.60s - 2085.52s |  And I think maybe CISA is in a unique position in that, like you mentioned earlier, you're
2085.52s - 2090.12s |  not intelligence community, you're not military, right?
2090.12s - 2091.40s |  You're civilian.
2091.40s - 2097.68s |  So you can speak from a different perspective that's more civilian than military.
2097.68s - 2098.68s |  Yeah.
2098.68s - 2104.28s |  And, you know, that opportunity has not come up.
2104.28s - 2107.72s |  I think we talked about this as one of the early meetings, like having the head of CISA
2107.88s - 2114.80s |  and the head of China's CERT together, frankly, given some of the things that we have seen
2114.80s - 2121.44s |  them doing in our critical infrastructure, which I don't think that they've owned up
2121.44s - 2122.44s |  to.
2122.44s - 2125.16s |  In fact, they've completely denied it.
2125.16s - 2131.40s |  I think that's really problematic because at the end of the day, these targets are civilian
2131.40s - 2134.16s |  critical infrastructure.
2134.16s - 2139.00s |  And I would be happy to have discussions that were in good faith, where we thought
2139.00s - 2143.56s |  we could make real progress, but I'm not sure we're at that stage right now.
2143.56s - 2176.76s |  OK, let's go to the next gentleman.
2176.76s - 2177.76s |  Take what off the table?
2177.76s - 2189.63s |  Why are we taking it off the table?
2189.63s - 2193.55s |  So if you magically have secured by design and it achieves all of its goals and it's
2193.55s - 2195.95s |  done, what's next in line?
2195.95s - 2200.63s |  But are you...
2200.63s - 2201.63s |  Oh, what's the next...
2201.63s - 2204.98s |  I don't know if I heard that.
2204.98s - 2205.98s |  What is it?
2206.06s - 2209.62s |  So it's basically, if you have secure by design success and Rust and everybody in the world
2209.62s - 2211.90s |  is using Rust, what's next?
2211.90s - 2212.90s |  Yeah.
2212.90s - 2217.74s |  So, you know, I sort of said tongue in cheek yesterday, we want to get to a world where
2217.74s - 2222.74s |  the community works to make products so secure that cybersecurity goes away.
2222.74s - 2227.42s |  I mean, the reason we have the cybersecurity industry is because technology vendors have
2227.42s - 2235.14s |  been able to create flawed, defective, insecure products, or defective for decades, right?
2235.30s - 2240.94s |  Because it's been all about incentives have been speed to market and features, not security.
2240.94s - 2249.02s |  So if we actually achieve secure by design, I mean, I will be like doing the Snoopy dance
2249.02s - 2250.30s |  everywhere, right?
2250.30s - 2256.34s |  Because that will be a world where ransomware is a shocking anomaly and where damaging software
2256.34s - 2259.70s |  vulnerabilities are as infrequent as plane crashes.
2259.70s - 2265.82s |  Now, does that mean that vulnerabilities or defects will go away completely?
2265.82s - 2267.38s |  No, of course not.
2267.38s - 2272.54s |  I fundamentally believe you can dramatically drive down the number of exploitable defects,
2272.54s - 2279.46s |  but there will still be room for the research community, the hacking community.
2279.46s - 2285.46s |  I mean, this community is actually responsible for making us all better, right?
2285.46s - 2289.62s |  We run the coordinated vulnerability disclosure program for the US government.
2289.62s - 2297.54s |  So we work with researchers all the time and we have an enormous respect and admiration
2297.54s - 2302.14s |  for folks and we intermediate between hackers and product owners.
2302.14s - 2307.78s |  And I don't think that will go away completely, but we do want to live in a world where the
2307.78s - 2311.70s |  number of defects in our products is dramatically lowered.
2311.70s - 2316.18s |  I mean, that will be a better world for all of us where we don't have to worry about our
2316.18s - 2320.94s |  parents constantly having to deal with malware and all of this.
2320.94s - 2324.22s |  So there will always be a role for hackers.
2324.22s - 2325.22s |  Yeah.
2325.22s - 2332.10s |  And even if every bit of code in the universe is memory safe, temporally, spatially memory
2332.10s - 2336.66s |  safe, there's always going to be business logic flaws.
2336.66s - 2340.74s |  There's so many other categories, but that's what you want to do, right?
2340.74s - 2341.74s |  You want to push them up the stack.
2341.74s - 2343.34s |  You want the difficulty to become harder.
2343.34s - 2344.98s |  You don't want a mass exploit.
2344.98s - 2349.30s |  We want you to have to spend all the time in the world understanding one business system
2349.30s - 2354.42s |  to exploit some business logic flaw in one thing instead of a single one-off that can
2354.42s - 2356.38s |  devastate an entire landscape.
2356.38s - 2360.34s |  Create massive friction for attackers, for squandering.
2360.34s - 2362.02s |  And you want to make it be more noisy.
2362.02s - 2365.26s |  So when they do do something, it's more visible.
2365.26s - 2388.76s |  And so, okay.
2388.76s - 2397.27s |  Thanks dude.
2397.27s - 2398.87s |  Well thank you.
2398.87s - 2417.58s |  Under twin powers, activate.
2417.58s - 2419.42s |  That AI will unleash, you mean?
2419.42s - 2432.01s |  Threat of AI.
2432.01s - 2433.01s |  Threat of AI.
2433.01s - 2434.01s |  Yeah, I'll tell you.
2434.01s - 2440.69s |  So the interesting thing is, it's really, we might have to drink to the end of CAPTCHA,
2440.69s - 2441.69s |  right?
2441.69s - 2443.65s |  I mean, if AI is that good, right?
2443.65s - 2449.09s |  I mean, so for example, we run this, you caught on to the fact we're really big into community.
2449.09s - 2454.89s |  And so DEF CON, a couple of years ago, we started the mastodon server, DEF CON.social.
2454.93s - 2460.25s |  And before Elon bought Twitter, we were kind of hedging our bets.
2460.25s - 2464.29s |  So we started to build our mastodon server, just in case things go south.
2464.29s - 2467.93s |  Things went south, mastodon.
2467.93s - 2469.97s |  And so people are signing up to the service.
2469.97s - 2472.93s |  And now you put in a CAPTCHA.
2472.93s - 2474.37s |  And so we use H-CAPTCHA.
2474.37s - 2478.77s |  It's the more friendly CAPTCHA, more privacy respecting CAPTCHA.
2478.77s - 2484.25s |  Well then you start paying attention, like, does this CAPTCHA actually prevent spam signups?
2484.25s - 2487.93s |  And it's supposedly a very performant CAPTCHA.
2487.93s - 2497.73s |  And you start reading academic studies, H-CAPTCHA can be bypassed 98% of the time.
2497.73s - 2501.77s |  But the competitors are 99% of the time.
2501.77s - 2503.57s |  Do you know who created CAPTCHA?
2503.57s - 2506.77s |  We're 50% more effective.
2506.77s - 2509.69s |  Do you know where CAPTCHA was created?
2509.69s - 2510.69s |  Do you know who created it?
2510.69s - 2511.69s |  Who?
2511.69s - 2512.69s |  It was at Carnegie Mellon.
2512.69s - 2513.69s |  Carnegie Mellon, yeah.
2514.13s - 2517.53s |  And that's why we did our, well not why, but one of the cool reasons we did our secure
2517.53s - 2518.53s |  by design launch.
2518.53s - 2520.77s |  It was at Carnegie Mellon.
2520.77s - 2525.49s |  So then you're like, okay, well, that's the defeat rate.
2525.49s - 2527.37s |  What's the human rate?
2527.37s - 2533.49s |  Humans can bypass CAPTCHA 78% of the time.
2533.49s - 2539.05s |  So it's like, well, if you don't make a mistake, you're probably a robot.
2539.05s - 2540.49s |  So you have to make some mistakes.
2540.49s - 2542.73s |  And so that's done.
2542.77s - 2546.21s |  I don't see CAPTCHAs, right?
2546.21s - 2551.62s |  And it's sad because, oh no, we're defenseless.
2551.62s - 2555.34s |  But we better own up to it really quick because pretending that we're not defenseless, that's
2555.34s - 2556.34s |  not going to work.
2556.34s - 2557.34s |  Right?
2557.34s - 2560.26s |  And so it feels like AI is going to fundamentally change some of this stuff.
2560.26s - 2566.66s |  Like one of the questions is, okay, well, almost perfect voice duplication for these
2566.66s - 2569.42s |  CEO takeover voice attacks.
2569.42s - 2570.42s |  Yeah.
2570.42s - 2571.42s |  Okay.
2571.42s - 2572.90s |  Well, that's reality.
2572.90s - 2574.90s |  We can't pretend we're going back.
2574.90s - 2577.34s |  So no more voice authentication.
2577.34s - 2578.34s |  Okay.
2578.34s - 2581.42s |  But we better own up to that really quick.
2581.42s - 2582.42s |  Right?
2582.42s - 2583.42s |  Well, yeah.
2583.42s - 2584.42s |  I mean, I'd say a couple of things.
2584.42s - 2587.74s |  Like I am a tech optimist.
2587.74s - 2590.14s |  I'm an optimist in general, and I'm a tech optimist.
2590.14s - 2592.90s |  I wouldn't be in this business if I weren't.
2592.90s - 2598.74s |  We just named a chief AI officer, Lisa Einstein, who kicked some serious ass.
2598.74s - 2599.74s |  I'm really proud of her.
2599.74s - 2600.74s |  Lisa Einstein, please stand up.
2600.74s - 2601.74s |  Chief AI officer.
2601.74s - 2602.74s |  Lisa.
2602.74s - 2603.74s |  Rock on.
2603.74s - 2604.74s |  Yay.
2604.74s - 2612.74s |  Because we want to ensure that we are leveraging these capabilities for cyber defense, but
2612.74s - 2618.30s |  we also want to make sure that we are reducing risk from these capabilities to critical infrastructure.
2618.30s - 2621.82s |  So we put out a roadmap with a lot of the work that we're doing.
2621.82s - 2629.54s |  We put out a guide specific on secure by design for AI with international partners, federal
2629.54s - 2630.54s |  partners.
2631.22s - 2635.94s |  As we've been talking about software, like AI, the same rules apply to AI.
2635.94s - 2642.82s |  You have to consider security first, because these are very powerful, fast-moving capabilities,
2642.82s - 2644.70s |  but we don't want to be scared of them.
2644.70s - 2647.18s |  We want to be able to optimize the use of them.
2647.18s - 2652.18s |  And so we're excited about the power of it.
2652.18s - 2657.02s |  There's a lot of hype here, so we don't want to get sucked into the hype, but we were at
2657.02s - 2658.02s |  the AICC.
2659.02s - 2661.94s |  I think you guys just heard from those folks yesterday.
2661.94s - 2665.58s |  And so if there are things that can be done with some of these capabilities to find and
2665.58s - 2672.58s |  fix vulnerabilities, the thing that I am very excited about is the ability to use AI to
2672.58s - 2677.54s |  refactor code from memory unsafe to memory safe.
2677.54s - 2683.38s |  Think about how that could have a transformative impact on some of the defects that we have
2683.38s - 2685.10s |  to deal with on a daily basis.
2685.78s - 2690.46s |  I think we should get excited about it, but I don't think we should get Skynet scared
2690.46s - 2691.46s |  about it.
2691.46s - 2697.42s |  The only thing I'd say is, I spent a lot of my life doing counterterrorism.
2697.42s - 2705.18s |  I was in Iraq twice, Afghanistan, and we used to talk about Al-Qaeda's chief bomb maker
2705.18s - 2711.98s |  a lot, and now you think about Al-Qaeda's chief AI officer.
2711.98s - 2713.66s |  That ain't good.
2713.66s - 2717.90s |  The pictures of the data centers in the tunnels.
2717.90s - 2719.30s |  That's just ungood.
2719.30s - 2725.90s |  And so we want to make sure that these capabilities are protected from being used by terrorists
2725.90s - 2729.74s |  and criminals and rogue nations to do real harm.
2729.74s - 2734.14s |  Okay, we only have time for one question.
2734.14s - 2735.26s |  I'm sorry.
2735.26s - 2736.62s |  So you've got it.
2736.62s - 2738.94s |  Hopefully it's...
2738.94s - 2739.94s |  Go for it.
2739.94s - 2743.46s |  Better be the greatest question ever.
2743.46s - 2744.46s |  No pressure.
2744.46s - 2745.46s |  No pressure.
2745.46s - 2746.46s |  No pressure.
2746.46s - 2749.38s |  No pressure.
2749.38s - 2750.38s |  Closer to the microphone.
2750.38s - 2751.38s |  Closer.
2751.38s - 2752.38s |  Closer to the microphone.
2752.38s - 2765.70s |  Right.
2765.70s - 2770.97s |  Okay, so the question is around cyber liability.
2770.97s - 2775.97s |  Do you think it's going to be hard to do because of all the laws around liability?
2775.97s - 2778.97s |  Yes, I do.
2778.97s - 2789.16s |  Because it's what?
2789.16s - 2790.16s |  Oh.
2790.16s - 2791.16s |  Oh, yeah.
2791.16s - 2792.16s |  No.
2792.16s - 2801.04s |  It's an interesting issue when you think about it because a lot of the incidents that happen,
2801.04s - 2805.08s |  we very much focus on the proximate cause, not the root cause.
2805.08s - 2806.80s |  So you're exactly right.
2806.80s - 2811.24s |  I mean, that's the issues around human error, like we had a ransomware attack because somebody
2811.24s - 2815.80s |  downloaded a malicious file or got phished into giving up their password, right?
2815.80s - 2820.72s |  So we always focus on the proximate cause, not the root cause.
2820.72s - 2826.04s |  And yeah, to get anything done like this is hard, and I always worry that it's going
2826.04s - 2831.72s |  to be a major devastating attack that actually gets some sort of legislation.
2831.72s - 2839.20s |  I mean, I think I would just give you my perspective from working closely with members of Congress.
2839.20s - 2840.20s |  They get this.
2840.20s - 2841.20s |  They understand.
2841.20s - 2846.04s |  I do think the report that we released, the Cyber Safety Review Board report, caught a
2846.04s - 2851.68s |  lot of attention in terms of how important a culture of security is, how important it
2851.68s - 2858.88s |  is for a vendor to take accountability and responsibility for producing secure software.
2858.88s - 2863.56s |  So I don't think it's impossible, but it will take a lot of work to do.
2863.56s - 2868.16s |  I do think that is something, you know, this is, as Jeff was saying, there's all kinds
2868.16s - 2871.56s |  of levers that can lead us to a more secure ecosystem.
2871.56s - 2879.21s |  I do think that is a very important one because it leads to a product differentiator.
2879.21s - 2880.21s |  Thank you for the question.
2880.21s - 2881.53s |  All right, everyone.
2881.53s - 2882.53s |  Let's give it up.
2882.53s - 2883.53s |  Thank you for being here.
2883.53s - 2884.53s |  Thanks, everybody.
2884.53s - 2885.53s |  Love you.
2885.53s - 2886.53s |  Bye.
2886.53s - 2887.53s |  Bye.
2887.53s - 2888.53s |  Bye.
2888.53s - 2889.53s |  Bye.
2889.53s - 2890.03s |  Bye.
