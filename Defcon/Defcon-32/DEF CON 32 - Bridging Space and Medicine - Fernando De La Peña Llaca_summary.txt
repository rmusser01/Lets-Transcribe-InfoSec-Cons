**Holographic Teleportation in Space and Medicine**

- **HoloLens and Mixed Reality:**
  - Device used for interacting with holograms and people
  - NASA surgeon assisted astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti using HoloLens

- **Successful Medical Procedure:**
  - Holograms showed incision points and measurements
  - Surgeons accessed x-rays and information during the procedure

- **Holographic Teleportation Development:**
  - Microsoft developed a studio with 109 cameras
  - Captures and delivers a file for hologram display on HoloLens

- **Challenges in Space:**
  - Limited equipment on space stations, only one camera available
  - Old computers used, requiring live processing
  - Communication issues due to moving satellites and limited bandwidth

- **Project Implementation:**
  - First human holoporter to space station: Dr. George Smith
  - One-way holoportation conducted successfully

- **Viral Media Coverage:**
  - NASA's press release went viral in multiple languages
  - Public interest in holoportation technology increased

- **Two-Way Holoportation:**
  - Plans for interaction between astronauts and mission control
  - Goal to implement by April 2020

- **Holoportation Technology Expansion:**
  - Multiple companies exploring holoportation technology
  - Efforts to make technology device agnostic and affordable

- **Applications and Future Developments:**
  - Potential uses in telemedicine and remote training
  - Plans for integrating AI in space medicine for emergencies

- **Company Initiatives:**
  - Splitting into Aerospace (government) and AXA Tech (commercial)
  - Developing HoloConnector for projecting holograms without glasses

- **Community Engagement:**
  - Encouragement to provide feedback for technology improvements
  - Aim to make holographic communication widely accessible
