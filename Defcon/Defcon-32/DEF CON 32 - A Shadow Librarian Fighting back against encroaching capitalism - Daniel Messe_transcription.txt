  "title": "DEF CON 32 - A Shadow Librarian: Fighting back against encroaching capitalism - Daniel Messe",
  "description": "The public library is under attack. Calls for book banning are at an all time high. Some states have passed laws that hold librarians legally accountable for offering \"unacceptable\" materials to minors. But before this fire started, another one was already burning. In an era of digital content, from eBooks to streaming movies, public libraries have been forced to accept draconian terms of service at the expense of their patrons and to the benefit of corporations. Grossly inflated eBook prices and licensing, unobtainable materials that went out of print due to artificial scarcity, exorbitant fees for access to academic research; these are just a few of the myriad of ways that libraries have been forced to bow before capitalism, all because of a desire to serve the public. But we can fight back...\n\nAnd no one says we need to fight fairly.\n\nI\u2019d like to tell you some real life stories of a public librarian with a quasi-legal, dark grey skillset. And I\u2019d love to share some ideas about what you can do to help others. If I can do this, you can. And anyone can be a shadow librarian.",

0.88s - 7.20s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 uh, welcome. Thank you all for coming to the track. Uh, the next speaker up is Daniel Messer.
7.20s - 12.00s |  And the talk is A Shadow Librarian in Broad Daylight. Uh, please give Daniel a warm welcome.
12.00s - 23.42s |  How y'all doing? Okay, so good afternoon. Thank you for coming. There's a whole lot of you
23.42s - 29.76s |  here to see a librarian talk at DEF CON. So, um, it's nice to have you. So, uh, to start off
29.76s - 35.62s |  with, quick disclaimer, you know, big disclaimer. Uh, hi, I'm not a hacker. I am not a
35.62s - 40.54s |  cybersecurity expert. I will not be talking about how I cracked some passwords that I found
40.54s - 46.00s |  on the dark web and used that to infiltrate some system. I won't be talking about that
46.00s - 53.14s |  cause that's nothing I have ever done. Um, but I think that you and I and all of you and
53.14s - 58.14s |  maybe I, uh, we share kind of a kindred relationship. Um, because though I am not a, I'm
60.94s - 65.94s |  not a hacker, I think we can both, uh, we can come together on a relationship based in fear.
68.48s - 73.48s |  Because people fear hackers. You know this. Some of you revel in this. And people are
76.12s - 81.12s |  starting to fear others like me too. In red states, from city councils to state capitals, uh,
84.10s - 90.94s |  I am a threat. And so are people like me. More legislation has been passed in the last few
90.94s - 95.94s |  months to, uh, curtail my activities than have been passed to curtail yours. Because I am
98.48s - 111.13s |  fucking dangerous. I am a public librarian. In the third century before the common era, there
113.27s - 118.57s |  was a great library in the city of Alexandria, Egypt. Many tales have been told about this
118.59s - 125.23s |  library and some of them are even true. One thing that isn't talked about as often as I think
125.23s - 131.31s |  it should be, is the Alexandrian acquisitions department. Yeah, I know, I know, thrilling
131.31s - 136.85s |  stuff messin' me, but hang on, we're gonna go someplace beyond an ancient library, okay?
136.85s - 143.59s |  See, there was a decree by Ptolemy II Philadelphus that among other things, ordered agents of
143.61s - 148.61s |  the library to, to search the ships and take any books that they found, borrow them. Now we're
152.59s - 156.63s |  talking about the city of Alexandria. This was one of the biggest centers of trade in human
156.63s - 162.69s |  history. We're talking about a lot of ships. These agents would snag any books and then bring
162.69s - 169.11s |  them back to the library where they would be copied and added to the collection. And it was
169.13s - 174.19s |  often the case that the ships would sail away with the copies while the library kept the
174.19s - 179.21s |  originals. Um, this was the first large scale version of a modern adage in that information
181.81s - 186.81s |  should be free and it should belong to me. In the year of our goddess, 2024, can you imagine a
190.49s - 195.49s |  library doing anything like that today? That library would have more lawyers at their front
195.91s - 200.91s |  door than they have children attending the herpetologist event at a summer reading program.
204.79s - 210.43s |  So, okay, yeah, maybe, uh, maybe some introductions before I really get into this. Hi, I'm Dan.
210.43s - 215.99s |  Uh, I've been working libraries for almost 30 years now. Uh, from the front desk to systems
215.99s - 222.27s |  administration and a few stops in between, you know. As a systems librarian, I specialize in
222.29s - 228.39s |  integrated library systems, which is the day to day operating system of a modern library,
228.39s - 233.39s |  checking the things out, checking the things in, managing the catalog, all that stuff. Um, so,
235.87s - 241.57s |  what I'm called is a systems librarian by most people. If you, um, I'm also into things like,
241.57s - 247.31s |  uh, SQL hacking. I say that I'm a SQL hacker because, uh, the way I typically get SQL to work
247.33s - 252.83s |  is that I write a query, I swear because it doesn't work, then I rewrite the query and I'm
252.83s - 258.13s |  closer but they're still swearing and finally the query works. So, I, yeah, that's how I hack
258.13s - 264.43s |  SQL. I'm also into data analysis and storytelling. Libraries love data, the sort of running
264.43s - 270.71s |  joke is that librarians are into stats and cats. Um, so, yeah, I'm into, I'm one of the data
270.71s - 275.65s |  guys where I work. No surprise I'm into library technology, self-checkout machines,
275.65s - 281.29s |  self-check-in machines, everything from the barcode on the front desk to the RFID tags
281.29s - 286.17s |  within the items. And this probably doesn't matter to anyone, I'm a circulation
286.17s - 291.17s |  methodologist. In other words, I can help libraries better circulate their materials. But,
294.71s - 298.87s |  one, one thing, um, one thing that you might also know me for is if you listen to library
298.87s - 303.71s |  related podcasts, I am known as your little free cyberpunk librarian. And with a name like
303.71s - 308.15s |  that, it shouldn't be, uh, it shouldn't be a real big surprise that I am into shadow
308.15s - 314.35s |  libraries. Um, I have been researching shadow libraries for about 10 years. I can't be, uh, I
314.35s - 318.85s |  can't be, uh, specific on that because I don't remember exactly when I started approaching it
318.85s - 323.89s |  as a topic of research rather than as a topic of usage. Um, so, yeah, I've done this for
323.89s - 329.73s |  about 10 years. I've worked in shadow libraries as a, uh, cataloger. In other words, if I am
329.75s - 335.07s |  presented with an e-book of questionable sources, um, and that e-book is lacking metadata, I
335.07s - 340.97s |  can help provide that metadata. I've also worked in interlibrary loan, which, uh, in this
340.97s - 345.97s |  case usually involves someone on the internet needs a PDF. And I can provide that PDF. But I've
348.17s - 352.85s |  also done work in acquisitions, aka book scanning, digitization, things like that. And I've
352.85s - 357.85s |  also done some system, uh, systems administration and development. So, okay, here's the deal.
360.33s - 367.33s |  As a public librarian and a shadow librarian, I work in two sides of the library world. The
367.33s - 372.33s |  public library, which I'm sure many of you are familiar with, and shadow libraries, which
374.81s - 381.51s |  I'm sure many of you are familiar with. Um, so, that might come as a surprise to you because
381.51s - 386.35s |  why would, why would a legit librarian go to the dark side? You know, why, why would I do
386.37s - 392.41s |  that? Well, you can encompass a lot of that under a heading of you do what you gotta do. I'm
392.41s - 397.41s |  here to serve the public in matters of information and media. And to a librarian, everything
400.85s - 405.85s |  is media. This podium, this podium I'm speaking from, librarians can totally catalog and
408.59s - 413.59s |  circulate this thing. Uh, we, we actually have a word for it. It's called realia. This is a
413.67s - 420.47s |  realistic thing, it's not a book, it's not a, you know, a piece of like a Blu-ray or anything
420.47s - 426.61s |  like that. This is realia. We can circulate this stuff. See, if you haven't been to your local
426.61s - 432.11s |  public library recently, I strongly encourage you to go. The reasons for that are stuff that
432.11s - 435.53s |  you probably already know, but I'll drop the two biggest ones just in case you need a
435.53s - 442.07s |  reminder. Number one, we lend you stuff for free. And, uh, with that, that could include
442.07s - 447.09s |  stuff that, uh, you didn't, you may not associate with public libraries, which is the
447.09s - 452.09s |  number two reason you should go to the library and see what they have. If you think we're just a
452.09s - 457.09s |  stronghold of books and Blu-rays, you might give it another look just in case. So, um, for
459.43s - 463.27s |  instance, I work with libraries all across the country and some of them have tool
463.27s - 468.53s |  collections, and I'm not talking about the band. Um, if you're, uh, if you're putting
468.53s - 474.71s |  something together and maybe you need a hammer or a cordless drill or something like that, but
474.71s - 478.61s |  you're not a handy person, you're not Norm Abram, so you don't want to just buy this, you're
478.61s - 483.79s |  just assembling something that you bought at Ikea, check, check with your local library. They,
483.79s - 487.99s |  uh, they might have a tool collection for you. Um, do you want to learn how to play the
487.99s - 494.13s |  guitar? Some libraries have musical instrument collections. So, this is great because you
494.13s - 499.13s |  can go lend, you can borrow that guitar and you don't have to buy one because later on if you
501.57s - 505.35s |  find out, well, playing the guitar isn't for me or I'm just not good at that. Well, if you
505.35s - 509.81s |  bought a guitar, now you have a symbol of your failure laying around your house. With the, with
509.81s - 514.83s |  the borrowed guitar, you just take it back to the library. So, I work with a library that has a
518.45s - 523.53s |  massive collection of cake pans. Literally, lots of cake pans. And you might think, cake
523.53s - 528.87s |  pans, well, how often do you need to make a Hello Kitty birthday cake? Maybe once a year? So,
528.87s - 534.97s |  why should you buy a Hello Kitty cake shaped cake pan for the other 364 days? Just go borrow
534.97s - 539.97s |  the thing. So, podiums, right? I'm just saying, sometimes people need to talk in front of a
542.15s - 549.15s |  crowd and, uh, you know what they might not have? Podium. It's not something you got laying
549.17s - 554.81s |  around your house most of the time. A library could buy, catalog and circulate one of these
554.81s - 559.35s |  things. I would not be surprised if that's something that's already happening in a library
559.35s - 565.79s |  somewhere. So, as I said, I am here to serve the public about information and media and
565.79s - 570.83s |  sometimes that stuff doesn't come easy. At one point in your lives, you may have gone to a
570.83s - 575.83s |  library for a story time. Um, so, you have your very own librarian right here, so let's, let's
579.23s - 584.21s |  have a story time. Sit back and relax. I'm going to tell you a couple of stories because it's
584.21s - 589.41s |  the war stories track, right? Um, I was going to bring puppets, but when I explained to the
589.41s - 593.71s |  DEF CON organizers what I wanted to do with them, they shot that idea down for ethical
593.71s - 600.33s |  reasons, so. Once upon a time, there was a law. It's a pretty good law, as laws go. And its name
600.39s - 605.39s |  was Title 17 United States Code Subsection 109A. Thank you. Big fans! Anyway. Uh, this little
614.83s - 619.83s |  bit of legislation does us the small service of providing only the entire foundation of how
622.91s - 627.91s |  libraries operate in the United States. But please, Title 17 United States Code Subsection 109A
630.95s - 636.55s |  that's a very long name, very complicated. So, it's got a nickname. It's called the First Sale
636.55s - 641.55s |  Doctrine. Simply stated, this law allows libraries to buy physical items and lend them. We can
644.59s - 649.59s |  lend books, blu-rays, and banjos. Uh, because when we buy them, we own them. And because we
652.17s - 657.17s |  own them, we can decide to lend them to others. So, more than one person has said that if a
657.35s - 662.35s |  library didn't exist today, it would probably be illegal to create one. And that's because
665.25s - 671.79s |  media publishers would never let a law like this pass if this was something that came forward
671.79s - 676.79s |  today. So, this law is great though when it comes to physical items. What about the digital
679.49s - 684.41s |  stuff? So, hey, you might not have known this either if you haven't been to the library for a
684.41s - 689.25s |  little while. Uh, did you know you can check out stuff at the library and never leave your
689.25s - 694.25s |  home? You can get things from e-books and digital comics. You can stream music and movies. Uh,
696.13s - 701.37s |  you can download magazines and read the news. You don't even have to put on pants. Just get
701.37s - 706.37s |  your tablet, get your phone, log into your library account and get stuff for free. Legally,
707.17s - 712.17s |  for a change. And that, dear hearts, that's the problem. Digital items are not sold. They're
719.75s - 726.69s |  licensed. And licensing does not equal ownership. And libraries all across the country are
726.69s - 731.69s |  seeing a steep rise in their public's desire for digital items. Okay, well, so what? Well, how
732.69s - 737.69s |  much do you pay for an e-book on Amazon? Maybe about 15 bucks or so, give or take, you know, if
740.99s - 747.33s |  it's new or it's big or whatever. Say about 15 bucks. And keep in mind, you are licensing it
747.33s - 754.57s |  too. You don't own that. Um, but you are just a single licensee reading the book on your
754.57s - 761.41s |  devices. Fine. Libraries, on the other hand, we want to lend e-books to multiple people so
761.43s - 768.11s |  they can read it on multiple devices. And publishers, they don't like that. They
768.11s - 774.81s |  absolutely see that as lost sales. Do you know how much a library will pay for the same e-book
774.81s - 779.81s |  that you bought on Amazon for 15 bucks? 60. They will pay about 4 times the cost so that you
784.79s - 790.89s |  can have access to an e-book. And that's for a single user license. Well, what the hell is a
790.91s - 795.85s |  single user license? A single user license basically says that one person can check out that
795.85s - 800.85s |  e-book at a time. Just like a physical book. It's an e-book. It's not like we have a problem
804.29s - 809.29s |  making copies of it, but the licensing is that one person can have that book at a time. So, more
811.97s - 818.57s |  than that, publishers will also literally withhold sales to, to libraries. Um, because they
818.59s - 823.25s |  want to hit that buyer's market first. The new, you know, James Patterson pulls a lever and
823.25s - 828.27s |  publishes a novel and the, the publisher might not offer that as a e-book to libraries because
831.83s - 837.73s |  they want to hit that buyer's market first. Those free-loading librarians can just wait to
837.73s - 843.87s |  pay 4 times the amount for that e-book because, you know, the publishing industry got to get
843.87s - 850.45s |  paid, son. Oh, and by the way, that license is good for anywhere from a few months to maybe a
850.45s - 855.45s |  couple years. And then the library has to license the book again. Why? Did it wear out?
861.23s - 866.23s |  Actually, that's the story. The publishers, uh, and the sellers will tell you that a physical book
866.67s - 871.67s |  will wear out over time, so you're going to need to replace it. So, that's all we're doing, we're
874.11s - 879.61s |  just emulating what's happening in the physical book. That's okay, right? Beloved, there are
879.61s - 884.61s |  books in libraries that are over 200 years old. Travel to Europe, there are books in libraries
887.99s - 893.55s |  that are centuries old. Um, yeah, you might not be able to check them out and take them home,
893.55s - 898.55s |  granted, but I bet they're still somehow available for use. There's not an e-book around right
901.19s - 907.95s |  now that is even half as old as some of the oldest books in a, in a library. In other words, this
907.95s - 913.03s |  is just good old fashioned bog standard capitalism at work. You, you've heard of forced
913.03s - 918.03s |  scarcity, I'm sure. This is enforced scarcity. We live in a time where nothing, nothing ever
918.55s - 923.55s |  needs to go out of print. And even things that have gone out of print, they could be digitized,
927.37s - 934.19s |  resurrected and brought forward. And, you know, Google did that. And they got away with it
934.19s - 938.37s |  because they're Google. And then the Internet Archive did that, got sued and had to remove
938.37s - 943.37s |  500,000 books from their collection. Um, because of course, of course, that represents a loss of
948.17s - 954.31s |  sales. As a counterpoint, according to Publishers Weekly and the Association of American
954.31s - 959.31s |  Publishers, the United States publishing industry made over 12.5 billion dollars last year. We
961.85s - 966.85s |  should all have some of those lost sales. How do they survive? And with the growing demand for
969.33s - 974.59s |  e-books, library budgets are feeling that pinch more than ever because e-book licenses are
974.59s - 980.83s |  more or less twice the price of a physical book. A new dead tree book might cost 20, 25
980.83s - 987.37s |  bucks. A library could buy two books for 50 bucks, or they can buy one single e-book license
987.37s - 992.37s |  for 10 dollars more. I mean, fiscally, those physical items make more sense, but that's not
995.41s - 1001.89s |  what people are after. And beyond that though, what do you do when you're faced with a
1001.89s - 1008.59s |  patron who needs an item, but that item is almost unobtainable? Because Amikoi, my God, we
1008.59s - 1012.79s |  haven't even talked about things like the price of journals, like academic journals. Any
1012.79s - 1018.37s |  students here today, anyone working on a bachelor's, a master's, maybe even a doctorate. I
1018.37s - 1024.65s |  got, I got a few hands, awesome. Okay, so do you know how much money your college library
1024.65s - 1030.81s |  spends per year for access to academic articles and publications? I want you to think of a
1030.83s - 1035.43s |  number. A price that sounds reasonable, let's not get cos, cos, you know, cosmically
1035.43s - 1040.87s |  stratospheric here, but a price that sounds reasonable. What do you think your university is
1040.87s - 1045.89s |  paying for access to those academic journals? Got that number? No, you're wrong, it's higher.
1045.89s - 1050.89s |  The, the cost of academic journals and access to those publications is insane and it's
1053.65s - 1059.09s |  obscene, and never mind that many of the articles that these students are after were written
1059.11s - 1065.71s |  by researchers and scientists working with public funds. So, if you're a student browsing a
1065.71s - 1072.41s |  database of publications at your uni's library and you find what you need, I, holy crap, here
1072.41s - 1077.05s |  it is, this, this is what I'm looking for. I know this author. They're working in my arena.
1077.05s - 1083.09s |  This will go a long way to helping me finish my master's thesis or my doctoral dissertation.
1083.13s - 1088.13s |  Fantastic. And they don't have it. This is the heartbreak of the abstract, where all they
1092.77s - 1097.91s |  have is the abstract. Your library, for some reason, just does not have access to that
1097.91s - 1105.12s |  article. So, imagine yourself now as a librarian. You've got that patron looking for a book
1107.26s - 1112.74s |  that's had one print run and hasn't been published again since the 1970s. You've got a patron
1112.74s - 1118.52s |  who needs an indie film that was made in 1990 and can't be found anywhere. Or you've got
1118.52s - 1124.86s |  this student who needs the article, but you don't have it. When I was in high school, never
1124.86s - 1129.86s |  mind how many years ago, a friend of mine taught me something that literally stuck with me
1129.86s - 1134.40s |  ever since. I could put this on a business card and it would make some sense for me. And that
1134.40s - 1139.40s |  thing is, is when what you need don't meet your eyes, you must learn to improvise. So, time
1139.60s - 1144.60s |  to improvise. Due to patron confidentiality, I will not divulge the title of this book,
1147.64s - 1153.18s |  except to say it was a work of fiction written in the 1970s by some author I had never heard
1153.18s - 1159.72s |  of. The patron read this book back in their younger days. And like a fever dream, it popped
1159.72s - 1164.60s |  into their head again and they just, they needed to read it again. And hey, I get it. I don't
1164.60s - 1168.96s |  know about you, but as a librarian, there's certain books that I always go back to. I cannot
1168.96s - 1176.90s |  tell you how many times I've read Neuromancer and the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's
1176.90s - 1181.90s |  like comfort food. Now, libraries have various networks that they can go through to do
1184.28s - 1189.28s |  something magical. And that magical thing is interlibrary loan. And if you're not familiar
1191.82s - 1198.42s |  with it, no shame. Today, you are one of today's lucky 10,000. So, let me tell you about
1198.46s - 1204.62s |  interlibrary loan. See, if you go to a library and they don't have the thing you need, you can
1204.62s - 1209.76s |  talk to someone there and they can try to get it from another library. Maybe even at a
1209.76s - 1214.34s |  completely different state, sometimes in a completely different country. You may have to
1214.34s - 1221.40s |  pay for shipping, but they can help you get that weird and wonderful thing that cannot be
1221.40s - 1226.22s |  found anywhere else. And that's exactly what I did. I, you know, worked with this patron, I
1226.22s - 1230.98s |  looked it up in the computer, we placed a request through an interlibrary loan network and
1230.98s - 1236.00s |  we waited for the item to arrive. Which it did. Just the next week. In pieces. It's a paperback
1242.00s - 1248.80s |  from the 1970s. Do you know what they used to make binding glue out of in the 1970s?
1248.80s - 1256.19s |  Lysergic acid diethylamide and the dreams of small children. I called this patron and I
1256.19s - 1262.85s |  said, hey, um, I got your thing, but there's this problem. And they were heartbroken. That's
1262.85s - 1267.13s |  one of my favorite patrons. They were afraid to check it out because they didn't want to
1267.13s - 1270.73s |  further damage that. I don't know how they would have done that other than sticking it in a
1270.73s - 1277.27s |  blender with some protein powder. Um, but dammit, I hated to disappoint this person. And the
1277.27s - 1281.57s |  lending library that responded was the only lending library that responded. It was either this
1281.59s - 1286.59s |  copy or nothing. Time for the lie. This patron, I'll call him Joe. I'm talking to him on the
1289.27s - 1294.27s |  phone. I said, hey Joe, do you have an e-reader? You do. That's awesome. Hey, what kind of e-reader
1294.27s - 1299.77s |  you got? Uh huh. That new Kindle? Yeah, right. How do you like it? Nice. Okay, so here's what
1299.77s - 1304.65s |  we're gonna do. I'm gonna, I'm gonna check in a different ILL system real quick. This one deals
1304.65s - 1309.05s |  in digital copies. And no, no Joe, I know you already look, but I'm a librarian. Let me do my
1309.07s - 1315.31s |  job. And oh my God, Joe, check it out. I found it. It's right here. No, this one library, they've
1315.31s - 1320.51s |  got it. Um, I need to contact them to see uh, see what I need to do to borrow it. But I'll give
1320.51s - 1325.39s |  you a call back in a couple days. Okay, talk to you later Joe. Bye. Beloved, did you know you
1325.39s - 1332.15s |  can scan a paperback in about 30 minutes? Uh, I took the book home and this was before I got a
1332.37s - 1337.37s |  proper book scanner. I have tools now. But I just had at the time, you know, regular run of the
1341.61s - 1347.31s |  mill, pretty decent flatbed scanner. And it was great cause you could easily fit the pages on
1347.31s - 1351.89s |  the glass uh, you know, the glass part of the scanner and push what was left of the binding up
1351.89s - 1356.75s |  against the uh, you know, up against the thing. Got some good pages. And you know, I threw in a
1356.75s - 1361.83s |  podcast and about half an hour later I had a bunch of images of pages which I could feed to
1361.87s - 1368.41s |  ScanTailor. A bit of software that I think the Internet Archive still uses for um, ingesting,
1368.41s - 1373.41s |  OCRing and converting images of pages into actual e-books. Um, it's not pretty but it works.
1376.65s - 1381.49s |  Uh, well and then after I'm done, well this patron has a Kindle so obviously I needed to use
1381.49s - 1386.57s |  Calibre to convert it to Mobi format. And 2 days later I gave him a copy of a favorite book
1386.57s - 1391.57s |  that he had not read in 30 years. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. You're far too kind. Alright,
1396.45s - 1401.23s |  this is one of my favorite stories of all time. I'll be telling this until I die. Uh, and
1401.23s - 1406.23s |  this worked because of people like what I'm looking at at here at DEF CON. In the 1990s a
1408.69s - 1415.07s |  bunch of punks made a movie. And I mean that literally. I want to tell you a story about
1415.07s - 1421.11s |  Terminal City Ricochet. This is the one, this is one of the most independent of indie films.
1421.11s - 1428.15s |  It's a punk rock counterculture cyberpunk cult masterpiece starring, well, featuring Jella
1428.15s - 1433.15s |  Biafra of the Dead Kennedys and Joe Keithley of DOA. So uh, there was this uh, there was this
1437.49s - 1442.49s |  person, I mean well let me back up. So why is this, why is this thing hard to find? Um,
1445.07s - 1450.07s |  so this, this uh, this movie was made in sunny British Columbia, which is not Hollywood. Um, it
1453.27s - 1458.27s |  has a soundtrack with some raging Canadian punk bands. And as I said in 2023, late 2023, it was
1460.61s - 1466.59s |  almost entirely unobtainable. I mean they probably printed, you know, just a few DVDs and VHS
1466.59s - 1472.19s |  cassettes and probably sold them through their friends and independent shops and stuff like
1472.21s - 1477.45s |  that. So they're just strewn to the four winds. You could not even find it on eBay. And you
1477.45s - 1482.53s |  can't pirate it because if you want to pirate something, you need to kind of have a copy of it.
1482.53s - 1489.27s |  So, one day on Mastodon, someone started asking around about this movie and they wanted to get a
1489.27s - 1495.41s |  copy of it. And that was proven to be difficult if not impossible. So, by the way, I don't know
1495.41s - 1499.65s |  if he's here, but big shout out to the Gibson for hosting, running and putting up with all the
1499.67s - 1505.91s |  insanity that is the hackers dot town Mastodon server. Um, you know, awesome, awesome work
1505.91s - 1511.85s |  there. And that's what facilitated this whole thing. This user had checked out some libraries
1511.85s - 1516.59s |  and they couldn't find it. And someone just popped up, I didn't even know who this person was,
1516.59s - 1522.29s |  popped up and said, hey, if you ask Cyberpunk Librarian, he might know a way to get it. So,
1522.29s - 1528.87s |  they checked a bunch of libraries. They had not, however, checked WorldCat. Now if you don't
1528.89s - 1535.13s |  know, WorldCat is a massive catalog of library materials and libraries all over the globe. And
1535.13s - 1540.41s |  it's run by a company called OCLC. Now, I'm not going to get into the problems inherent with
1540.41s - 1545.37s |  OCLC and modern libraries because we don't have the time and they only allowed me a shot and
1545.37s - 1552.69s |  not the entire bottle. I, but I will tell you that if you want to see if you can find something in
1552.71s - 1557.71s |  a library somewhere, your first stop is WorldCat dot org. So start there. And using WorldCat, I
1560.51s - 1565.51s |  found a copy. One single copy. And do you know where it was? No surprises. Greater Victoria
1568.53s - 1573.53s |  Public Library in beautiful British Columbia. So, uh, yeah. We're able to uh, you know, on
1574.21s - 1579.21s |  Mastodon, we're able to work with each other. And uh, you know, a little back and forth, we
1585.35s - 1591.09s |  found a Victorian local who literally lived down the street from this library. Now, this is a
1591.09s - 1598.09s |  rare piece of media, but you could check it out. And they did. And they ripped us a beautiful
1598.13s - 1603.13s |  digital copy, including the soundtrack. Um, so, you know, and they provide it for this
1607.23s - 1613.81s |  person who is doing everything they could to obtain it legally. So, there was this guy, I'm
1613.81s - 1617.31s |  sure you've not heard of him because there's librarians that might never heard of him. His
1617.31s - 1622.81s |  name was Ranganathan. I'm probably pronouncing that wrong. He wrote down the five laws of
1622.81s - 1628.55s |  library science. These are still pretty good today. And as you can see, the third law is every
1628.55s - 1633.55s |  book its reader. Or in this case, every DVD its viewer. So, within a few days, a long lost
1637.15s - 1641.49s |  movie had been re-obtained. And nowadays, strangely enough, you can view it on the
1641.49s - 1646.49s |  internet archive. Funny how that happened. Okay, circling back, let's go back to that student
1646.91s - 1654.21s |  who needed the article that their library didn't have access to. Now, there's something that you
1654.21s - 1660.99s |  need to understand about libraries and librarians in that it's kind of an insular world. We
1660.99s - 1665.99s |  know lots of other librarians. And you know what librarians love to do? They love to talk to
1668.67s - 1673.67s |  other librarians. Um, so, okay, fine. But what does that mean for the student? Well, we've got a
1674.05s - 1679.05s |  stat request for this article. They need this, the paper's due next week and oh my God. Okay, well
1681.69s - 1687.99s |  even back in the day, before, you know, all the cool internet stuff and things, a good
1687.99s - 1693.43s |  interline- a good interlibrary loan librarian, which is hard to say, could turn this request
1693.43s - 1700.07s |  around in hours if not minutes. Cause yes, there is a formal process that you have to go
1700.07s - 1705.21s |  through to request an interlibrary loan, which you can totally do after you've made a phone
1705.21s - 1710.81s |  call to your friend at the other library way over there and said, hey, I got a student that
1710.81s - 1714.95s |  needs this thing, can you give a copy of it and send it? Yeah, I'll check my email later, I'll
1714.95s - 1720.79s |  send you over the request later this afternoon. Thanks, bye! Now, while I'm not an interlibrary
1720.79s - 1725.97s |  loan coordinator anymore, um, I have worked as an interlibrary loan coordinator over the
1725.97s - 1731.51s |  course of my career. I've been in, I've actually done it for three separate times. I've been
1731.51s - 1736.51s |  on both sides of that conversation. So, these days, like I said, I work in interlibrary loan as
1739.09s - 1745.15s |  a shadow librarian. What that means is literally I'll, I'll watch Reddit, I'll watch Discord or,
1745.15s - 1750.83s |  you know, chat room, whatever, and someone needs a PDF. They don't have access to that PDF. And
1750.83s - 1755.83s |  maybe I do, and suddenly they have access to that PDF. It's very simple. Um, but, to, uh, kind
1760.03s - 1766.11s |  of, kind of move beyond even that, if you listen to podcasts or, uh, watch YouTube videos, which I
1766.11s - 1772.25s |  bet some of you do, um, you will hear someone occasionally say something along the lines of, I'm
1772.25s - 1777.25s |  a lawyer, but I'm not your lawyer. Or I'm a therapist, but I'm not your therapist. Librarians
1777.91s - 1782.91s |  are different. In a capitalistic society, the public library remains one of the few places where
1785.61s - 1790.61s |  you can go and be there, and exist in a location, and no one expects you to pay for it. I am, I
1794.25s - 1799.97s |  take pride in being part of a rare organization that can literally say, hi, I'm from the
1799.97s - 1808.86s |  government and I'm here to help and people don't laugh at me. I said people don't laugh at me.
1808.88s - 1814.64s |  But, uh, the funny thing about librarians, we'll teach you how to do our job. We'll show you how to
1814.64s - 1821.18s |  do what we do. And in essence, we kind of cut ourselves out of the, uh, out of the process. And
1821.18s - 1826.82s |  it's not that we don't want to lose you as a patron, uh, but, because we believe in education,
1826.82s - 1832.40s |  okay? Um, and even then, we'll, we'll always be there to back you up. We don't expect you to be
1832.40s - 1837.90s |  experts. Um, so if you're having trouble using the library, you can't find something, well, hey,
1837.90s - 1842.84s |  we are still there. And it doesn't matter if you're standing in a brick and mortar library, it
1842.84s - 1847.74s |  doesn't matter if you're chatting to a librarian online or trying to find something on Mastodon,
1847.74s - 1852.76s |  Discord, Reddit, whatever. So, let present me help future you. Like Liam Neeson, I have a
1858.36s - 1864.00s |  particular set of skills. Because I can offer guidance and assistance from a public
1864.00s - 1870.80s |  librarian's point of view and from a shadow librarian's standpoint as well. So, just a few
1870.80s - 1877.28s |  things to consider. If you ever need to go researching something and you need in-depth
1877.28s - 1883.38s |  information beyond what a search engine can provide. First, don't discount your public
1883.38s - 1888.32s |  library. And I'm not saying that because I want you to support your library. Folks, your tax is
1888.34s - 1894.02s |  paid for the library. You're supporting the library. You may as well go use it. It's one of the
1894.02s - 1898.82s |  few places where you can go use the things you paid for. You paid for the cop cars, go drive
1898.82s - 1909.48s |  one, see how it works. But there is one thing that shadow libraries suck at. They're just not
1909.48s - 1914.48s |  good at it at all and I love shadow libraries. Um, and that thing is browsing. Serendipity is a
1914.80s - 1919.80s |  hell of a discovery tool. Uh, for example, I write ghost stories. I have a podcast called AM800
1924.40s - 1930.92s |  WRTH and it's like a night gallery thing in that this fictional AM radio station provides a
1930.92s - 1936.72s |  delivery mechanism for the ghost story. Um, so, yeah, just the same way that the gallery did for
1936.72s - 1942.32s |  the spooky TV story. So, I popped into the, uh, Warren County Public Library in Bowling Green,
1942.36s - 1947.54s |  Kentucky. Because I wanted to find some ghost stories that I could, you know, have as maybe
1947.54s - 1952.84s |  some ticklers. Something, you know, I'm not plagiarizing, I just need ideas, dammit. And my
1952.84s - 1956.68s |  father's side of the family is from Appalachia, which now that you've heard me talk for a
1956.68s - 1962.88s |  little while, might not surprise you. And that is a culture with a wonderful richness of ghost
1962.88s - 1969.28s |  stories. And I figured, hey, I could find something along those lines. And I sure did. That
1969.28s - 1976.32s |  was easy. I mean, 133. That's the Dewey Decimal number for specific topics in the paranormal,
1976.32s - 1981.86s |  parapsychological and occultism. Uh, I didn't even use the library's catalog because I'm a
1981.86s - 1988.54s |  professional, dammit. So, I go straight to the shelf and I'm standing there with a couple of,
1988.54s - 1993.10s |  you know, a couple of shelves of, you know, ghost stories. And that's when I noticed
1993.10s - 2002.08s |  something. Wow, this one guy. Uh, William Linwood Montel. Okay. Um, he's got a hell of a
2002.08s - 2008.28s |  lot of books here. Um, right here in this section. Uh, and most all of them are about
2008.28s - 2013.86s |  paranormal stories and incidents in the state of Kentucky. What's that about? Well, you know
2013.86s - 2018.50s |  what else is in Bowling Green, Kentucky? Western Kentucky University. And if you know
2018.50s - 2023.24s |  anything about the paranormal, you might know that John Carpenter went to Western Kentucky
2023.24s - 2029.64s |  University. His father was a professor at Western Kentucky University and so was Dr. William
2029.64s - 2036.62s |  Linwood Montel. Um, this was a man that was involved in editing, writing, publishing about
2036.62s - 2043.62s |  28 books. He was a folklorist. He studied what he called the history of the common people. Um,
2043.62s - 2048.30s |  I had never heard of this guy until I'm standing in a library looking at a couple shelves of
2048.30s - 2055.30s |  books and then suddenly, I'm a big fan. Browsing a well-ordered collection of information and
2055.30s - 2061.38s |  media might not help you find exactly what you want, but you could find what you need. Um,
2061.38s - 2066.12s |  libraries are great for that and yeah, so are bookstores, but in a library you can borrow the
2066.12s - 2071.86s |  thing and pay nothing. Gather your sources. Yeah, yeah, sometimes the shortest distance
2071.86s - 2075.60s |  between two points is a search on Anna's Archive and suddenly you have an e-book that you
2075.62s - 2080.86s |  didn't have before. But you remember WorldCat? You can uh, you can set up an account on
2080.86s - 2085.54s |  WorldCat, totally free, and you can give it your zip code. And now if you want to see if you can
2085.54s - 2091.24s |  find that weird and wonderful thing that you need to read right now, you can check WorldCat and
2091.24s - 2095.38s |  it will tell you if it's any libraries that are close to you, sometimes within driving
2095.38s - 2100.38s |  distance. Um, so, not only do you want to, you know, worry about that, but you can also uh,
2100.60s - 2105.60s |  check out your library's uh, collection of databases. Um, yeah, libraries have got great
2109.34s - 2113.78s |  collections, but depending on your library, they're gonna have things like magazine and
2113.78s - 2119.62s |  newspaper databases. They're gonna have business databases, medical databases, legal
2119.62s - 2125.26s |  databases. You need forms? They probably got your forms. Hell, lots of libraries have an
2125.26s - 2130.36s |  online language learning system where you can learn a foreign language and you won't have to
2130.38s - 2137.22s |  put up with a guilt trip from a little green owl. So, you may not need any of this stuff today,
2137.22s - 2142.22s |  you might not need it tomorrow, but next week, next month, who knows? Check out other
2144.40s - 2150.36s |  libraries, online or in person. This is not meant to be an exclusive relationship. We are not
2150.36s - 2155.10s |  monogamous here, at least not when it comes to the libraries. What you do on your own time is
2155.12s - 2160.12s |  up to you. Um, but is there something your library is lacking? Okay. Check another. Back in
2164.66s - 2170.70s |  the COVID days, a library set up a thing where you could uh, sign up online for a digital
2170.70s - 2175.64s |  library card that allowed you access to the e-book, you know, e-content collections and the
2175.64s - 2180.64s |  databases and stuff. There was no charge for it. And in most cases, there still isn't. And that
2181.56s - 2186.56s |  card might only be good for maybe 6 months or so, but hey, 6 months might be all you need. If
2189.30s - 2194.80s |  you wanna get something that's, you know, more permanent, almost any library will offer you a
2194.80s - 2201.64s |  library card with full borrowing privileges for some kind of fee. Back in the shadows for a
2201.64s - 2206.98s |  moment, remember that there is a thriving e-book community in other places besides Zed
2207.02s - 2213.30s |  Library and Anna's Archive and stuff. Check out IRC. Remember IRC? Good times those were.
2213.30s - 2218.30s |  There's a couple channels there on Undernet called e-books and books. That's a books with a
2218.30s - 2223.24s |  Zed on the end of it. Um, you know, check that out. Easy to use, especially if you know how to
2223.24s - 2230.18s |  use IRC. But, outside of all of that, today I would like to offer you a fantastic
2230.22s - 2235.22s |  opportunity. I have a timeshare, no. Um, I would like to offer you a fantastic opportunity to
2239.26s - 2245.80s |  be someone else's librarian. Listen, all of you, you're, you're here at DEF CON, right? I
2245.80s - 2250.80s |  think so. I haven't hallucinated this bad in ages. Um, that means, whoops, I think I just got
2252.84s - 2257.84s |  out of that. There we go. That means that you too have a particular set of skills. You have
2260.18s - 2265.18s |  you know things and you know how to find things and you know how to do things with what you
2267.32s - 2273.86s |  have learned. You know about torrents, you know about Anna's Archive, you know how to break
2273.86s - 2279.80s |  DRM. I could have totally put in a talk topic where I stood up here, talked about how DRM
2279.80s - 2284.14s |  works on digital library materials, how you could strip that shit off and then make those
2284.14s - 2288.64s |  files available for someone else to get a hold of, you know, that may not have access to it. I
2288.64s - 2295.38s |  didn't do that because I think it'd be boring because I bet, I bet many of you already know how
2295.38s - 2300.38s |  to do that shit already. And if you don't, you can learn it in an afternoon, believe me. But
2302.52s - 2307.32s |  across the United States right now, right wing legislators and fascists, sorry, but I repeat
2307.32s - 2314.06s |  myself there, are effectively banning books and materials in libraries and schools. Is it
2314.06s - 2319.06s |  related to sex? Ban it. Anything to do with the GOBTQ community? That's gotta go. Uh, does it
2322.26s - 2327.26s |  involve a non-Christian deity? That, can't have that. Um, but it goes beyond that. Some states,
2331.74s - 2336.38s |  namely, let's see if I can do this, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North
2336.38s - 2341.38s |  Carolina, Oklahoma and Tennessee have tried to pass laws that make multiple aspects of public
2341.84s - 2346.84s |  librarianship a criminal offense. And in some states, they succeeded. In uh, in Oklahoma,
2352.08s - 2358.28s |  school and public librarians are looking at up to $20,000 in fines or 10 years in prison for
2358.28s - 2363.30s |  exposing children to obscene materials, whatever the hell that is. In uh, in uh, Montana, school
2364.02s - 2369.02s |  library and museum uh, employees face prosecution for dealing in obscene materials. Have you
2376.60s - 2382.64s |  got a renaissance exhibit coming through town? Does it have pictures of naked people? You
2382.64s - 2387.64s |  might go to jail if a kid comes to the museum. Sounds great, doesn't it? So, what can you do
2388.26s - 2393.26s |  to help? It's very easy. Share your skills, share the media. Now, you can take that however you
2402.66s - 2408.04s |  like. You might be thinking, oh, I, I see what he's saying. He's encouraging me to liberate
2408.04s - 2412.64s |  DRM encumbered materials and make sure that others can access those materials uh,
2412.64s - 2416.96s |  regardless of the capitalist bullshit, unconstitutional laws and oppressive
2416.96s - 2423.21s |  governments. And you'd be right. You, or you might think, hey, he's suggesting, I know what he's
2430.45s - 2435.65s |  saying, he's suggesting that I should scan and copy and digitize materials that aren't even
2435.65s - 2440.67s |  available online and then put them online. And you'd be correct. Um, or you might be
2445.43s - 2450.43s |  thinking, hey, I uh, I know a kid and they really need to read genderqueer. Cause they're
2456.81s - 2462.29s |  going through some shit right now, man. And uh, maybe I should get them a copy of their own
2462.29s - 2467.29s |  because their state banned that book in public and school libraries. That's good too. I'm
2468.29s - 2473.29s |  gonna close this out with a uh, with a dirty little secret about me. That's not really a dirty
2477.53s - 2489.25s |  little secret if uh, if you know anything about me. I never finished my library degree. I
2489.25s - 2494.29s |  started working in libraries uh, 30 years ago. I've never been able to finish my library
2494.29s - 2498.47s |  degree cause I'm too busy doing library work. I've shelved books, worked the front desk,
2498.47s - 2501.83s |  reference desk, children's desk, built curriculum, taught classes, installed tech, fixed
2502.29s - 2506.45s |  problems, started problems, migrated systems, abandoned systems, created workflows, created
2506.45s - 2513.33s |  databases, wrote SQL, wrote PHP, wrote documentation and wrote an entire goddamn book on how to
2513.33s - 2518.33s |  use a very specific database in a very specific library system. I did all that shit without a
2520.91s - 2529.50s |  degree. I started working in libraries 30 years ago. You can start today. You can be someone
2529.82s - 2534.82s |  else's librarian. Even if they're, even if they're your only patron. All you need to do is
2538.36s - 2543.36s |  help and share. Anything you don't know, you're allowed to look it up. Thank you for
2545.84s - 2551.48s |  listening. Thank you to Derek Brown for browbeating me into being here. Rise above my
2551.48s - 2565.34s |  friends, enjoy the rest of DEF CON. They got a thing coming up I'm sure in a few minutes. I'm
2565.36s - 2569.36s |  going to head out into the hallway if you want to ask me questions. Well, hi, I'm a
2569.36s - 2574.94s |  librarian. Um and uh yeah, I'll meet you all out there. Thank you all for coming. There's a
2574.94s - 2578.94s |  hell of a lot more of you than I thought there would be and thank you for having me.
