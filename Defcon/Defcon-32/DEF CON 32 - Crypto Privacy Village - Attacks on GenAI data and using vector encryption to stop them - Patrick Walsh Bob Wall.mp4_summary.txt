**Introduction to GenAI and Vector Encryption**
- Presentation by Patrick Walsh and Bob Wall, co-founders of IronCore Labs
- Focus on protecting data in cloud applications using **application layer encryption**

**Understanding LLMs and Their Limitations**
- **LLMs**: Trained to predict plausible completions to prompts
- Limitations include generating incorrect information and being trained on **stale data**
- Lack of training on private or corporate data

**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**
- Enhances LLMs' capabilities by incorporating relevant documents into prompts
- **RAG**: Commonly used in chat applications for improved responses
- Involves **AI search** and **vector search** techniques

**Vector Search and Text Embedding Models**
- **Vector search**: Popular AI search technique
- Differentiates meanings of words and sentences in context
- Utilizes **text embedding models** to produce **vector embeddings**

**Vector Embeddings and Their Implications**
- Consist of a list of small numbers representing meaning
- Can be used for **nearest neighbor searches** in vector databases
- **Vector databases**: Store and search vector embeddings efficiently

**Security Concerns with Vector Databases**
- Risk of vectors being reverse-engineered to original text or data
- **Inversion models**: Can reconstruct text from vectors with high accuracy
- Security of vector databases often immature, lacking proper authentication

**Encryption Approaches for Vector Protection**
- **Fully homomorphic encryption**: Allows operations on encrypted data but is slow
- **Partially homomorphic encryption**: Suitable for nearest neighbor searches
- **Property-preserving encryption**: Maintains distance comparisons between encrypted vectors

**Implementation of Vector Encryption**
- Algorithm allows encrypted vectors to function in vector databases
- **Trade-off**: Balancing security with accuracy of queries
- IronCoreAlloy: Open source library for implementing vector encryption

**Conclusion and Recommendations**
- **RAG** increases data copies, posing security risks
- **Vector databases**: Key part of data management in AI applications
- Encryption of vectors is recommended to protect sensitive data without performance penalties
