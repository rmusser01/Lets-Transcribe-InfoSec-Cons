## History of Lock Sport
- Locksmiths have always picked locks as part of their job.
- In the 1960s, the Model Railroad Club at MIT began exploring lock-picking.
- In the 1990s, Lock Sport gained popularity in Europe, especially in Germany and the Netherlands.
- TOOL-NL, the original TOOL, was founded in 2002, and LockCon, a major competition, began the same year.
- Lock Sport spread to the US in 2006 with the establishment of TOOL-US at Hope and DEF CON.

## Types of Competitions
### Lock Picking
- The primary and most popular competition involves picking standard locks.
- Participants sit at tables and are given a limited time to pick a lock before passing it to the next person.
- The person with the most opens or the best cumulative time advances to the final round.
- Winners are determined based on the number of locks opened and the speed of opening.

### Impressioning
- **Impressioning**: Creating a key from scratch without knowing its exact shape.
- Competitors start with a blank key and repeatedly insert and wiggle it in the lock to create marks that indicate where to file down the key.
- Competitions involve everyone working on the same type of lock to ensure a level playing field.
- The first round usually lasts about an hour, and the top performers advance to the final round with different locks.
- Winners are determined by the number of locks opened and the speed of opening.

### Safe Manipulation (Safe Cracking)
- This competition involves opening safe dials as quickly as possible.
- It requires a combination of sight, feel, and mathematical calculations to determine the correct combination.
- Common safe locks used include the S&G 6730, Legarde 3300, and the Big Red.
- Competitions usually allow a few hours for participants to work on the locks.

### Lever Lock Picking
- This type of competition is more common in Europe due to the prevalence of older lever-style locks.
- Specialized tools are often provided by the competition organizers for specific lock manufacturers.
- Participants work on a single lock to see how fast they can open it.

### Creative Competitions
- Events like "dozer drill" simulate prison escapes, requiring participants to pick handcuffs, jail cell locks, file cabinet locks, and even car locks.
- Other creative competitions include:
    - Forensic challenges: Picking locks without leaving marks or identifying marks left by others.
    - Freestyle events: Using any tool to open a lock without causing disruption.
    - Key duplication based on photos.
    - Under-door tool challenges: Bypassing locks to enter buildings.
    - Pick-tac-toe: A game to pick locks and get three in a row.
