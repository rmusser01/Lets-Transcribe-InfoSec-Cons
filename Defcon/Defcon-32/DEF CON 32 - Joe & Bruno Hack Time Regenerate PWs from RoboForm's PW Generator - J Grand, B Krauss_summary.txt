**Presentation Introduction**
- Joe Grand and Bruno Krauss present at DEF CON 32
- Focus on reverse engineering RoboForm password generator
- Story of helping someone recover $3 million in Bitcoin

**Hacking Time Concept**
- Reverse engineering RoboForm to regenerate passwords
- Exploit relies on weaknesses in randomness of password generation
- Other examples of hacking time: *The Time Machine*, *Doctor Who*, *Back to the Future*

**Random Number Generation Issues**
- **Pseudo random number generators**: Poorly seeded generators remain a security problem
- **Entropy source**: Needed to generate true random numbers
- **Vulnerabilities**: Using time as a seed can lead to predictable outcomes

**Historical Examples of Poor Random Number Generation**
- **Netscape Navigator**: Used time and process ID, reducing entropy
- **D-Link Router**: Generated pins via time, predictable outcomes
- **Kaspersky Password Manager**: Also used time, leading to vulnerabilities

**RoboForm Password Generator**
- Claimed to be the first password manager, popular in early 2000s
- Used by individuals, businesses, and government agencies
- Users affected prior to version 7.9.14

**Research Process**
- Conducted memory, static, and dynamic analysis
- Tools used: Cheat Engine, Ghidra, x64dbg
- Focus on identifying code responsible for password generation

**Reverse Engineering Findings**
- **System time used as seed**: Allowed regeneration of identical passwords
- **Time manipulation**: Added/subtracted a constant to prevent duplicate passwords within a second
- Built a wrapper to automate password generation

**Outcome of the Research**
- Successfully regenerated passwords from a specific time period
- Assisted in recovering Bitcoin for a client
- Highlighted widespread security issues with random number generation

**Responsible Disclosure and Vendor Response**
- Difficulty in reaching out to RoboForm due to lack of bug bounty programs
- Concern over potential legal action for disclosing vulnerabilities
- Lack of meaningful response from RoboForm regarding fixes

**Future Work and Community Impact**
- Encouragement to explore similar vulnerabilities in other software
- Release of open-source code for community use
- Emphasis on the importance of sharing knowledge within the hacking community

**Conclusion**
- Presentation highlights ongoing issues with random number generation
- Encouragement for further investigation into similar vulnerabilities
- Importance of responsible disclosure and community collaboration
