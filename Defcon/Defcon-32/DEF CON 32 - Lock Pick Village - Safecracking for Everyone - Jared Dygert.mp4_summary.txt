**Introduction**
- Presenter: Jared Dygert
- Topics: Safe-cracking techniques, **mechanical safe locks**, and their vulnerabilities.

**About the Presenter**
- **Locksport** enthusiast for nearly 20 years.
- Experience in **safe manipulation** for 15 years.
- Enjoys **gaming** and is a professional **rock climber**.

**Overview of Safe Locks**
- **Group 2** is the standard **security classification** for mechanical safe locks.
- **Group 2M** and **Group 1** offer higher security with improved resistance to manipulation.
- **Group 1R** locks are **radiologically resistant**, made from materials like **delrin** to prevent **X-ray** attacks.

**Parts of a Lock**
- **Drive cam**: Connected to the dial, it has a **cutout** and a **protrusion** (nose).
- **Wheels**: Contain a single **cutout** (gate) each, which must align for the lock to open.
- **Lever**: Arm with a nose that rests on the drive cam.
- **Fence**: Bar that falls into the aligned gates when the correct combination is dialed.

**How Safe Locks Work**
- Dialing the correct combination aligns the gates of each wheel.
- Turning the drive cam so the cutout is under the nose allows the fence to fall, retracting the bolt and opening the lock.
- Each wheel has a **protrusion** (drive pin) that engages with the wheel behind it, allowing them to move together or independently.

**Vulnerabilities in Safe Locks**
- The **asymmetrical drop-in area** of the drive cam creates a **vulnerability**.
- When the nose enters this area, the fence rests on the wheel pack, and the position of the nose determines the **range of resistance** felt on the dial.
- By measuring this range, one can identify the correct wheel positions and their corresponding numbers in the combination.

**Finding the Combination**
- Identify a **common low point** where there are no bumps or ridges on any wheels, ensuring consistent readings.
- Isolate and manipulate each wheel individually to find the correct position for the third wheel, then the second wheel.
- For the first wheel, brute force by dialing full combinations with the known second and third numbers.
- **Legar 3330**, **Diebold**, and **Sargent and Greenleaf 6730/6741** are common Group 2 locks.

**Tips for Success**
- **Precision** is key in dialing and reading the dial from the same angle and with consistent force.
- Practice with a **known combination** to familiarize yourself with the process and expected results.
- Remove the back cover to observe the internal mechanisms during manipulation.
- Utilize resources like the book, "**Safe Cracking for Everyone**," online communities, and the game, "**Sophie Safe Cracking Simulator**."
- Practice is essential; aim for at least 50 hours to develop proficiency.
