**Introduction to Sudo for Windows**
- Announced by Microsoft for Windows 11 Insider Preview in February 2024
- Provides a method for users to run commands with **elevated permissions**
- Written in **Rust** and is **open source**
- Uses **User Account Control (UAC)** for process elevation

**Architecture and Operation**
- Utilizes **ALPC service** for communication between elevated and non-elevated processes
- Involves **path resolution process** for files and relative paths
- **Three modes** of operation: New Window, Input Closed, and Inline

**Research and Security Issues**
- Conducted by Michael Torres from Google
- Discussed **memory corruption** and **search order confusion** issues
- **Cross-user code execution** and **data tampering** identified as security vulnerabilities
- **Authentication check** found to be insufficient

**Technical Details**
- **ALPC framework** is undocumented and used by Microsoft internal systems
- **Rust** requires entering **unsafe mode** for Windows API calls
- **Memory safety issues** can arise due to **unsafe Rust** usage

**User Account Control and Process Integrity**
- Normal processes run in **medium integrity**
- **Elevated processes** run in **high integrity**
- UAC is not considered a primary security control by Microsoft

**Research Outcomes and Demonstrations**
- Demonstrated **predictable RPC control port name** issue
- Showed **injection of DLL** into a controlled sudo process
- Demonstrated **cross-user execution** in a multi-user Windows system

**Public Issues and Considerations**
- **Elevation prompt** can be confusing as it doesnâ€™t specify the exact process being run
- Public **GitHub repo** allows for transparency and further research
- **Potential for memory corruption** in Rust when interfacing with Windows APIs

**Conclusion and Recommendations**
- **Sudo for Windows** expected in Windows 11 H2 update
- Encourages further research into **memory safety** and **security vulnerabilities**
- **Open source** nature allows for community engagement and improvement
