0.00s - 5.84s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 All right. Hello. Wow, that's loud. Hi, this is access control done right the first time. My name
5.84s - 12.00s |  is Tim Clevenger. A little bit about me. I'm a network cybersecurity engineer by day. By night,
12.00s - 16.48s |  I'm a low voltage hardware junkie, vintage computing enthusiast. In a previous life,
16.48s - 22.40s |  I was certified with Linnell and S2 access and video. And I got to drive around in a truck and
22.40s - 29.04s |  look at other systems available in Southern California. I'm on the Physical Security
29.04s - 33.36s |  Village Discord. My handle is NSFW. No, I will not tell you why it's my handle.
34.64s - 38.72s |  A little bit about this talk. You know, we have a lot of talks about bypasses.
38.72s - 44.64s |  My talk is more about the installation of a system. I'm looking to give some tips and tricks
44.64s - 49.92s |  based on the kind of systems that I had seen and had to work on. A lot of vendors out there,
49.92s - 54.64s |  you know, it's a low bid situation and you get a minimal viable product. You know, it kind of does
54.64s - 60.72s |  a job but it's not particularly maintainable, reliable, or even secure. I'm focusing more on
60.72s - 65.52s |  large facilities. You know, if you're a small gym with a single door, some of this will apply
65.52s - 72.96s |  to you but maybe not quite as much. Just starting off, I have an RFP based on this talk and some
72.96s - 77.52s |  other stuff that I've learned. I'll put this QR code up again at the end in case you can't catch
77.52s - 84.96s |  it right now. So choosing a system, most of the larger vendors use equipment created by a company
84.96s - 90.08s |  called Mercury Security. They're kind of the big gorilla. They have local storage and independent
90.08s - 96.48s |  processing so you don't have to worry about having to pry open your server room door if your DNS goes
96.48s - 103.04s |  down Facebook. They have multiple vendor support and they are reflashable. The cool thing about
103.04s - 107.52s |  that is if you decide you're tired of Linnell and you want to go with Genentech or Honeywell,
107.52s - 112.08s |  they can reflash the firmware on most of your existing equipment and it reduces the amount
112.08s - 118.16s |  of hardware that you have to buy to switch vendors. So a little bit about system layout
118.16s - 124.32s |  considerations. So depending on where you're going to do this installation, you'll have a couple of
124.32s - 130.16s |  different installation options. I'll start here with kind of a basic four-door layout. So this
130.16s - 135.36s |  is a typical enclosure right here. The top board is your access panel that has all the brains of
135.36s - 141.20s |  the operation. It makes all of the decisions about whether to let somebody in based on their card
141.20s - 146.40s |  number and access rights. The board below it is an additional door controller that's connected.
146.40s - 152.32s |  That additional controller doesn't have a lot of brains on its own. It will communicate with that
152.32s - 157.60s |  main panel board and that's where the decision happens. What that means is if you lose communication
157.60s - 163.04s |  between those two boards, any of those dumber, cheaper door controller boards become suddenly
163.04s - 170.00s |  very dumb. They will either lock down, lock open, or they'll just use a facility code to grant access,
170.00s - 175.84s |  which isn't always the best as far as security goes. There's an enclosure here obviously that
175.84s - 182.80s |  houses all of this. There's a power supply and then there are batteries. So when you go to place
182.80s - 188.40s |  this enclosure with your panels in it, there are a couple things to consider. Kind of the obvious
188.40s - 195.28s |  stuff like environment, heat, humidity, power, physical security. Is this going to be on a wall
195.28s - 201.36s |  that people can walk by and pry the door open on it? Accessibility. Is this going to be up
201.36s - 206.00s |  on a ceiling somewhere where maybe your batteries aren't going to get changed regularly because you
206.00s - 211.44s |  have to get out a long step ladder or something? And then the future, and I'll talk about that here
211.44s - 219.12s |  in just a second. So for wiring considerations, so the main access panel connects to your server
219.12s - 224.00s |  computer that runs the software with Ethernet typically. Ethernet as we know is kind of a
224.00s - 232.08s |  shorter range communications medium. So what they have between your access panel and your individual
232.08s - 240.32s |  door controllers is called RS-485. It's an older four-wire communications protocol. Theoretically
240.32s - 246.72s |  it's good to 4,000 feet. However, it's much more sensitive to interference than, you know, Ethernet
246.72s - 252.72s |  or some of the newer communications technologies. There's also, there's a foil shield in the wire
252.72s - 257.36s |  that you have to deal with. There's termination at the end of a string of devices. So what that
257.36s - 262.40s |  means is that RS-485 is substantially, in my opinion, as somebody who's had to go and crawl
262.40s - 268.64s |  into spaces and replace wire, it's less reliable over long distances. But we will see in a minute
268.64s - 274.16s |  there are some places that you just really don't have a choice. So next up we think about our
274.16s - 280.40s |  distances to doors. So for something like a magnetic lock or a motorized crash bar, that's
280.40s - 286.80s |  going to take a lot more amperage than just, you know, a kind of a simple relay-based door opener.
286.80s - 291.20s |  And if that door also happens to be a long way from where you want to place your panel,
291.20s - 296.88s |  then you end up with a voltage drop which causes the locks to either not unlock when you want them
296.88s - 302.80s |  to, or in the case of a magnetic lock, the magnet becomes so weak from low voltage that you could
302.80s - 307.76s |  just pull the door open anyway. And what will happen is when you go to do your installation,
307.76s - 311.84s |  the vendor will figure this out after they've already installed the door and installed the
311.84s - 316.32s |  panel and run all the wire, and they'll go, okay, well we're going to need to do a remote power
316.32s - 321.04s |  supply. And what they'll do is they'll find a place up in the ceiling nearest to the door
321.04s - 326.88s |  and put the cheapest power supply they possibly can, not having any consideration for the
326.88s - 330.64s |  environment it's going to be in. It's not going to have batteries. They're not going to tell you
330.64s - 336.24s |  where it is. It's going to be up in a soffit where when you do need to get to it, you're like ripping
336.24s - 342.00s |  out drywall or something even more expensive. So part of your system layout considerations with
342.00s - 347.28s |  your project manager is to say, okay, this door is way over here. Are we going to need a remote
347.28s - 356.14s |  power supply? If so, let's get this going now. In addition, again, hard lid. So if you've got
356.14s - 361.42s |  that drywall above your closet where you're going to be doing your installation, that's going to
361.42s - 367.42s |  affect your installation. Block walls or concrete walls, like maybe don't put this in a hallway
367.42s - 370.86s |  where you're going to have to tunnel through concrete to get all your wiring to your doors.
372.70s - 377.82s |  Integrity and security, I'm going to make sure that if I'm going to have wiring run
377.90s - 382.94s |  from my suite over here through a public hallway to this suite over here above a drop ceiling,
382.94s - 388.70s |  maybe I'll put that in conduit so it's not easy to get in either tamper with or cut or
389.58s - 395.98s |  other shenanigans. So here's one of the two kind of situations that I'm going to talk about. This
395.98s - 403.98s |  is a warehouse. We have 65, 70 doors for trucks to back into. And then every few doors you have
403.98s - 409.42s |  a person door so that somebody can get in and out of the warehouse. And you want to do access
409.42s - 415.10s |  control on these. Well, you know, we're talking 700 or 800 feet here or maybe more to go from
415.66s - 421.90s |  where your access panel might be at the far end across to each one of these drops to these doors.
421.90s - 427.42s |  So what you might do is you might go ahead and use that RS-485. It's not in a harsh environment,
427.42s - 431.02s |  so it's probably safe to use. It's going to be exposed there. So if something happens,
431.42s - 438.54s |  you can get to it. But it allows you to do this without having to run multiple Ethernet drops or
439.82s - 444.30s |  fiber with media converters or whatever it takes to get Ethernet 700 feet down that doorway.
446.86s - 453.97s |  Excuse me. Here's kind of a typical Class A office space. You know, this is a floor in
453.97s - 458.45s |  pretty much any Class A building that you'd be into. So this right here, you know, it's a
458.45s - 463.49s |  relatively small space here. What you probably want to do is a centralized panel somewhere near
463.49s - 470.29s |  the elevators where you kind of fan out to all of the doors that you need access to from there.
471.97s - 476.77s |  But something to consider for the future, you know, there might be, I don't know, a pandemic
476.77s - 483.57s |  and suddenly companies are trying to get rid of excess space because people are working from home.
483.57s - 487.17s |  So if you plan this out ahead of time when you're first moving into the space, you can say, you know
487.17s - 491.89s |  what, these are pretty much, you know, they're two half offices essentially. They each have their own
491.89s - 500.13s |  elevators, have their own entrance doors. Maybe I'll go ahead and put a panel on each side and
500.13s - 505.65s |  then RS-485 to my doors from there. And that way, if for some reason we need to get rid of half of
505.65s - 510.69s |  this floor, it's real easy to just put up some drywall, cut access to that half of the system,
510.69s - 514.93s |  and whoever moves in can handle that. So again, it's just something to consider if you're looking
514.93s - 519.25s |  at a space. Look at how you need to do it today, but also maybe look at the future.
521.46s - 527.14s |  This is a larger installation. I'm just showing this here for you. Again, power supply, batteries.
527.14s - 531.46s |  Here we have the access panel at the top with the Ethernet drop and then two door controller
531.46s - 535.94s |  boards that are below this. This is kind of, when you're talking about these centralized panel
535.94s - 542.18s |  situations, this is what you typically do. Use an enclosure. You have six or eight door controllers.
542.18s - 546.42s |  Each one can control two doors and you kind of keep them in one enclosure or two enclosures
546.42s - 551.54s |  right next to each other. The RS-485 runs are really short. In this case, it's a pre-wired
551.54s - 555.78s |  panel, so you don't even have to mess with it. And it just gives you that kind of extra security to
557.06s - 561.22s |  have that there instead of saying, I'm going to run a door controller way over on the other side
561.22s - 566.74s |  of the building. And that means that all of that wire from here to there can be a problem in the
566.74s - 572.90s |  future. Now let's talk a little bit about wiring to the doors. Some of this is a repeat if you've
572.90s - 578.98s |  seen some of the bypass stuff already, but I'll try to warp through that part because I think we
579.62s - 585.06s |  know how to bypass some of this stuff. So when you're wiring from your panels to the doors
585.06s - 590.18s |  themselves, so some of your wiring considerations, so you're going to need a power, some heavier
590.18s - 595.46s |  gauge wires to the door hardware, whatever unlocks the door. Motion sensors are going to need a power
595.46s - 600.74s |  in addition to their contacts. You're going to need some kind of shielded cable to the badge
600.74s - 606.10s |  reader. That could be RS-485 or it could be Wigan cable. You're going to have your door contact and
606.10s - 610.66s |  your request to exit wiring is going to need to go on there. And then it's a good idea to have
610.66s - 616.26s |  extra cables, extra conductors there for tamper switches, auxiliary inputs and outputs, and that
616.26s - 623.22s |  type of thing. The wrong way to do this is to let your vendors just decide because what they will do
623.22s - 627.78s |  is they will find the cheapest wire, often it's what they have on the truck, and they will run
627.86s - 633.46s |  undersized power connectors to doors they think don't need it. That could be a fire hazard in
633.46s - 639.86s |  addition to just having door opening problems. They could use unshielded splice cable. They could
639.86s - 645.62s |  use Ethernet or Cat 3 telephone wire if that's what they have access to, and that causes
645.62s - 650.58s |  communications issues. And then if they don't have those extra conductors in there, that means that
650.58s - 655.06s |  in the future if your receptionist needs a push button to be able to open the door without getting
655.06s - 660.90s |  up, I mean that could involve tunneling under the concrete or up in the ceiling or, you know,
660.90s - 665.54s |  it's a lot of extra work that you could have avoided if you had that already pre-wired with
665.54s - 671.78s |  those additional conductors. So the right way to do this is to specify composite access control
671.78s - 678.98s |  cable. So this is all together in one cable. It's produced by manufacturers who specialize in this.
679.70s - 682.98s |  It comes in multiple options depending on how many extra conductors you want,
683.38s - 688.66s |  what kind of locks you're using. It comes with the right card reader communications cable that's
688.66s - 693.78s |  shielded properly, has all the spare conductors, and then it has that thick extra jacket on the
693.78s - 697.94s |  outside. So if they're pulling it through a drop ceiling and they just grind, you know,
697.94s - 703.14s |  the cable against a sharp piece of metal, it's less likely to cause damage to the conductors
703.14s - 707.86s |  inside. It's also unique. You know, a thick yellow cable, they're not going to just go cutting
707.86s - 712.26s |  through that, you know, with, you know, willy-nilly like they might a bunch of thin white
713.22s - 719.14s |  cables. A little bit about power supplies and enclosures. So the way the power works in this
719.14s - 725.54s |  situation is typically AC or DC, 12 volts or 24 volts or accommodation of 12 and 24 volts.
725.54s - 731.30s |  Your project manager can help you pick the right system as far as voltage goes. You want to make
731.30s - 736.90s |  sure that they specify one that has a power supply with a charger. Batteries are extremely
736.90s - 740.10s |  important. The last thing you want is to get locked out of your building when the power goes
740.10s - 746.82s |  out because you didn't have batteries on this and all your doors are locked. Verify the amperage
746.82s - 750.50s |  and the temperature range. This is particularly important if you're going to be putting that
750.50s - 758.18s |  enclosure in a hot room. And then also AC fail and battery fail outputs on the power supply that
758.18s - 763.38s |  you can run back to your system and it'll alert you if your batteries are dead or if you're about
763.38s - 768.50s |  to or if you have an AC fail and it's running on batteries, it's good to catch that stuff before
768.50s - 776.06s |  your batteries die. The enclosure, you know, there are different sizes, single or multiple panels in
776.06s - 779.90s |  a single enclosure. You can also chain them together so that you can run multiple stuff in,
779.90s - 785.26s |  you know, multiple enclosures. They're typically sold as a kit with the power supply. So again,
785.26s - 791.02s |  make sure that you get that specified to what you need. You can get them pre-wired like the one that
791.02s - 796.70s |  we saw a couple slides ago or you can DIY if you want to wire your own. Make sure you get one that
796.70s - 801.82s |  has a tamper switch like you could see in the picture here and a key lock so that you can lock
801.82s - 806.78s |  that enclosure. If it's going to be in a public area, go ahead and change the lock on that because
806.78s - 811.66s |  all these enclosures have the same key. And then optionally weatherproof, if you've got a parking
811.66s - 816.86s |  lot with a gate on it way out in the, you know, at the other end of the property, maybe put it in a
816.86s - 821.90s |  weatherproof enclosure if you don't have a guard shack or someplace to install the panel out there.
823.26s - 827.66s |  And then a little bit about batteries. I cannot tell you how many times I've seen either no
827.66s - 833.26s |  batteries or dead batteries because they hadn't been changed since the system was installed.
833.26s - 838.78s |  They're right in the enclosure so they're hard to remember sometimes. Again, you have to have
838.78s - 843.42s |  a power supply with charging capability. What I like to do is write that install date on the
843.42s - 847.10s |  battery so if you're ever in that enclosure in the future, you can look at and see, you know,
847.10s - 851.74s |  how far ahead those batteries are going to need to be replaced. Typically, I do it every three to
851.74s - 855.90s |  five years. If it's in a nice air-conditioned server room, then I'll replace them every five
855.90s - 861.50s |  years. If they're out in a hot, you know, garage or something, then I'll replace them every three
861.50s - 865.34s |  years. You can usually tell because when you pick up the battery and shake it, you'll hear rattling
865.34s - 869.58s |  because the electrolytes drying up when the batteries are going dead. And again, use those
869.58s - 875.66s |  battery fail outputs. I grabbed this out of a hardware guide. Connect that and run it back to
875.66s - 883.18s |  your panels so that you can see when either the batteries are no longer chargeable or if the AC
883.18s - 889.22s |  has failed, maybe a breaker has tripped somewhere and you need to go take care of that. A little bit
889.22s - 894.66s |  about those remote power supplies. Again, for those power-hungry locks, make sure that you get those
894.66s - 898.90s |  specified out ahead of time during the planning phase. That way, you know where those are going
898.90s - 903.14s |  to go. You know they're going to be in a place that you can get to and not have to cut through
903.14s - 907.62s |  drywall. You're going to make sure then that it still has the power supply, the charger, and the
907.62s - 913.70s |  batteries. You know, having that exterior door on its own power supply with no batteries in it does
913.70s - 920.21s |  you no good because that's the door you want to get in when the power goes out. A little bit about
920.21s - 927.73s |  fire safety. Your doors, the locking mechanism on your door can be either fail safe or fail secure.
927.81s - 933.97s |  What that means is if your access system crashes and it does happen, you want to know whether you
933.97s - 938.21s |  can actually get out of the building or not. If it fails secure, then that door is not going to
938.21s - 943.33s |  open when the software is crashed. If it's fail safe, then the door is going to go unlocked. Now,
943.33s - 947.65s |  there's different reasons that people would choose a fail safe versus a fail secure depending on what
947.65s - 952.69s |  you're protecting. I would just say that if you choose to do something that is a fail secure,
952.69s - 957.89s |  make sure that people who are in that room can get out in the case of a fire, a power outage,
957.89s - 964.69s |  a software crash. It's not worth life safety to protect assets. Find another way to do it.
965.65s - 971.65s |  Make sure that your system is going to comply with the local fire code and the authority having
971.65s - 975.81s |  jurisdiction. That's sometimes a fire marshal. Sometimes it's a building inspector. It depends
975.81s - 981.09s |  on your jurisdiction. And also, if you're particularly in a class A building, you may
981.09s - 986.29s |  be required by your lease to tie your system into a building fire alarm using a relay like
986.29s - 994.05s |  one of these that opens the door or unlocks the lock when the fire alarm goes off. Again, make
994.05s - 999.57s |  sure that you take care of that. And then finally, there's a box in the U.S. at least on the outside
999.57s - 1004.93s |  of most of these buildings. It's called a Knox box. It's a little hardened metal box that the
1004.93s - 1010.21s |  fire department can open up to get a key into the building. I typically will put a badge in there
1010.21s - 1015.33s |  because I don't have keys. We don't do keys. But if you do, make sure that's in there. I strongly
1015.33s - 1020.45s |  recommend that you put a tamper switch in that so that if somebody uses the probably well-known
1021.41s - 1026.13s |  Knox box common keys out there, that you know that that's been tampered with.
1027.65s - 1032.77s |  A little bit about door hardware. I'm not going to go through these. These are pretty standard.
1033.33s - 1037.73s |  The electrified strike is the one that you see here. That's the one that makes a nasty buzzing
1037.73s - 1044.21s |  sound and the door never closes quite right. Solenoids are the more common ones that you see
1044.21s - 1049.09s |  on office doors. The only thing with those is if your door is set to stay open 8 to 10 or 12 hours
1049.09s - 1055.73s |  a day, that solenoid is staying engaged that entire time and those things can fail prematurely and then
1055.73s - 1061.65s |  you can't open the door. So it's just something to keep an eye on. Magnetic locks typically need
1061.65s - 1067.49s |  more power than standard locks because the electromagnet requires that voltage in order to
1067.49s - 1073.49s |  have the holding power. And those will always fail safe. So maybe don't use those for your front doors
1073.49s - 1078.61s |  because if the power goes out, they're going to open. And then finally, motorized crash bars,
1078.61s - 1082.77s |  which I've only seen in one place, but they're expensive, but they're pretty good.
1084.77s - 1090.21s |  So quick thing about door hardware. So you have two sensors on a door. Typically,
1090.29s - 1094.05s |  you'll have the door contact that tells you whether the door is open or closed.
1094.05s - 1100.53s |  That can be a reed switch up in the door frame. It can be integrated into the lock set itself.
1101.41s - 1106.69s |  And then the request to exit, that's what tells the access control system that this door is being
1106.69s - 1111.49s |  opened legitimately from the inside by the correct person and not being jimmied open
1111.49s - 1117.09s |  from the outside. So it detects if that door is being forced or bypassed and it still allows the
1117.09s - 1122.85s |  door to open from the secure side. There's also in cases where you have, for instance, a mag lock
1122.85s - 1126.85s |  that request to exit switch will actually unlock the door because there's not really any other way
1126.85s - 1133.89s |  to do it. And then typically, your other options are a button, a buzzer, a motion detector, or
1133.89s - 1139.09s |  a switch integrated into the handle for your Rex. The reason I mentioned these is because we need
1139.09s - 1144.37s |  to talk a little bit about supervision. Supervision is a set of resistors in series or parallel
1144.37s - 1150.21s |  that need to be as close to the door contact or Rex contact as possible. And what they do is they
1150.21s - 1156.29s |  change your situation from either these wires are open or closed, the circuit is open or closed,
1156.29s - 1161.73s |  it gives you now four different readings depending on whether the door is open, the door is closed,
1161.73s - 1167.25s |  or if the wires are cut or the wires are shorted. And that's very important because the last thing
1167.25s - 1171.81s |  you need is the door contact falling off and then people can just open the door and go in and out
1171.81s - 1179.73s |  and you don't know what's happened. Motion detectors, again, there's attack examples here.
1179.73s - 1183.73s |  We've talked about this quite a bit. You can come to Physical Security Village and we'll talk you
1183.73s - 1190.93s |  through it. They're often used to trigger and unlock, again, on motion, I'm sorry, on mag lock
1190.93s - 1196.53s |  doors and some other types. So not only do they, are they a security risk, but they can actually
1196.53s - 1202.37s |  open the door if you can bypass them. And then door handle attacks, I know that we just had a
1202.37s - 1207.25s |  presentation on this. Some of those mitigations, you know, dual Rex, so you have to have something
1207.25s - 1212.21s |  where they pull the door handle on the inside and there's a motion detector or a second badge reader
1212.21s - 1217.01s |  or a push button. Again, if you're going to use a badge reader to exit, make sure you have a way to
1217.01s - 1221.81s |  get out. Typically you get one of those plastic covers that you rip off and pull the handle and
1221.81s - 1226.45s |  they'll let you out while also setting off an alarm. That's what that's for is so that you can
1226.45s - 1232.69s |  get out in case of a fire and you don't happen to have your badge. A little bit about badges
1232.69s - 1237.17s |  and readers. So, you know, badges come in multiple sizes and shapes, you know, you got the fobs, you
1237.17s - 1241.65s |  got the smart card readers. If you're from the 80s, you got mag stripe cards, like there's all kinds.
1242.45s - 1247.33s |  Additional factors, biometrics and pin entry. This thing here is called a scramble pad. It's cool
1247.33s - 1250.53s |  every time you hit the button, all the numbers are in a different order so people watch you put
1250.53s - 1256.77s |  your pin in and they still can't figure out what it is. The badges, the most common types of badges,
1257.41s - 1263.81s |  125 kilohertz prox, that's what your gym gives you. 1356 megahertz I-class are what you typically
1263.81s - 1269.97s |  get in an office situation. They're pretty trivially broken and clonable. The MyFairDes
1269.97s - 1275.17s |  fire and the COs are not broken directly but there are downgrade attacks on those.
1276.13s - 1284.21s |  Prox and I-class, they have a facility code and a badge ID in a 26-bit format. The facility code
1284.21s - 1291.09s |  is 0 to 255 and you can buy any badges from eBay or any other vendor with whatever
1293.33s - 1297.89s |  facility code that you want. So, for instance, most of the places that I've worked,
1297.89s - 1304.45s |  for whatever reason, and this is Texas, California, Utah, the code 132 is the most
1304.45s - 1310.21s |  common facility code. I have no idea why but if you bought a batch of 132 codes or cards from
1311.09s - 1317.17s |  eBay and just walked up to a random building, you have a fair chance of getting in.
1317.89s - 1323.41s |  Again, the 26-bit prox and I-class is pretty trivial. Any compatible reader can
1323.41s - 1329.25s |  read it. So you can just go buy an HID reader off of eBay, attach it to an ESP32,
1330.13s - 1332.85s |  touch your badge to it, it'll give you the facility code and the badge number.
1333.73s - 1339.81s |  You can also do portable readers. I know we've had talks about, you know, the clipboard thing
1339.81s - 1344.69s |  where you put a badge reader in your clipboard and you just read people's badges with it.
1346.05s - 1351.65s |  So the solution is custom badges. Like I said, there are, there's the MyFair ones. I've never
1351.65s - 1358.53s |  used those. I've only used the HIDs. So they have a format, excuse me, a format called HID
1358.53s - 1364.53s |  Corporate 1000. It's CO's protected, so it's more secure. It has a dedicated facility code.
1364.53s - 1368.45s |  When you sign up, your company gets its own facility code because there's millions of
1368.45s - 1373.33s |  possibilities. And then only you can order more cards with that particular facility code.
1373.33s - 1378.85s |  They use a 48-bit format. So for each facility code, you can have 8.3 million badge numbers,
1378.85s - 1383.17s |  which is cool because you can pick a number in the high range and not worry about if you acquire
1383.17s - 1391.57s |  another company, those badge numbers coinciding with somebody else's. I'm going to warp through
1391.57s - 1396.13s |  this real quick because my time's out. Make sure you disable older formats on your readers. That's
1396.13s - 1402.29s |  the downgraded. Badge reader communications weakens the low speed protocol from 1975.
1402.77s - 1411.57s |  The mitigation is called OSDP. OSDP has very few compromises that are pretty easy to avoid.
1412.13s - 1419.49s |  The biggest problem with OSDP is that 84% of installers never or seldom use it. So it's almost
1419.49s - 1427.25s |  never used these. And this is from 2015. So what else should I do? Test your regulars. Yeah, test
1427.25s - 1432.77s |  your readers regularly. Set up alerts in your software. Again, so many people have software and
1432.77s - 1436.93s |  they've never set up alerts in it. Document everything. I put a sticker on the bottom of
1436.93s - 1441.25s |  every reader that has a number and I match that number to my access control system. So when they
1441.25s - 1447.41s |  say reader number 24 is not working, I can just go fix it. Check your batteries. Batteries die.
1447.41s - 1453.01s |  They don't do you any good. Audit your user list regularly and then come visit us in the physical
1453.01s - 1455.89s |  security village. I'm actually going to be volunteering over there right after this if
1455.89s - 1460.37s |  you have any questions for me. Thank you very much.
