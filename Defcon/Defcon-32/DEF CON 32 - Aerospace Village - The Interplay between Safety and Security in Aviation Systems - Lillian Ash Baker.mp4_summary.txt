**Introduction to Aviation Systems Safety and Security**
- Presenter: Lillian Ash Baker, a product security engineer at Boeing and Whisk Aero.
- Focus: Safety and security in aviation systems, particularly standards and certification.

**Safety in Aviation Systems**
- **Failure conditions and probabilities**: Understanding failure conditions and their probabilities is crucial.
- Based on **Advisory Circulars**: Public information that includes probability versus consequence graphs.
- **Failure classifications**: Minor (10^-5), Major (10^-9), Hazardous (10^-7), Catastrophic (10^-9 or less).
- **Design assurance levels (DAL)**: Trace failure conditions with severities and define the functional DAL assignments.

**Certification and Development Standards**
- **Standards involved**: DO-178, DO-254, DO-278, and ARP-4754.
- **Development objectives and traceability**: Requirements for code and traceability to the compiled code.
- **Verification and independence**: Especially in DAL A, requiring independent testing from development.

**Cybersecurity in Aviation**
- **DO-356A**: Defines cybersecurity development objectives for aircraft systems.
- **Intentional Unauthorized Electronic Interactions (IUEI)**: Focus on intentional attacks with unauthorized electronic interactions.
- **Safety vs. Security**: Safety addresses what and why, while security focuses on who and where.

**Safety and Security Interplay**
- **Where they meet**: In the 'how' of event occurrences and mitigation of faults.
- **SAL (Security Assurance Levels)**: Not directly tied to DAL but provides mitigation levels for threat conditions.

**System Analysis and Threat Mitigation**
- **Functional Hazard Assessments**: Analyzing how functions can be impacted across systems.
- **Mitigation strategies**: Include hashing memory spaces and adding secondary threads for cross-checking data.

**Challenges and Technological Developments**
- **Federated to integrated systems**: Transition from single-purpose to highly integrated systems and networks.
- **Networking advancements**: Introduction of faster data buses like Ethernet, requiring robust security development.

**Conclusion**
- **Importance of cybersecurity**: As systems become more interconnected, the need for strong cybersecurity measures grows.
- **Integration of safety and security**: Both need to be developed together for effective system certification and operation.
