**Introduction to Psychic Paper and E-ink Displays**
- Talk discusses using **e-ink** and **e-paper displays** to fake identification badges
- Highlights the security flaws and easy reprogramming of these systems
- **No security** measures implemented; reprogramming is accessible via a smartphone app

**Speaker Background**
- Speaker's handler: **ZittoBBGong**
- Frequent participant in **DEF CON Discord**
- 11 years of experience in the **software industry**
- Project is a **hobby**, not related to employer

**E-ink Display Applications and Prototypes**
- Focus on application of **two to three-color e-ink displays**
- Prototype of a **five-color e-ink display** for **red teaming** and **social engineering**
- Anecdote: DEF CON attendee replicating a badge using high-resolution photos

**E-ink Display Characteristics**
- **Three colors**: white, red, black
- Non-light emissive, requiring no power after programming
- Durable, reprogrammable, but programming requires **specific methods**

**Suppliers and Software**
- Software by **Hippo Inc**; APK downloadable from **Hong Kong IP**
- **Active** and **non-active** versions available; active includes USB-C
- **Reprogramming** requires specific setup and VPN usage
