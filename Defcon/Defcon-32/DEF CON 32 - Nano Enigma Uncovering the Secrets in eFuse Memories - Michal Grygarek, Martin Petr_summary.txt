**eFuse Memories and Security**

- **eFuses**: Electronic components that become permanently altered when a certain current threshold is exceeded.
- **Usage**: Protect home appliances from overcurrent; create one-time programmable memory.
- **Security**: Utilized for disabling debugging interfaces, enabling secure boot, storing encryption keys.
- **Confidentiality Risk**: Physical properties allow for easy information extraction, challenging confidentiality assurance.

**Decapsulation Techniques**

- **Purpose**: Extract silicon plate by removing epoxy housing.
- **Methods**:
  - **Thermal**: Use a blowtorch or heat gun.
  - **Chemical**: Use concentrated acids.
  - **Laser**: Vaporize epoxy material with laser beam (risk of damaging silicon).
  - **Plasma**: Use ionized gas for selective etching.
- **Chosen Method**: Chemical decapsulation using concentrated acid.

**De-layering Process**

- **Purpose**: Reveal internal layers by etching the chip's surface.
- **Methods**:
  - **Mechanical**: Inexpensive, uses wet stone.
  - **Chemical**: Involves chemical agents.
  - **Laser Ablation**: Costly, uses precise laser pulses.
  - **Plasma**: High precision, costly.
- **Chosen Method**: Mechanical etching with a wet stone and diamond lapping foil for final stage.

**Locating eFuse Memory Banks**

- **Identification**: Logical circuits, radio frequency parts, and memory types like RAM, flash, and eFuses.
- **eFuse Cells**: Appear as conductive structures with weak points, visible at 500x magnification.

**Microscopy Techniques**

- **Optical Microscopy**: Limited resolution, suitable for locating eFuse banks.
- **Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)**: Higher resolution, used for detailed examination of eFuses.

**Data Extraction and Analysis**

- **Manual Transcription**: Initial method, time-consuming, and error-prone.
- **Machine Learning Automation**: Involves image stitching, pre-processing, and object detection to extract eFuse values.
- **Model Used**: MobileNet SSD for object detection; Jetson Ajax Orion for AI processing.
- **Stitching Process**: Custom method for accurate image alignment, avoiding misalignment issues.

**Recommendations and Conclusions**

- **Storage Caution**: Avoid storing sensitive data in eFuse-based memories if possible.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Use unique keys for each chip, HSM modules, or more secure memory technologies.
- **Security Measures**: Layering increases extraction effort but does not prevent it.
- **Research Findings**: Delayering can be done inexpensively with basic tools, debunking the complexity assumption.
