 Welcome, welcome to our talk.
3.08s - 4.76s |  It's titled, hey bro, you got a lighter?
4.76s - 7.20s |  I need to do some electroporation.
7.20s - 12.24s |  So the first warning is on the DEF CON website, it's mentioned that it's like about a bio
12.24s - 15.02s |  weapon under the description.
15.02s - 16.64s |  That is not what this talk is about.
16.64s - 18.84s |  I don't know why I didn't get fixed, but.
18.84s - 23.56s |  So we'll start with saying that this device that we're about ready to show you should
23.56s - 25.48s |  not be used as a bio weapon.
25.48s - 26.48s |  Okay, cool.
26.48s - 29.05s |  Moving on.
29.05s - 33.69s |  All right, so for those that don't know me, my name is Dr. James Utley.
33.69s - 36.93s |  I have a PhD in health science.
36.93s - 39.41s |  I do kind of a lot of things in the bio.
39.41s - 44.65s |  So I'm a, I guess I'm a bio hacker doubling as a professional scientist.
44.65s - 45.93s |  And I'll just go through this real quick.
45.93s - 50.41s |  So you know that I'm not some yay who that doesn't know what he's kind of talking about.
50.41s - 54.49s |  But I think that title of being a yay who is kind of cooler anyway.
54.49s - 58.73s |  So anyway, first off is I have the honor and the privilege of being a chief scientific
59.41s - 63.77s |  officer at a, at a regenerative medicine stem cell clinic in Panama, which where I live.
63.77s - 66.29s |  So go origins.
66.29s - 70.09s |  We that's my, that's my day job.
70.09s - 76.93s |  I also were flying today under the flag of Viva Securus, which is myself, Phil Rhodes,
76.93s - 80.33s |  and Josh Hill, otherwise known as the post six ninja.
80.33s - 84.41s |  He couldn't make it here today, but he is a mystical creature that has fueled some of
84.41s - 87.41s |  the greatness behind our company for sure.
87.41s - 91.81s |  And then lastly, as I have folks here from a bio hacker collective we have here in Las
91.81s - 94.37s |  Vegas called Syndicate Laboratories.
94.37s - 97.01s |  It's a, yeah, we're a shout out.
97.01s - 102.65s |  It's an homage to the, the YT cracker album for any of those who didn't get that anyway.
102.65s - 110.81s |  So Phil, Phil is the, is the master of many talents here, pen tester.
110.81s - 115.65s |  And I don't know if there is truly like this find a fed type.
115.65s - 120.81s |  But anyway, here's one, meaning he's in the Navy, so go Navy.
120.81s - 121.81s |  All right.
121.81s - 124.33s |  So yeah, you can grab all the contacts there from the QR.
124.33s - 125.33s |  Hopefully people can get them.
125.33s - 126.33s |  Yeah.
126.33s - 127.33s |  All right, moving on.
127.33s - 129.53s |  Let's get into, oh yes.
129.53s - 131.65s |  I want to apologize in advance.
131.65s - 135.97s |  Like I don't mean to offend anyone here on this, this talk of like what we're going to,
135.97s - 142.73s |  you know, but it has been infected with like dad jokes and just, just, just some fuckery.
143.37s - 149.45s |  I, so be warned if you want me to say earmuffs beforehand, I can, but we're making this,
149.45s - 153.49s |  we kind of like, we're thinking like, hey, are we overusing memes?
153.49s - 156.45s |  And then we're like, no, no, let's just, let's just go with it.
156.45s - 157.45s |  Right.
157.45s - 161.97s |  And so you'll see anyway, moving on.
161.97s - 164.21s |  So this is where we're going to start.
164.21s - 168.97s |  So where this all started here is this is what we're, we've developed, you know, what
168.97s - 174.97s |  we've kind of like take the next generation of is, is from an electro pen, right?
174.97s - 180.41s |  So you see some of these like university students here that put together an electroporation
180.41s - 182.05s |  device.
182.05s - 186.25s |  And we'll kind of get into like, we're trying to keep this talk like very kind of simple
186.25s - 188.29s |  and easy to digest.
188.29s - 191.41s |  And so but anyway, this is where it started.
191.41s - 199.01s |  And these college kids did a great job of like really taking this barbecue lighter and
199.01s - 206.13s |  then electroporating or in transit, transfecting some, some DNA from extracellular to inside
206.13s - 207.37s |  the cell.
207.37s - 212.97s |  And that's what this, that's what this talk is, because we took their study and we made
212.97s - 218.93s |  the next, I mean, basically it's an easier device to assemble in my, in my opinion.
218.93s - 225.45s |  But the key take home point here is that we want to stress that like the, there's the
225.45s - 230.81s |  potential for, to democratize science using frugal tools.
230.81s - 236.17s |  And that's really what kind of this whole thing is about, is that you, the people can
236.17s - 239.61s |  learn about these techniques, whether it's genetic engineering, whether it's, you know,
239.61s - 245.05s |  science in general, however, however you like, be able to, to learn it from the comfort of
245.05s - 247.45s |  your own, own home.
247.97s - 251.58s |  Anyway, moving on.
251.58s - 254.70s |  And yeah, I guess I kind of started that, I started my rant already, right?
254.70s - 259.90s |  So we just like, you know, the access to electroporation technology or genetic engineering that you
259.90s - 265.18s |  can, you know, the sky's the limit and, you know, and kind of like, what is your imagination
265.18s - 269.22s |  and how to, you know, transfect cells or genetic engineering.
269.22s - 271.20s |  And this is just one way to do it.
271.20s - 277.54s |  And it allows that like those, the people can then, you know, identify like what, you
278.02s - 282.34s |  know, that they have the, the skills and the resources and the know-how to do these type
282.34s - 283.94s |  of experiments.
283.94s - 289.94s |  And it doesn't have to be confined by fancy instruments or, you know, big pharma or, you
289.94s - 295.18s |  know, or academia, just kind of like locking it up, you know, science is for everyone.
295.18s - 298.82s |  So this is just one example.
298.82s - 303.86s |  Now some of this stuff is already done in biohacker labs that are, you know, out throughout
303.86s - 305.50s |  the community.
305.50s - 308.74s |  And you know, I, I really, I really appreciate that community.
308.74s - 314.42s |  And that's why I try to invest my time and my effort into, into the biohacker community,
314.42s - 318.98s |  meaning like the genetic engineer, DIY bio, those folks, because it's important.
318.98s - 324.18s |  I know, I've noticed over like the last five years that they just become like less, I guess
324.18s - 326.42s |  maybe less organized or maybe less prevalent.
326.42s - 331.46s |  And so if you, if you have a curiosity for science, then, you know, find a community
331.46s - 332.46s |  and join it.
332.46s - 335.02s |  So for sure.
335.62s - 336.62s |  Okay.
336.62s - 341.26s |  Now this is a little bit of a, the detour here, but it's all in the same route.
341.26s - 345.18s |  So, so, so bear with me here.
345.18s - 348.78s |  Transfection is actually what we're trying to do through electroporation.
348.78s - 354.38s |  So we're trying to use electricity to develop a pore in a cell to then insert from an extracellular,
354.38s - 360.74s |  maybe that's a DNA or RNA into the cell to hijack, you know, hijack the machinery and
360.74s - 363.98s |  or express a different protein.
363.98s - 373.86s |  Now because I am a, one, a big Nicolas Cage fan, and I like the, the fact of, I like electroporation,
373.86s - 378.62s |  this presentation has been transfected with Nicolas Cage memes.
378.62s - 382.40s |  And so if you see, it's a process used in genetic engineering, you know, from foreign
382.40s - 383.40s |  into the cell.
383.40s - 391.46s |  So the challenge is here when we get to the end, that there is a number of Nicolas Cage
391.46s - 397.42s |  memes and or references and or, and I'll, I'll, I'll give you one hard one, but at the
397.42s - 402.10s |  end we'll see, we'll see if every, you know, we have a last slide here that will, that
402.10s - 407.38s |  we can see how many, how many Nicolas Cage references we have seen.
407.38s - 412.02s |  And I will also agree that Nicolas Cage's face on things is the best thing I've ever
412.02s - 413.02s |  looked up.
413.02s - 415.30s |  So, okay.
415.30s - 416.30s |  All right.
416.30s - 421.34s |  And again, I'm sorry, I'm sorry that you chose this session because there's some, some, some
421.42s - 423.54s |  terrible memes and dad jokes.
423.54s - 428.10s |  Anyway, this was, so how this all started for me personally is that I realized from
428.10s - 432.50s |  that paper that you could use a lighter to, it's not for smoking, it's for electroporation,
432.50s - 433.78s |  boration.
433.78s - 439.26s |  And so I wrote this like really cringy type sub stack post some years ago.
439.26s - 445.94s |  And with that, we're like, okay, well, let's see if we can fucking do this thing for real.
445.94s - 448.10s |  And that's where it kind of all started.
448.10s - 450.54s |  So welcome to the BioVolt revolution.
450.54s - 455.06s |  You didn't know that you were attending this talk and it's a, you know, a low cost portable
455.06s - 458.56s |  electroporator, which just means it's a barbecue lighter.
458.56s - 462.22s |  And maybe Phil, you want to show like what the device looks like.
462.22s - 467.70s |  And it's, you know, inspired by a barbecue lighter or the PZT or the PZO electric effect
467.70s - 472.10s |  of a, of a light, of a lighter to start a barbecue.
472.10s - 476.26s |  And it's meant to, you know, bring synthetic biology to the masses.
476.26s - 477.72s |  Okay.
477.72s - 479.76s |  So electroporation 101.
479.76s - 483.44s |  And I'm sorry, I'm going through this fast because we only have a limited amount of time.
483.44s - 488.14s |  So it's a technique to deliver molecules, you know, DNA into cells, right.
488.14s - 493.16s |  And it uses electropulses, right, which is the clicking of the lighter to create a pore,
493.16s - 495.32s |  which then it, then it will enter.
495.32s - 500.20s |  So sometimes when you're like, when you're trying to select, you're trying to select
500.20s - 505.68s |  what you want to electroporate or trans infect, you get kind of confused, like this is what's,
505.68s - 508.32s |  what's right, you know, DNA, RNA or whatever.
508.32s - 514.16s |  But that's part of the, that's part of the journey here because this is really part one
514.16s - 517.68s |  of really three phases of a project.
517.68s - 522.28s |  Part one, meaning that this is the tool and we're going to try to show you how we can
522.28s - 526.96s |  provide some reproducibility on the tool to electroporate or add.
526.96s - 529.32s |  And then step two is really the plasmid selection.
529.32s - 531.68s |  Like what do you want to put inside the cell?
531.68s - 535.24s |  And then the last part is like recovery and counting, which we'll kind of gloss over at
535.24s - 537.00s |  the end.
537.00s - 540.00s |  Okay, electroporation 101.
540.00s - 542.40s |  So the first thing to start with is it's not easy.
542.40s - 546.32s |  It's really difficult to do it in a DIY environment, is really difficult.
546.32s - 553.12s |  And so it's really carefully hinged on parameters, like optimizing those parameters, which means
553.12s - 557.88s |  like the gap, the amount of, you know, trigger, the pulse and those type of things.
557.88s - 564.88s |  And so the electric field, the ionic composition of the fluid in which you're putting your
564.92s - 571.28s |  DNA with to transfect the cells in which you have chosen.
571.28s - 574.40s |  So it's actually really difficult.
574.40s - 579.16s |  So if you take this home and you want to do it, just know that it's very, very hard.
579.16s - 580.16s |  But it's not possible.
580.16s - 585.56s |  And you see here I've got like a little picture of the cuvette, we call it, the cuvette.
585.56s - 590.00s |  And it has a microfluidic well, which you kind of develop.
590.00s - 594.48s |  And through the pulsing, it provides some electricity.
594.48s - 596.60s |  And that's that, right?
596.60s - 602.84s |  So again, we're going to talk about, we're going to talk about how we're taking a nucleic
602.84s - 609.56s |  acid sequence and we're trying to take it from extracellular and put it inside the cell.
609.56s - 611.64s |  And I will, this is my freebie here.
611.64s - 616.48s |  If you look at the nucleus of this meme here, nucleus cage, I don't know, hopefully somebody
616.48s - 617.48s |  finds that funny.
617.48s - 619.73s |  Moving on.
620.21s - 628.01s |  Okay, so another breakdown here, you know, you have like this plasmid, right?
628.01s - 634.21s |  So you have like your fluid in which you're, and I guess I should say that PBS or phosphate
634.21s - 637.25s |  buffered saline is really good.
637.25s - 641.49s |  And you want to, you want to add your DNA in which you've chosen, right?
641.49s - 645.77s |  With this, with your cells and give it a good pulse, you'll see on the right hand side and
645.77s - 649.45s |  by doing so, it opens up a pore.
650.17s - 652.77s |  And that plasmid will then become intracellular.
652.77s - 654.73s |  That's the ultimate goal.
654.73s - 658.33s |  That's what you're trying to do.
658.33s - 663.28s |  And yeah, so why are we doing this?
663.28s - 668.68s |  Why are we doing this is because, you know, we're all part banana and some of us are part,
668.68s - 674.00s |  you know, if you ever, and the broader point is that if you want to learn about this to
674.00s - 679.36s |  make yourself a Nicholas cage hybrid banana, like you should be able to, right?
679.36s - 680.92s |  I should tell you, you can't do that.
680.92s - 687.89s |  So you know, that's the, that's the, that's the essence there.
687.89s - 688.89s |  Okay.
688.89s - 691.69s |  So spoiler alert, the device is really ugly.
691.69s - 697.37s |  And you'll see on the left hand side of the slide there, you see, it's just a barbecue
697.37s - 703.45s |  lighter and it has the trigger, which is the, the PCT effect.
703.45s - 705.57s |  And we've kind of like optimized it.
705.57s - 710.77s |  And if you were ever wanted to look back at the college kids that did this before they
710.77s - 716.25s |  3d printed this nice housing environment that had some wires that kind of delivered.
716.25s - 721.95s |  But it was definitely difficult to, to like, you know, to make contact with the cuvette.
721.95s - 726.49s |  And really it's about like the consistency of the fluid, the micro, the micro fluidic
726.49s - 729.37s |  well or a channel, if you will.
729.37s - 732.93s |  And the cuvette that really kind of makes a difference.
732.93s - 733.93s |  You'll see there's some other equipment.
733.93s - 736.09s |  Of course, this is a pipette.
736.09s - 740.41s |  And then on the right hand side, there was like some crazy ideas like, okay, if I'm going
741.05s - 746.29s |  to put a, I'm going to try to have it migrate down a microfluidic well and then kind of
746.29s - 749.69s |  aggregate there and then, then zap it there.
749.69s - 754.01s |  No, did not really work because it just killed cells, which we'll talk about later.
754.01s - 755.01s |  Okay.
755.01s - 756.01s |  Moving on.
756.01s - 760.21s |  Because it's so ugly, you know, maybe it's the greatest threat to world peace.
760.21s - 761.21s |  Okay.
761.21s - 762.21s |  Light laugh.
762.21s - 763.21s |  No.
763.21s - 764.21s |  Okay.
764.21s - 765.21s |  All right.
765.21s - 766.21s |  All right.
766.21s - 767.21s |  We're moving on.
767.21s - 769.29s |  We were, had this like running joke about this full body electroporation.
769.29s - 773.49s |  I don't know if this movie is going to give us, if this will give us sounds, but it's
773.49s - 776.29s |  like, okay, let's, let's, oh, all right.
776.29s - 777.29s |  Okay.
777.29s - 779.89s |  And there's no sound, but you can outplay as Luigi.
779.89s - 783.29s |  Again, I already apologized up front.
783.29s - 784.29s |  Okay.
784.29s - 785.29s |  Yeah.
785.29s - 786.29s |  But back to, back to it.
786.29s - 787.29s |  Yes.
787.29s - 792.77s |  This is still a very ugly device and, but it's cheap.
792.77s - 796.81s |  That's the, that's the part it's, it's cheap to make and you can make it at your home.
796.81s - 799.01s |  It's very crude.
799.73s - 801.89s |  You can get all these, these items here.
801.89s - 806.53s |  I don't know, Phil, let's see, we didn't, we don't have the heat shrink wire insulator,
806.53s - 810.13s |  but that's like duct tape or electrical tape.
810.13s - 815.29s |  The aluminum tape is kind of a conductive material that you want to put over the magnets.
815.29s - 820.25s |  There's a roll of adhesive magnets there that we kind of stack and that kind of makes that
820.25s - 821.25s |  field.
821.25s - 827.49s |  And then you have the, the aluminum overlay that kind of is a conductive material to make
827.49s - 828.49s |  the cuvette.
828.97s - 834.21s |  And then there's like nine volt battery, kind of a, and it doesn't travel very well.
834.21s - 835.21s |  I'll say that.
835.21s - 838.69s |  They kind of wondering like, what the fuck is that?
838.69s - 839.69s |  Cause I live in Panama.
839.69s - 840.69s |  I had to travel here.
840.69s - 845.69s |  So anyway, so we made some more devices when we got back, but it's definitely cheaper than
845.69s - 849.29s |  a, and we'll see if this lands, we'll see if this joke lands.
849.29s - 852.33s |  It's definitely more than a $10 Uber Eats card you receive because of the crowd strike
852.33s - 853.33s |  windows outage.
853.33s - 854.33s |  Nobody, nobody.
854.33s - 855.33s |  Yeah.
855.33s - 856.33s |  Okay, good.
856.33s - 857.33s |  It landed.
857.33s - 858.33s |  It landed.
858.33s - 859.33s |  It already expired.
859.33s - 860.33s |  Wow.
860.33s - 861.33s |  Okay.
861.33s - 862.33s |  So I'm glad the joke landed there cause yeah.
862.33s - 864.96s |  Okay.
864.96s - 865.96s |  Again, I guess we kind of kind of talked on this.
865.96s - 866.96s |  So at one point here on this slide is this smart glass bio interface, which is a really
866.96s - 867.96s |  cool name for a microscope slide.
867.96s - 868.96s |  They seem to work well when you're trying to develop the arc gap.
868.96s - 869.96s |  So yeah, just the standard microscope.
869.96s - 870.96s |  Okay.
870.96s - 871.96s |  And, and then we also have a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
871.96s - 872.96s |  a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
873.32s - 874.32s |  a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
874.32s - 875.32s |  a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
875.32s - 876.32s |  a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
876.32s - 880.72s |  Smart Glass Bio Interface, which is a really cool name for a microscope slide.
880.72s - 885.22s |  They seem to work well when you're trying to develop the arc gap.
885.22s - 891.04s |  So yeah, just a standard microscope.
891.04s - 898.72s |  So the point here is to kind of like iterate on, find crazy devices and as long as you
898.72s - 905.16s |  can insert this PZT crystal or the piezoelectric crystal effect, then you could essentially
905.16s - 907.56s |  make it an electroporator.
907.56s - 911.32s |  And I was using super glue to like develop part of the device and I was like, hey, you
911.32s - 912.32s |  know what?
912.32s - 915.56s |  I'm going to use this like super glue casing to make another one and I put a little washer
915.56s - 919.60s |  there and then that red cap became like the spring and I was like, okay, this will do
919.60s - 920.60s |  it.
920.60s - 921.60s |  You know?
921.60s - 927.04s |  Anyway, the point is like, you know, use your imagination.
927.04s - 931.28s |  But the pro tip is that the Bic lighters, they suck.
931.28s - 934.56s |  You know, they're probably great lighters, but when you're trying to do that, trying
934.56s - 939.08s |  to make an electroporator from the device, they suck.
939.08s - 943.08s |  They suck so bad that we took a part two and we're like, okay, can we put this thing, you
943.08s - 944.64s |  know, make it a device?
944.64s - 946.44s |  And then we're like, I don't think so.
946.44s - 948.88s |  And then we were so genius that we're like, you know what we need to do?
948.88s - 952.20s |  We need to get another one and fail for the third time.
952.20s - 956.56s |  And we did and that's a pro tip, Bic lighters suck.
956.56s - 962.64s |  Again, you know, I've like talked about this, like it's the power of the voltage, right?
962.72s - 967.92s |  The piezoelectric effect from the crystal here, right?
967.92s - 974.08s |  And it's, you'll see this next couple of slides of how firing is important.
974.08s - 980.92s |  I took this, one of the words from the college kids that first did this electropen and they
980.92s - 985.96s |  said it was very reliable, you know, and I'm like, okay, so there's fair reproducibility,
985.96s - 988.20s |  which we'll get into.
988.20s - 989.20s |  But that's it.
989.20s - 993.40s |  So we have around this like 2000 volts.
993.40s - 999.60s |  This is actually a stream close up.
999.60s - 1006.72s |  Okay, well, here's another and here's another aspect or an important part of the assembly
1006.72s - 1012.48s |  here, which is the cuvette, or we were calling it earlier, the bio interface.
1012.48s - 1017.68s |  And it's, if you show that fill, you'll see that it's aluminum tape wrapped around it,
1017.68s - 1023.56s |  some adhesive magnets on top of some glass, pretty crude, pretty awesome.
1023.56s - 1028.00s |  And in the center picture here, these are kind of like some weird configurations.
1028.00s - 1033.92s |  I was like, hey, you know what, let's try to adjust the arc gap, which you'll see or
1033.92s - 1037.52s |  let's try to develop a well, see what works the best.
1037.52s - 1042.82s |  You know, they were trying to contain me, but in a cage made in Iqalus.
1042.82s - 1047.72s |  And this is the arc gap, which I think I'd say at this, when you're developing this device
1047.72s - 1052.16s |  or building this device, that actually is kind of the most important part.
1052.16s - 1054.80s |  And it is size does matter.
1054.80s - 1060.58s |  So most of the literature around electroporation on like a, like a, like a no shit commercial
1060.58s - 1064.84s |  device is around the one millimeter arc gap.
1064.84s - 1070.98s |  So you see that, but we used to really scientific indexes to kind of mess with the gap.
1070.98s - 1074.40s |  The first one being the post-it note index.
1074.40s - 1080.06s |  So if you take the post-it notes at around 10 or five and fold them in half, it gives
1080.06s - 1082.46s |  you kind of a start.
1082.46s - 1087.92s |  But then we went, we're like, hey, you know what, this is Vegas and we need another method,
1087.92s - 1090.36s |  which is the playing card index.
1090.36s - 1093.64s |  So if you start with five playing cards, gives you that nice gap.
1093.64s - 1097.60s |  But if you want to extend it out to two millimeters, just add an extra playing card before while
1097.60s - 1103.98s |  you're, while you're, yeah, when you're, as you're developing this, the, the point
1103.98s - 1109.50s |  is, you know, try it, you know, mess with it because it is important on a, on zapping
1109.50s - 1112.58s |  these cells.
1112.58s - 1114.18s |  And what lighter is the best?
1114.18s - 1116.86s |  We found that it's the Scripto Aim and Flame.
1116.86s - 1118.18s |  It's fire.
1118.18s - 1119.18s |  Yes.
1119.18s - 1121.30s |  Follow them on Facebook.
1121.30s - 1124.64s |  All right.
1124.64s - 1131.26s |  Now this is where myself and Phil decided to get a little crazy in terms of testing.
1131.26s - 1134.42s |  We wanted to look at what these college kids did in their study.
1134.42s - 1137.62s |  And then it's like, hey, let's see if we can kind of reproduce something or provide some
1137.62s - 1140.26s |  scientific value to this.
1140.26s - 1146.42s |  And but as it says on the slide, I'm not a crystal wizard or an electrician.
1146.42s - 1152.20s |  So you know, but the short of it is we zapped this thing with a high voltage multimeter
1152.62s - 1157.70s |  and we were getting some reproducibility, but it looks like we have each fire is two
1157.70s - 1159.02s |  seconds in between.
1159.02s - 1160.74s |  And then we waited two minutes.
1160.74s - 1164.18s |  And if you can see that, you know, you don't have to be a genius to see kind of a pattern
1164.18s - 1167.50s |  here that two clicks is good, then it drops off, right?
1167.50s - 1173.66s |  So it kind of decays, which has some correlation with what's on the left hand side, even though
1173.66s - 1180.38s |  there's a lot of different lighters here and this voltage curve, which anyway, so there's
1180.48s - 1183.44s |  some reproducibility is the point moving on.
1183.44s - 1185.32s |  Here's the was the raw data.
1185.32s - 1190.16s |  So you know that it's not just a terrible color chart.
1190.16s - 1193.76s |  And then we have this other setting on the multimeter called resistance.
1193.76s - 1197.30s |  And again, we're not crystal wizards or electricians.
1197.30s - 1200.76s |  So we're like, hey, let's try to hook this thing up and see what the resistance looks
1200.76s - 1204.08s |  like, meaning that we can provide reproducibility.
1204.08s - 1205.40s |  And sure enough, we did.
1205.40s - 1207.92s |  It has this nice, nice curve there.
1207.92s - 1212.46s |  So because we're trying to answer the question, is this device, does it have some reliability
1212.46s - 1217.90s |  that then you can control the other variables to actually get the DNA or the RNA inside
1217.90s - 1218.98s |  the cell?
1218.98s - 1219.98s |  And so we're saying yes.
1219.98s - 1220.98s |  All right.
1220.98s - 1225.94s |  Now we're going to play this video real quick because I'm running out of time.
1225.94s - 1229.46s |  And this is my office here in Panama, in my biohacker lab.
1229.46s - 1233.42s |  Anyway, here's a device, Phil shows it.
1233.42s - 1237.06s |  It's a click, click, click.
1237.20s - 1241.44s |  I'm going to fast forward here just a little bit.
1241.44s - 1244.08s |  And then you hook that guy up, the cuvette.
1244.08s - 1249.44s |  And if you really want to, well, again, it's hard to do and there's a lot of trial and
1249.44s - 1253.00s |  error, but you can kind of pre-chill that cuvette.
1253.00s - 1258.64s |  So then when you're adding your plasmid or your electrocompetent cells, then you're trying
1258.64s - 1262.80s |  to reduce the amount of cell death that you're, you know, you're the creator of death, death
1262.80s - 1263.80s |  of cells.
1263.80s - 1265.16s |  All right.
1265.16s - 1269.60s |  So we're going to, yeah, okay.
1269.60s - 1274.36s |  You put, that's where you're going to put the fluid, the stuff, the DNA, the cells,
1274.36s - 1277.00s |  and the phosphate buffered saline.
1277.00s - 1281.26s |  And while I'm going through this, I'll, oh, I have a little, I also have a little note
1281.26s - 1288.24s |  card because there was things I didn't want to miss around this part, which is, you know,
1288.24s - 1290.60s |  there's a recommended 2.5 microliters of DNA.
1290.60s - 1291.64s |  Like that's kind of the max.
1291.64s - 1297.34s |  If you do more of that in terms of plasmid generation, it's not very efficient.
1297.34s - 1301.02s |  You can use PBS and or sterile water, but if you have like contaminants, then it kind
1301.02s - 1307.98s |  of messes with, it'll mess with the electroporation transformation effect.
1307.98s - 1309.50s |  You're going to kill a lot of cells.
1309.50s - 1316.54s |  So this is, on this video, this is where I'm providing the inoculum or the plasmid through
1316.54s - 1319.66s |  the microfluidic well.
1319.66s - 1320.66s |  And then I'm going to buzz it.
1320.68s - 1321.68s |  Okay.
1321.68s - 1322.68s |  Good.
1322.68s - 1323.68s |  Video over.
1323.68s - 1326.72s |  But the take home point here is to make sure that you know that you're going to be killing
1326.72s - 1328.20s |  a lot of cells.
1328.20s - 1332.40s |  So and that's just, that's just the nature of electroporation.
1332.40s - 1337.28s |  I think the literature supports that like between 50 and 70% of cells are destroyed
1337.28s - 1343.72s |  in this process on these, with electroporator devices.
1343.72s - 1349.56s |  And but, but you're going to, because these, it's kind of a more uncontrolled, if you will,
1349.56s - 1351.34s |  you're going to provide a lot of cell death.
1351.34s - 1352.34s |  Okay.
1352.34s - 1353.34s |  So transformation.
1353.34s - 1354.34s |  Why?
1354.34s - 1356.50s |  What are some things that you can test this guy on?
1356.50s - 1362.18s |  You can use E. coli, electrocompetent E. coli is very, so in terms of electroporation
1362.18s - 1366.54s |  or transfection, it's a easier to do.
1366.54s - 1372.02s |  We had talked about some yeast and then me as of course being a stem cell scientist,
1372.02s - 1379.22s |  I was like, okay, let's hit it up with some stem cells now.
1379.88s - 1383.96s |  Like let's see the, the reporter marker, if you will.
1383.96s - 1387.56s |  It's really good for the green fluorescent protein or the super folding green fluorescent
1387.56s - 1391.28s |  protein is because when you incubate them, then you can see it on the, see it on the
1391.28s - 1392.28s |  backend.
1392.28s - 1398.16s |  Anyway, we're going to, you'll see this as electroporator device here on the, on the
1398.16s - 1399.24s |  slide here.
1399.24s - 1404.95s |  And of course, Nicholas, Nicholas Cage is always trying to reinvent himself, obviously.
1404.95s - 1410.03s |  Now we're getting to the last part here is the, so this is kind of after we're not talking
1410.03s - 1414.35s |  about the tool, but we're talking about the, the protocol for cloning.
1414.35s - 1419.39s |  You can see in this nice meme here that when you're, you're, you've already transformed
1419.39s - 1421.87s |  yourselves using this commercial electroporator.
1421.87s - 1426.05s |  And then of course this barbecue, barbecue lighter that we're out here, then you look
1426.05s - 1428.83s |  at the colonies and you're like, okay, there's no colonies.
1428.83s - 1432.29s |  And then you have no idea when it went wrong and then you cry and then you repeat it and
1432.29s - 1433.29s |  you adjust.
1433.29s - 1434.45s |  And that's the whole thing about science.
1434.45s - 1438.13s |  You know, you just kind of have to adjust the parameters to get it right on.
1438.23s - 1445.33s |  And if you do so, you can cross the Holy Grail and make your Nicholas Cage banana hybrid.
1445.33s - 1448.41s |  And the cell recovery is a really tough thing, which I think we're like running out of time
1448.41s - 1449.41s |  on that one.
1449.41s - 1455.01s |  But here's a short little picture of like, and this took many iterations, but if you
1455.01s - 1459.17s |  see, and I'm glad I took a good picture of this, even though not so good, you see there's
1459.17s - 1462.93s |  kind of this wave of these tiny little colonies.
1462.93s - 1472.57s |  Those graciously were conducted via the bio-volt or the electroporator pen, yeah.
1472.57s - 1475.17s |  Okay, troubleshooting.
1475.17s - 1478.77s |  Now the troubleshooting is, of course, I have talked about, there's a lot of cell death.
1478.77s - 1481.57s |  You are the destroyer of worlds when it comes to this.
1481.57s - 1485.21s |  A lot of cells are going to die, but all you need is a small portion to grow.
1485.21s - 1487.33s |  And then you're like, okay, mission complete.
1487.33s - 1491.93s |  The excessive arcing, remember some of the two methods that we said, you know, use the
1491.93s - 1492.93s |  playing card index.
1492.93s - 1493.93s |  It's really great.
1493.93s - 1498.57s |  I like, I actually like that one a lot, but you can adjust the arc and then, but you should
1498.57s - 1505.37s |  keep in mind that despite whatever prior studies or even around electroporators, that it is,
1505.37s - 1509.25s |  it has low efficiency, meaning like it doesn't work all the fucking time.
1509.25s - 1514.63s |  So you just got to know that going into it.
1514.63s - 1518.07s |  If you want the protocol, you can choose your adventure here.
1518.07s - 1521.75s |  One of these will lead you to an access point where we could provide a protocol to have
1521.75s - 1532.03s |  one build and whatever else, but it, so have a look, see.
1532.03s - 1533.03s |  And then where's my goon?
1533.03s - 1534.71s |  Am I good on time still?
1534.71s - 1535.71s |  Yeah.
1535.71s - 1536.71s |  Okay.
1536.71s - 1537.71s |  Good.
1537.71s - 1538.71s |  Yeah.
1538.71s - 1539.71s |  Okay.
1539.71s - 1540.71s |  Cool.
1540.71s - 1541.71s |  All right.
1541.71s - 1548.43s |  And now we've moved to the, the key of cage and we will pause here.
1548.43s - 1553.17s |  Oh, Uno Minuto.
1553.17s - 1554.17s |  Yeah.
1554.17s - 1555.17s |  Okay.
1555.17s - 1556.17s |  We're at one minute.
1556.17s - 1561.77s |  And uh, so if, uh, anybody have a guess how many, how many memes we got?
1561.77s - 1566.49s |  Nicholas Cage memes?
1566.49s - 1567.49s |  Send it.
1567.49s - 1568.49s |  Go ahead.
1568.49s - 1569.49s |  12?
1569.49s - 1572.49s |  That's one, two, 12.
1572.49s - 1573.49s |  Yeah.
1573.49s - 1578.41s |  No, there, there, there is a, there is, there's more than that.
1578.41s - 1579.41s |  There is.
1579.41s - 1580.65s |  Ah, you got it.
1580.65s - 1581.65s |  He's the guy right there.
1581.65s - 1582.65s |  Cause you put 20 here.
1582.65s - 1584.09s |  It's kind of like a ruse.
1584.09s - 1587.29s |  And then there was that extra one, which you must've been scanning QR codes.
1587.29s - 1588.29s |  Ah.
1588.69s - 1589.69s |  Oh.
