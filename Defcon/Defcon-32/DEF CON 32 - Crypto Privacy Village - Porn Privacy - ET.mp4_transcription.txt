 Good morning, everyone. Welcome, DEF CON.
4.50s - 7.80s |  Thank you all for being here so early in the morning with me.
9.20s - 12.50s |  This talk is Porn in Privacy. Hopefully, you're in the right room.
14.10s - 16.50s |  I do have to start because my time has already started
18.30s - 21.30s |  and I have to be done by a certain time.
21.40s - 24.50s |  So, I know some of you are still joining in
24.60s - 29.00s |  and I have to get started.
30.60s - 33.30s |  Who am I? My name is Edna Johnson.
33.40s - 36.40s |  I also go by ET. I use they, them pronouns.
37.00s - 38.90s |  I'm a cybersecurity professional
39.00s - 41.50s |  as well as a master's degree student.
42.20s - 44.90s |  I compete in OSINT CTF competitions
46.10s - 48.40s |  and I advise my friends on digital safety.
50.00s - 52.90s |  I do want to give a content warning for this talk.
53.40s - 56.60s |  I'm going to be talking about subjects that may be triggering
56.70s - 60.50s |  and if you do have any triggers regarding these issues,
61.00s - 64.30s |  I will happily share this information with you at a later time,
64.80s - 68.00s |  but I'm going to be talking about non-consensual intimate image abuse
68.10s - 72.10s |  or revenge porn, deep fakes, and sextortion.
76.09s - 78.99s |  I want to give a disclaimer that as a cybersecurity professional,
79.09s - 81.79s |  I am here sharing my technical knowledge
82.19s - 83.79s |  to make your digital life safer
83.89s - 86.89s |  and it is important to note that I'm not a mental health professional.
87.49s - 89.09s |  While I'm here to provide guidance
89.49s - 91.99s |  on matters that affect your personal lives,
92.39s - 94.89s |  I am not equipped to offer mental health assistance.
95.19s - 98.59s |  So if needed, I do encourage you to seek help
98.69s - 101.19s |  from an appropriately trained mental health professional.
103.39s - 105.59s |  Our roadmap today is I'm going to be going over
105.69s - 109.19s |  some obscenity laws that are being passed in states.
109.59s - 112.59s |  I'm going to cover NCIIA,
113.09s - 115.89s |  non-consensual intimate image abuse or revenge porn.
116.99s - 118.99s |  We're going to go over some deep fake
120.49s - 122.99s |  and then we're going to go over how to minimize the risk
123.09s - 124.89s |  of images being abused online.
125.39s - 127.39s |  And if they have been abused,
127.69s - 131.49s |  how to recover from those images when they've been leaked.
135.74s - 138.44s |  So the first thing is the obscenity laws.
138.94s - 143.64s |  States all have been passing laws
144.14s - 150.24s |  where they're requiring you to upload your government ID
150.24s - 153.74s |  to be able to access adult content or pornographic material.
154.74s - 161.04s |  And so Pornhub, for example, has been blocking states
161.14s - 165.94s |  from being able to access their website because of these laws,
166.04s - 169.54s |  because of the privacy implications that it contains.
169.94s - 174.34s |  So if you're coming from any of these eight states currently,
174.84s - 179.64s |  that is Utah, North Carolina, Texas and others,
179.94s - 182.14s |  you'll get a message from Pornhub showing you that
184.54s - 186.44s |  says basically, dear user,
186.74s - 189.54s |  if you're visiting from these states,
189.64s - 194.54s |  your government officials have this requirement to share your ID.
195.24s - 201.54s |  And that is tying your porn habits to your actual identity.
202.14s - 205.24s |  And thank you.
206.04s - 209.84s |  So that is a privacy concern.
212.74s - 214.54s |  OK. Yeah, that works.
214.84s - 216.74s |  OK, thank you. Sorry about that.
218.74s - 223.74s |  All right. So these eight states have already passed these laws
223.84s - 225.24s |  and they are in effect currently.
225.64s - 229.84s |  And so when people are accessing porn from these sites,
229.94s - 232.04s |  they're either needing to use a VPN
232.14s - 240.04s |  to access porn providers that are blocking the site
240.14s - 247.04s |  or they have providers that aren't as compliant with laws.
247.34s - 250.14s |  And so those might be a little more sketchy websites.
251.54s - 253.34s |  More states are currently passing these laws,
253.44s - 258.04s |  such as Florida just had this law go into effect on July 1st.
258.54s - 260.54s |  And these laws are typically packaged
260.64s - 266.94s |  with some kind of a child protection Internet protection bill.
267.74s - 269.04s |  So, for example, in Florida,
269.84s - 273.74s |  they have now provided a law that gives a minimum age
273.84s - 276.94s |  for kids to use social media.
277.24s - 286.14s |  And so they type that in with this adult material block.
289.78s - 290.58s |  Thank you.
291.58s - 295.78s |  So I'm going to go over some basics regarding interdigital privacy.
296.18s - 298.88s |  And a lot of you, most of you probably already know this,
298.98s - 301.88s |  but I want to make sure we all have the same fundamental knowledge.
302.58s - 305.38s |  So digital privacy refers to the protection
305.48s - 308.68s |  of private citizens' online information.
309.28s - 312.58s |  So that can be companies collecting information on users,
312.88s - 314.98s |  visiting websites, or it can be
315.08s - 317.98s |  you're sharing information on social media.
318.78s - 321.88s |  All of our activities online are going to leave a digital footprint
321.98s - 324.78s |  and that information can be used to help identify us.
326.48s - 330.08s |  Personal Identifiable Information, PII,
330.38s - 334.08s |  is information connected to a specific individual
334.38s - 337.38s |  that can be used to uncover their individual identity,
337.48s - 341.58s |  such as social security number, full name, email address, and phone number.
341.68s - 344.98s |  Make sure you're using strong account security basics.
345.08s - 348.18s |  So the basics are necessary.
348.28s - 351.98s |  And first, make sure you have strong passwords.
352.08s - 355.98s |  You can accomplish that by using passphrases,
356.38s - 361.28s |  using at least 10 or more characters in your password.
362.08s - 366.28s |  Use multiple character types, such as numbers, special characters,
366.38s - 368.18s |  upper and lowercase letters,
368.18s - 372.38s |  and then use a password manager to manage all of those passwords.
372.48s - 377.48s |  Some examples include bit warning, key pass, and one password.
378.58s - 382.18s |  Additionally, I recommend using a two-factor authentication
382.28s - 384.78s |  or a multi-factor application,
384.88s - 388.48s |  and those could be SMS or text messages,
388.58s - 391.08s |  applications such as Google Authenticator,
391.48s - 394.28s |  Microsoft Authenticator, Duo, and more.
394.28s - 398.88s |  Or you can use a hardware token such as Yubikey for your security hygiene.
398.98s - 405.33s |  So if you're creating accounts on adult websites,
406.33s - 408.53s |  try to limit the personal information
408.63s - 412.03s |  and keep personal information off of those spicy websites.
412.93s - 416.63s |  Limit the information that you share that could be used to identify you.
417.23s - 420.63s |  And I recommend using separate email addresses for activities,
420.73s - 423.43s |  so you could have a separate email address
423.53s - 425.33s |  for activities,
425.43s - 430.83s |  so you could have an email account for your personal accounts.
430.93s - 433.93s |  So if you're emailing your dad and things like that,
434.53s - 436.53s |  a different email address for your banking,
436.93s - 441.23s |  and then an email account for your spicy websites,
441.33s - 442.93s |  your adult content websites.
443.63s - 446.23s |  That way, if any of those are compromised,
446.63s - 451.63s |  you're limiting the scope of damage that can happen.
455.28s - 457.88s |  OSINT or open source intelligence,
458.48s - 461.88s |  that is the searching for and analyzing information
462.28s - 466.88s |  that is publicly available and meant to produce actionable intelligence.
467.28s - 469.58s |  And that can be found using public records,
470.08s - 474.98s |  images or videos online by finding it on websites
475.08s - 476.98s |  or social media platforms or more.
479.08s - 483.58s |  All right, non-consensual intimate image abuse, NCIIA.
484.88s - 486.68s |  Also known as revenge porn.
487.68s - 489.88s |  So non-consensual intimate image abuse
489.98s - 494.38s |  is the distribution of sexually graphic images
494.88s - 497.08s |  of individuals without their consent.
497.98s - 503.28s |  This includes images originally obtained without consent,
503.38s - 506.18s |  as well as images originally obtained with consent.
506.68s - 512.18s |  And this is usually in the context of a private or a confidential relationship.
515.38s - 519.68s |  When you've been compromised or your images have been leaked online,
520.38s - 522.48s |  you might feel like something is off.
523.18s - 527.28s |  You could have an influx of friend requests on Facebook
527.38s - 529.68s |  or lots of new followers on Twitter,
530.18s - 534.18s |  or your inboxes are overflowing all of a sudden.
535.18s - 538.08s |  So when you are finding yourself in that situation,
538.98s - 542.48s |  the first step is to do OSINT on yourself.
542.78s - 546.08s |  And you may want to find a friend to help you with this
546.18s - 549.38s |  because it could be an emotional experience to go through.
551.28s - 553.18s |  When you do find information,
553.28s - 555.58s |  you want to make sure to do online hygiene
556.48s - 560.48s |  and do checkups to make sure that you don't have information
560.58s - 563.78s |  that could make things worse.
564.38s - 567.98s |  So you want to limit the information shared online.
568.88s - 570.68s |  And you got to know what's out there
570.78s - 572.78s |  before you can start to clean it up.
577.27s - 579.57s |  Some of you may know of Caitlin Bowden.
580.87s - 586.07s |  Caitlin had her images leaked online.
586.87s - 589.77s |  And those images were from...
591.67s - 596.37s |  She had been in a relationship and the images were on her ex's phone.
597.37s - 599.87s |  And it wasn't her ex that shared them out.
599.97s - 603.27s |  It was the phone got stolen
604.17s - 608.97s |  and the phone did not have any passcode on it.
609.57s - 611.87s |  So some stranger shared out her images
612.47s - 613.97s |  and she wanted me to let you know
614.07s - 618.17s |  that offline access is only as secure as the device it is on
619.37s - 621.37s |  and that these are very special pictures.
622.07s - 623.97s |  And so conversations matter.
625.07s - 627.27s |  So make sure you have conversations with the people
627.37s - 628.87s |  that you're sharing ahead of time.
632.01s - 633.91s |  So when you're sharing your intimate images,
634.41s - 638.61s |  have those conversations with your partner or your spicy friend
638.71s - 641.01s |  about the expectations of those images,
641.91s - 643.71s |  where they can store those images,
644.31s - 648.41s |  such as on the phone or computer, any other place,
650.51s - 651.61s |  even on the cloud.
652.41s - 655.71s |  Are they able to show those pictures to other people?
657.31s - 660.61s |  Is it something that they can send to anyone else?
661.21s - 664.61s |  And do you expect them to be deleted at any certain point,
665.01s - 666.31s |  such as when you break up,
666.91s - 669.51s |  so that they're no longer in your possession?
673.21s - 674.41s |  When you're sharing images,
674.51s - 676.71s |  you want to make sure that you are watermarking them.
677.61s - 682.51s |  And that is to put a word across the image.
683.11s - 686.51s |  And you can do that both by putting the location
686.61s - 687.91s |  where those images were shared,
688.31s - 690.21s |  such as OnlyFans or Discord.
691.21s - 694.51s |  You can also put their name or handle,
695.11s - 697.11s |  such as TooHotToHandle or Dave.
697.81s - 702.91s |  And you can hide those watermarks within the image in dark spots,
703.01s - 705.61s |  like in shadows, and make them small
705.81s - 707.71s |  so that they're not really visible.
707.81s - 710.01s |  But then if they are leaked later on,
710.11s - 713.21s |  you're able to find out who was the source of the leak
713.31s - 715.51s |  or what was the source of that leak.
716.91s - 719.21s |  A lot of platforms already remove EXIF data,
719.81s - 723.31s |  but it is a good idea to remove EXIF data from your images
723.61s - 726.81s |  so that they don't contain, for example, your geolocation.
727.91s - 732.01s |  And you can create an inventory of a list of images
732.11s - 733.51s |  that you do share out,
734.11s - 736.61s |  so that you can easily reference
738.21s - 739.91s |  where those images were shared from
740.71s - 741.81s |  and who they were shared to.
742.31s - 751.31s |  So, when you do have an incident with images being shared out,
751.81s - 756.71s |  there is a website called StopNCII.org.
757.61s - 761.71s |  And with the images that have been leaked,
761.81s - 764.41s |  you can upload and create a case on that website.
765.01s - 768.61s |  And they will go through all the major platforms,
768.71s - 770.91s |  such as Facebook, Instagram,
772.21s - 773.71s |  Pornhub, OnlyFans,
774.01s - 778.71s |  and they will help you to remove the images from those platforms.
782.69s - 786.09s |  You're also able to remove those images from Google searches.
786.19s - 789.79s |  So, a lot of times when images have been released,
790.69s - 792.79s |  they will contain your personal information.
793.29s - 798.79s |  It gets added to the images
799.49s - 802.49s |  and they'll include whatever personal information
802.49s - 803.29s |  they have about you.
803.39s - 805.59s |  And so, you can request Google to remove
805.99s - 807.79s |  from the Google search results.
808.29s - 809.69s |  So, if you're searching your name,
810.29s - 815.59s |  your images that are your personal, explicit, intimate images
815.89s - 818.09s |  are removed from the Google search results.
821.71s - 825.11s |  Another process that you can do is a DMCA request.
825.71s - 827.61s |  This is using copyright law
828.31s - 832.51s |  to have images that belong to you removed from websites.
833.51s - 837.31s |  The DMCA.com website does have a section
837.41s - 840.81s |  that helps you go through the steps
840.91s - 843.81s |  of removing revenge porn from the web.
845.11s - 847.21s |  And you can find that on their website.
850.10s - 851.30s |  All right, so AI.
851.70s - 857.00s |  So, recently AI has been exploding in popularity.
857.80s - 861.40s |  And the tools are being created.
861.60s - 865.50s |  They're being created tools to abuse images.
866.00s - 870.50s |  And so, we've got AI is going to be used to change the world
871.10s - 873.50s |  as a tool to make the world better, right?
874.10s - 876.80s |  As a tool to make the world better, right?
877.90s - 882.80s |  So, there's been a lot of new apps
883.10s - 887.00s |  that are targeting, mostly targeting young men
887.50s - 891.10s |  where you can change images
891.20s - 894.90s |  to either put somebody into a bikini
895.00s - 896.90s |  or remove all of their clothing
897.20s - 899.60s |  or put somebody's face onto other images.
902.00s - 904.80s |  And these are being advertised on Instagram.
905.50s - 910.70s |  They're not in some dark corner, dark web marketplace.
910.80s - 912.10s |  They're out there.
912.80s - 917.40s |  And so, new laws are needed to be passed.
917.90s - 920.30s |  There's states that have passed laws against this,
920.40s - 923.80s |  but more comprehensive laws are needed.
929.58s - 931.78s |  All right, so tips for using OnlyFans.
933.08s - 936.48s |  When you create an account, set up a monthly charge.
936.78s - 938.18s |  Use a fake name.
938.28s - 939.78s |  Do not use your real name.
940.98s - 944.28s |  Create new social media accounts for advertising it.
944.28s - 946.38s |  Don't tie it to your existing accounts
946.68s - 948.88s |  and fake publicly available location.
951.88s - 955.98s |  To lower the risk of foreign, regionally block your state.
956.08s - 957.88s |  So, if you're from Florida, block Florida.
958.78s - 960.68s |  That way you don't have people from high school
960.78s - 962.78s |  finding your OnlyFans account.
963.28s - 965.08s |  Make sure to watermark your photos.
966.28s - 968.48s |  OnlyFans does have an easy block feature
968.88s - 970.88s |  that allows you to delete their content
970.98s - 972.68s |  after they've been downloaded.
974.78s - 977.88s |  And if there is a leak, OnlyFans actually owns the content
977.98s - 979.68s |  that you publish on their website.
979.98s - 983.78s |  So, they will send their lawyers to do the DMCA notices for you.
985.78s - 988.28s |  Make sure that you enable two-factor authentication.
988.78s - 990.98s |  There's a huge problem with accounts
991.28s - 994.68s |  that have been taken over on OnlyFans
994.78s - 997.18s |  where they set up two-factor for you,
997.98s - 1001.38s |  but they do have a support for getting control of it.
1002.18s - 1003.68s |  You have to contact OnlyFans
1004.38s - 1006.28s |  to be able to get your account back
1006.38s - 1009.78s |  after it's been taken over by somebody else.

1013.78s - 1015.68s |  So, if you think you've been catfished,

1020.88s - 1023.58s |  You may find that there's loads of other accounts
1023.68s - 1024.98s |  with many different names.
1026.08s - 1028.38s |  You can use Canary tokens or Grabify
1028.88s - 1031.28s |  to find out what their IP address is.
1031.88s - 1034.78s |  Try to verify the identity early on.
1035.28s - 1038.88s |  You can do that by doing a video call
1038.98s - 1040.78s |  or getting them to take a photo
1040.88s - 1044.28s |  with a specific sign or symbol that you request.
1045.28s - 1048.18s |  And make sure to take things slow in an online relationship
1048.28s - 1050.78s |  and don't send money to somebody you've never met.
1052.38s - 1054.78s |  Sextortion is a form of blackmail
1054.88s - 1058.28s |  where someone threatens to share a nude or sexual image
1058.38s - 1061.08s |  or video of you unless you give in to their demands.
1061.68s - 1063.28s |  It is illegal in most states.

1081.90s - 1085.10s |  and serve the blackmailer with a cease and desist notice.
