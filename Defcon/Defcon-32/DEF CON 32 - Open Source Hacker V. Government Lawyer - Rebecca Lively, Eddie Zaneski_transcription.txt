 Thank you for joining us for Open Source Hacker vs. Government Lawyer, Clashing Views on Fixing
5.12s - 6.88s |  Tech and the DoD.
6.88s - 9.84s |  My name is Eddie, and I am an open source hacker.
9.84s - 18.42s |  And I'm Rebecca Lively, I'm a government attorney.
18.42s - 25.38s |  We met at the Bravo 11 collaborative software development event.
25.38s - 30.10s |  I'm told that that's actually Bravo 3, which is some sort of weird hacker code.
30.10s - 31.10s |  It's binary.
31.10s - 32.10s |  Oh.
32.10s - 33.10s |  Binary.
33.10s - 34.10s |  Okay.
34.10s - 42.26s |  So, anyway, we met at this science fair, where a bunch of software developers got together,
42.26s - 48.14s |  and the dude running it, he had some sort of compromising material, I think, on the
48.14s - 54.90s |  general counsel, because he was able to convince all of these completely unclear, random civilians.
54.90s - 57.98s |  He was able to convince his general counsel that it was fine to bring them onto a military
57.98s - 63.20s |  base and give them access to some of the most sensitive government data.
63.20s - 66.50s |  And so, that's where I met this random civilian.
66.50s - 68.82s |  It was a hackathon, Rebecca.
68.82s - 71.42s |  And I think Stuart's here somewhere.
71.42s - 72.90s |  Hey!
72.90s - 76.26s |  So, that's awkward.
76.26s - 81.10s |  But anyway, so we were at this collaborative software development event, and we basically,
81.10s - 86.84s |  because there were these random, uncleared, unvetted people, we had to have a special
86.84s - 89.88s |  environment set up so that they couldn't screw anything up.
89.88s - 92.08s |  But good news, we had, like, literally everything y'all needed.
92.08s - 93.08s |  So, you showed up.
93.08s - 94.08s |  Yeah.
94.08s - 95.08s |  About that.
95.08s - 98.80s |  It was my first time on a military base, and I had no idea what to expect.
98.80s - 102.52s |  I showed up with my laptop, and they told me I couldn't bring it in.
102.52s - 103.72s |  Of course you could not bring that in.
103.72s - 105.84s |  Like, why did you think that you could bring that in?
105.84s - 111.36s |  Well, I said, okay, let me just get my little USB YubiKey out so I can log into GitHub.
111.36s - 113.56s |  We do not do USBs in the Department of Defense.
113.56s - 114.56s |  That is not a thing.
114.56s - 116.72s |  And also, GitHub, is that where the open source software is stored?
116.72s - 117.72s |  Yep.
117.72s - 118.72s |  Okay.
118.72s - 119.72s |  Yeah.
119.72s - 120.72s |  That's also not going to be a thing.
120.72s - 121.72s |  Well, there was no internet, so it actually didn't matter.
121.72s - 122.72s |  Correct.
122.72s - 125.40s |  There was no internet, because you were there to exfiltrate, I mean, you could have been
125.40s - 128.40s |  there to exfiltrate data, and there would have been no way of knowing that.
128.40s - 129.40s |  Yep.
129.40s - 130.40s |  Well, you built this environment.
130.40s - 132.32s |  It was a great environment.
132.32s - 135.88s |  It had literally all of the tools that developers need to do their jobs.
135.88s - 141.00s |  They had VS Code installed without any of the language plugins.
141.00s - 143.64s |  And to be clear, I'm not sure why you would need language plugins.
143.64s - 146.08s |  This is America, and we speak English.
147.08s - 151.68s |  What wound up happening was we kind of went out to the car and tethered from our phones
151.68s - 154.40s |  to get anything done at all.
154.40s - 158.16s |  I don't know if you know, that is both probably illegal, definitely unethical, and a very
158.16s - 159.16s |  bad security practice.
159.16s - 162.20s |  Well, you shouldn't have brought us there if you didn't want us to get things done.
162.20s - 164.64s |  I didn't actually care if you got anything done.
164.64s - 167.28s |  Well, it was a good time.
167.28s - 168.48s |  Anyway, time out.
168.48s - 171.40s |  We don't actually hate each other, if you couldn't tell.
171.40s - 173.56s |  I mean, we do now.
173.56s - 179.88s |  Well, Rebecca is dressed stereotypically like chat GPT thinks all women lawyers look like.
179.88s - 180.88s |  I was, anyway.
180.88s - 182.60s |  I was seconds ago.
182.60s - 186.96s |  But Stuart and his team did a great job when they put on the Bravo 3 Hackathon, so shout
186.96s - 187.96s |  out to them.
187.96s - 190.16s |  If you ever get a chance to check out the Bravo Hackathons, they're rad.
190.16s - 194.48s |  They invite civilians and U.S. citizens to come work with controlled and classified data.
194.48s - 195.48s |  Really cool time.
195.48s - 196.48s |  So they're open to the U.S. public.
196.48s - 197.48s |  So...
197.48s - 198.48s |  Go ahead.
198.48s - 202.64s |  One more thing about the Bravo Hackathon, it is literally the basis for this entire
202.72s - 205.16s |  talk, because that is actually where we met.
205.16s - 208.96s |  And he was actually having no prior government experience, and he kept asking me questions
208.96s - 212.08s |  like why the fuck are we doing this, Rebecca?
212.08s - 216.16s |  And I would provide the most reasonable explanation that I could imagine based on 13 years of
216.16s - 217.16s |  Stockholm Syndrome.
217.16s - 218.16s |  Yeah.
218.16s - 220.40s |  So, rewinding real quick.
220.40s - 221.40s |  I'm Eddie Zaneski.
221.40s - 225.96s |  I'm an open source staff engineer at a company called Defense Unicorns.
225.96s - 229.36s |  I'm a maintainer for the Kubernetes project, which is what I spend most of my time working
229.36s - 230.36s |  on.
230.36s - 231.36s |  And I don't go here.
231.36s - 232.92s |  I'm not a security person at all.
232.92s - 234.40s |  I'm just an open source maintainer.
234.40s - 237.40s |  And I definitely am very new to the government and the policy world.
237.40s - 241.56s |  So I'm about eight months into that world.
241.56s - 242.56s |  And I'm Rebecca.
242.56s - 244.56s |  I was actually a government attorney.
244.56s - 245.56s |  I am still...
245.56s - 248.56s |  Every time I tell people I'm not an attorney anymore, they think I got disbarred, and that
248.56s - 250.20s |  did not happen.
250.20s - 253.72s |  But I did stop practicing law about four years ago.
253.72s - 258.16s |  And I went to, for three years, the coolest squadron in the entire Air Force.
258.16s - 261.56s |  The 90th Cyber Ops Squadron.
261.60s - 264.04s |  And built malware.
264.04s - 266.04s |  Which was really freaking cool.
266.04s - 267.40s |  And then I escaped there, too.
267.40s - 269.66s |  Because apparently all good things must end.
269.66s - 272.32s |  And I also joined the same company that Eddie's at, which is Defense Unicorns.
272.32s - 273.32s |  Yeah.
273.32s - 274.32s |  So we mentioned Defense Unicorns.
274.32s - 275.50s |  We don't want to shill or plug too much.
275.50s - 277.72s |  But we build open source software for the US military.
277.72s - 278.72s |  It's kind of rad.
278.72s - 283.16s |  And their goal is to kind of get people like me out of industry and private sector to come
283.16s - 284.52s |  work on stuff for the public.
284.52s - 286.08s |  So check out what they're doing.
286.08s - 287.96s |  They're pretty cool.
287.96s - 290.68s |  We want to quickly define that when we talk about the term hacker here, we're talking
290.68s - 292.00s |  about the traditional sense of the word.
292.00s - 294.44s |  Again, I'm not a security person.
294.44s - 297.20s |  Building cool shit, subverting the rules, doing that type of stuff.
297.20s - 299.72s |  So that's our definition here.
299.72s - 304.08s |  And so basically we organized this talk around, like, six questions that Eddie asked me over
304.08s - 305.80s |  the last three months.
305.80s - 309.08s |  All of which, at the moment, I was like, what do you mean you don't understand why that
309.08s - 310.52s |  would happen?
310.52s - 313.32s |  And actually spurred, like, really great conversations.
313.32s - 318.24s |  But what we kind of realized is that the root of all of it is just competing priorities
318.24s - 320.52s |  within, like, the hacker community and the government community.
320.52s - 323.72s |  So we're going to start with what those competing priorities are.
323.72s - 327.88s |  In the government, and I put at the bottom, both because I'm a recovering attorney and
327.88s - 330.56s |  because I thought it was funny, terms and conditions apply.
330.56s - 335.28s |  The government, it turns out, is not a monolith that acts completely deliberately and with
335.28s - 338.00s |  one singular direction and intention.
338.00s - 343.48s |  And so how exactly these various things are rated in terms of importance to any given
343.48s - 345.48s |  piece of the federal government depends.
345.48s - 347.76s |  But we've got compliance.
347.76s - 352.94s |  So that is, like, the checking the box and validating that you meet all of the various
352.94s - 356.72s |  requirements from all of the various different parts of government and law.
356.72s - 357.72s |  There's scale.
357.72s - 361.48s |  So literally every time I had a great idea when I worked in the government, no matter
361.48s - 364.40s |  how, like, hey, I just want to try this and see if it works, like, can we just string
364.40s - 366.96s |  a couple of raspberry pies together and try this thing?
366.96s - 370.44s |  The first question I would almost always get from my leadership was, okay, but do you think
370.44s - 375.28s |  that would scale across the entire Department of the Air Force?
375.28s - 380.24s |  And I'm, like, really, like, I just I want $32 to know whether or not this would work.
380.24s - 381.92s |  Like, can I do that?
381.92s - 386.44s |  And often, like, entire projects would be killed because I couldn't articulate a couldn't
386.44s - 390.14s |  quickly articulate an easy idea of how this would scale or whether it would make sense
390.14s - 391.14s |  for it to scale.
391.14s - 392.14s |  And that wasn't just tech.
392.14s - 393.14s |  That was also policy.
393.14s - 396.20s |  So I was, like, hey, it would be cool if for these 16 people we could try this special
396.20s - 397.84s |  authority that actually already exists.
397.84s - 401.44s |  They'd be, like, ah, it would be really unfair to the other people.
401.44s - 403.20s |  So scale is a big thing.
403.20s - 407.56s |  Documentation, the ability to prove to each echelon of authority that you have done all
407.56s - 410.80s |  of the things that you're supposed to do is often, to be completely honest, more important
410.80s - 416.48s |  than anything else to the bureaucratic assholes in the government, of which they are not all.
416.48s - 421.08s |  Fairness, that's within the acquisition process, but then in general, like, making sure and
421.08s - 424.88s |  a lot of that comes from, look, I don't want to be a country where, like, if I as a contractor
424.88s - 427.44s |  install a pool in your backyard, I'm going to get the next contract.
427.44s - 430.80s |  Like, that is not how I want our country to operate as a taxpayer.
430.80s - 436.36s |  So there's a lot that's baked into avoiding, like, graft and, like, bad things and crime
436.36s - 437.36s |  and stuff.
437.36s - 438.36s |  And the last one is mission.
438.36s - 441.36s |  And I put it last because honestly a lot of times when I was in the government, it felt
441.36s - 442.76s |  like it was last.
442.76s - 446.36s |  It felt like it was the last thing in the level of importance.
446.36s - 451.52s |  But it is the most important thing to me and I think to a lot of the people in the government,
451.52s - 455.72s |  which is the other piece I'd love to touch on really quick, which is this idea of, like,
455.72s - 457.36s |  the stereotypical government employee.
457.36s - 460.44s |  So if you are not a government employee and you're in this room, you may have some idea
460.48s - 465.32s |  of, like, a suit wearing, like, kind of stodgy person who doesn't understand that 11 is actually
465.32s - 466.68s |  three and binary.
466.68s - 472.96s |  And, like, that is, in my experience, a really unhelpful stereotype for actually getting
472.96s - 473.96s |  things done.
473.96s - 474.96s |  The other part is the mission.
474.96s - 476.52s |  Like, national security.
476.52s - 478.04s |  That sounds boring.
478.04s - 479.04s |  Exactly.
479.04s - 480.60s |  Except for it's not.
480.60s - 483.04s |  Because I run my mouth, like, nonstop all the time.
483.04s - 485.52s |  I talk so much shit and I complain about the government.
485.52s - 487.16s |  And I haven't gotten shot yet.
487.16s - 488.68s |  And that is because of national security.
488.68s - 489.68s |  Because we have freedom of speech.
489.68s - 493.84s |  Because we have rights that, like, actually, it turns out, like, matter and we are willing
493.84s - 494.84s |  to defend.
494.84s - 496.84s |  So that's the government.
496.84s - 500.56s |  So the hacker side of this, obviously, as an engineer coming in to solve a problem,
500.56s - 504.16s |  a technical problem, the first thing I would care about is, is there technology out there
504.16s - 505.16s |  and does it work?
505.16s - 506.16s |  Right?
506.16s - 509.04s |  Is there something that someone built ahead of me that I can use, repurpose?
509.04s - 512.72s |  As an open source maintainer, obviously, I wish there to be an open source solution.
512.72s - 516.20s |  We all know the value of open source so I can audit the code myself, make changes, that
516.20s - 517.20s |  sort of stuff.
517.68s - 519.52s |  But I'm not a zealot when it comes to open source.
519.52s - 524.72s |  So if there is a good proprietary solution out there, I'm willing to pay for it to make
524.72s - 525.72s |  the job better.
525.72s - 529.16s |  Does it need to scale is a great question.
529.16s - 532.34s |  It's a lot of engineers when they're first going to build an architect systems, they're
532.34s - 537.08s |  worried about reaching Google scale of hundreds of thousands of requests per second, right?
537.08s - 541.24s |  I have a great friend who works for the U.S. forest department and he builds an app that
541.24s - 548.20s |  the firefighting pilots use to fight forest fires and dispatch planes and he's got three
548.20s - 553.08s |  users for his app and it is massively important to national health, right?
553.08s - 556.40s |  But it does not need to scale to a massive audience.
556.40s - 560.04s |  And then obviously I want to iterate quickly and over and over again, right?
560.04s - 563.92s |  I don't want to stick to a traditional waterfall model where I'm talking about requirements
563.92s - 565.80s |  and shipping stuff very slowly.
565.80s - 568.88s |  I want to throw shit at the wall and see if it's the right thing to solve the problem
568.88s - 572.04s |  and get feedback real quickly.
572.04s - 577.04s |  So basically as I listened to Eddie's naive questions and then answered them and realized
577.04s - 580.40s |  they were actually profound, we figured there were three main categories of questions that
580.40s - 583.92s |  he asked and so these are kind of how we organized our talk.
583.92s - 586.08s |  The first one is technical challenges in the government.
586.08s - 591.88s |  If you heard General Nakasone speak this morning, I was so delighted that he talked about buckshot
591.88s - 594.48s |  Yankee because I was like I have a slide for that.
594.48s - 596.80s |  So technical challenges in the government.
596.80s - 600.64s |  We're specifically talking about the actual technical challenges, like things that make
600.64s - 603.72s |  ‑‑ you said this better than me.
603.72s - 604.72s |  What are we talking about?
604.72s - 605.72s |  Yeah.
605.72s - 608.28s |  This is how the actual technology that we solve problems for.
608.28s - 613.28s |  So what goes into using and choosing that technology?
613.28s - 617.02s |  So one of the first things I noticed at this Bravo hackathon we went to was my partner
617.02s - 620.32s |  for the hackathon worked in a secure facility normally.
620.32s - 623.76s |  This was kind of his normal environment and he kept getting up and leaving and coming
623.76s - 626.12s |  back and he had this notebook with him.
626.12s - 629.20s |  Turns out what he was doing was he was going out to the parking lot, looking shit up on
629.20s - 634.20s |  Stack Overflow, copying code out of Stack Overflow into his notebook to bring back into
634.20s - 639.04s |  the secure room to type it into the editor to see if it worked or not and that was mind
639.04s - 643.08s |  blowing to me that this was ‑‑ sure, like we were making do with what we had, but
643.08s - 645.96s |  this was a normal thing for him to do.
645.96s - 648.92s |  Granted a lot of those facilities do have internet pipes and separate computers that
648.92s - 653.52s |  you can use, but from what he was telling me, this is his normal everyday thing and
653.52s - 654.52s |  that's mind blowing.
655.32s - 657.04s |  It's also super inefficient.
657.04s - 660.60s |  One of the questions I asked was actually, so I've worked in a lot of secure facilities
660.60s - 664.04s |  where they take all of the fun things that you have and make you do actual work because
664.04s - 666.56s |  you can't play Candy Crush on your phone anymore.
666.56s - 670.32s |  Good news, I don't work in that kind of facility anymore, but they'd never taken my
670.32s - 674.80s |  key fob before and so I was ‑‑ I kind of went down stereotype land and I was like
674.80s - 678.44s |  these people don't understand what it is they're actually screening for because my key
678.44s - 683.68s |  fob from the rental car company is not dangerous, it does not emit Bluetooth and I
683.72s - 687.12s |  almost told them that they were wrong and then I decided to shut my mouth because
687.12s - 691.00s |  usually when I feel that strongly it's actually me who's wrong and then I started
691.00s - 694.84s |  thinking like what could they be worried about and I realized a key fob comes from a
694.84s - 696.60s |  rental car company.
696.60s - 701.44s |  It is assigned to me based on random things like that you could probably Google too or
701.44s - 704.72s |  search me on LinkedIn and know what kind of things I'm there for or what kind of things
704.72s - 708.80s |  I might be there for and then at the end of my time I give it back and so if you let
708.80s - 713.36s |  that into a secure facility, you're potentially letting some sort of battery operated
713.36s - 716.72s |  device that's then going to be returned to somebody else into a facility, so like again
716.72s - 720.32s |  this is one of those examples of things that seem completely asinine that might actually
720.32s - 723.60s |  have legitimate reasons.
723.60s - 727.20s |  When I think of like the root cause of tech challenges in the government, the first one
727.20s - 734.36s |  is people, like we often lack true technical talent on the keyboard in the government.
734.36s - 738.00s |  When we're successful at recruiting them, we are not successful at retaining them, largely
738.00s - 742.32s |  because what happens is we promote them out of their technical competence areas.
742.32s - 743.32s |  People don't like that.
743.32s - 746.40s |  If you're really good at tech, it definitely doesn't mean that you want to lead a thousand
746.40s - 749.08s |  people and that like you'll also be good at that.
749.08s - 751.12s |  The next is law policy and inertia.
751.12s - 753.76s |  So law specifically, like there's all sorts of laws out there.
753.76s - 755.46s |  They're implemented by policy.
755.46s - 760.08s |  If you are at an organization at the bottom of the organizational chart, then you have
760.08s - 765.88s |  potentially like ten layers of policy between you and the law and it turns out usually most
765.88s - 768.56s |  of them get more restrictive, not less.
768.56s - 769.88s |  And then inertia is the last one.
769.88s - 775.32s |  So when I was in the legal office, I wanted to buy a fridge with government money for
775.32s - 776.60s |  $1,000.
776.60s - 778.24s |  I thought it was a reasonable purchase.
778.24s - 781.32s |  I looked up the rules and I determined that, yes, we could buy a fridge.
781.32s - 784.12s |  And so I went to the comptroller and I said, we would like to buy a fridge.
784.12s - 785.12s |  Can I have $1,000?
785.12s - 789.00s |  And he said, you cannot use government funds to buy kitchen appliances.
789.00s - 791.36s |  And I was like, can you help me understand like where you got that from?
791.36s - 795.88s |  And he pulled out a binder where he'd printed all of the regulations ten years previously
795.88s - 799.12s |  when he started his job and he had a thing highlighted in that binder.
799.12s - 802.24s |  And sure enough, ten years ago, you couldn't buy a fridge, but now you can.
802.24s - 806.08s |  So that is the inertia that an organization like the government can have.
806.08s - 808.08s |  And the last one is incentives.
808.08s - 812.08s |  There are a lot of leaders who say the right things and it feels really good to hear them.
812.08s - 815.76s |  They don't then also go and align the incentives to prioritize those things.
815.76s - 820.08s |  And so if all of the incentives are risk averse and you're saying, take risk, fail fast, but
820.08s - 825.96s |  also you might get fired if you fail, people aren't going to take risks and fail fast.
826.00s - 831.12s |  And so some of the things that I noticed coming into this world, anyone familiar with ATOs,
831.12s - 835.08s |  this concept of authority to operate, anytime you want to sell, build, or use software to
835.08s - 839.48s |  the U.S. government or inside the government, you have to do this ATO process.
839.48s - 844.00s |  It's basically a sense like hundreds of pages of NIST controls and how you implement them.
844.00s - 848.44s |  And there's an authorizing official who's responsible, and I mean responsible, for signing
848.44s - 849.44s |  off on that.
849.44s - 853.64s |  So what that means is that you have sometimes non-technical people that have to make a decision
853.64s - 857.28s |  about if the right technology is being proposed for a job.
857.28s - 862.12s |  And it kind of leads to this really painful process that some people don't want to take
862.12s - 866.94s |  on the risk because they don't understand the technology that's being proposed.
866.94s - 870.60s |  Another thing is there's lots of checkboxes all throughout the government that I've noticed.
870.60s - 873.52s |  A big one is software bill of materials or SBOMs.
873.52s - 878.24s |  FedRAMP requires that you provide an SBOM to the government if you're selling them software.
878.24s - 883.12s |  The reality is that you can provide them a blank SBOM.json file or a handwritten Microsoft
883.12s - 885.32s |  Word file, and it will check the box.
885.32s - 888.76s |  And it's not a problem, it's not like the fault of the serviceman who's responsible
888.76s - 889.76s |  for checking that box.
889.76s - 891.48s |  They're doing what they were trained to do.
891.48s - 895.48s |  It's just that that is a requirement, and that's kind of where the technical requirement
895.48s - 896.48s |  stops.
896.48s - 902.16s |  Legacy and proprietary software, you don't even know where to begin to unwind and upgrade
902.16s - 903.72s |  some of these systems.
903.72s - 905.72s |  That's how complicated it is.
905.72s - 908.90s |  And then I mentioned these NIST controls.
908.90s - 915.78s |  Hundreds and hundreds of pages of NIST controls that you don't want to have to write and think
915.78s - 919.86s |  through these controls by hand and explain how your application implements NIST 300,
919.86s - 922.06s |  1, 2, 3, 4, whatever.
922.06s - 926.10s |  And it gets real frustrating when you are brought on to write code and not documentation
926.10s - 928.46s |  like this.
928.46s - 930.14s |  So how do we fix it?
930.14s - 934.10s |  First one is prioritizing technical depth.
934.10s - 938.98s |  There is a world where you can have no technical skills whatsoever and promote and promote
938.98s - 943.62s |  and promote and be the technically best in the world at something and literally not get
943.62s - 946.86s |  promoted within the government because you don't meet whatever leadership criteria or
946.86s - 949.06s |  whatever other things that they think that you need.
949.06s - 950.06s |  Yeah.
950.06s - 952.74s |  And the other part of this I've learned is that there is no actual career track to being
952.74s - 959.30s |  a software engineer in the military, and that frustrates lots of people from what I've heard.
959.30s - 961.30s |  Next is improving hiring and firing speed.
961.30s - 966.78s |  It turns out it's hard to fire people in the federal government.
966.78s - 970.46s |  And that makes people really uncomfortable about hiring people because you want to make
970.46s - 974.74s |  sure that you don't get the wrong person and they get stuck with them for the rest of time.
974.74s - 979.26s |  There are things that can be done both within existing law and policy, but also by potentially
979.26s - 983.54s |  modifying some existing law and policy to make both of those processes faster, and I
983.54s - 988.58s |  think it is essential to compete for tech because I have not met a single outstanding
988.66s - 992.90s |  software developer type who is really comfortable with the idea of waiting six to eight months for
992.90s - 993.78s |  their final job offer.
995.38s - 996.98s |  Oh, and I'm supposed to do the next one, too.
996.98s - 1000.26s |  Aligning and setting priorities, that just comes back to, look, if you say that failing
1000.26s - 1004.10s |  fast and iterating and all of those things is important, then you need to also make that
1004.90s - 1008.66s |  what gets you promoted, not something that is a risk that you take that actually affects
1008.66s - 1009.46s |  your career.
1009.46s - 1009.78s |  Yeah.
1009.78s - 1013.38s |  And in automating a lot of that compliance documentation, we need to find ways to produce
1013.38s - 1018.98s |  that with policy code, with actual software policy, where people aren't sitting there
1018.98s - 1023.38s |  reading NIST manuals forever and then having to write up their implementation by hand every
1023.38s - 1023.94s |  time.
1023.94s - 1024.66s |  Super frustrating.
1024.66s - 1026.18s |  So we need to find ways to automate that.
1027.46s - 1032.18s |  Budget and organizational inefficiencies, we kind of think about this as the money and
1032.18s - 1036.58s |  the people side of it, and this is a lovely org chart of DoD stuff.
1037.54s - 1042.34s |  This is an org chart of DoD cyber, and it illustrates why I think it's so effective.
1042.98s - 1047.78s |  So one of the things I learned is I went to an Air Force conference, and the Air Force
1047.78s - 1052.42s |  PKI office had a table there in the vendor hall, and I quickly learned that every single
1052.42s - 1058.50s |  branch of the DoD has their own PKI audit, I mean, login, authentication, DNS.
1058.50s - 1061.38s |  They're providing all of these things, and they're not building them themselves.
1061.38s - 1062.66s |  A contractor is building that.
1062.66s - 1066.90s |  So some contractor is getting paid to build the same thing six times, the same way to
1066.90s - 1071.46s |  solve the same requirements from scratch, and as a taxpayer, that's frustrating.
1072.34s - 1076.10s |  I always thought that this was all provided at the DoD service level, and everyone used
1076.10s - 1079.14s |  this like any other sort of business organization out there.
1081.06s - 1086.26s |  The next one is, so everyone I know who's left the government has a handful of stories
1086.26s - 1089.70s |  that they will tell when someone asks them, like, what was your moment when you decided
1089.70s - 1091.14s |  that it was time for you to leave the government?
1092.18s - 1096.18s |  I have a few, and this is one of mine, and essentially, I like how you're looking at
1096.18s - 1097.62s |  me right now, because you know this story.
1098.58s - 1102.98s |  Essentially, we tried to do an experiment where we took money that would normally go
1102.98s - 1107.38s |  to an acquisition organization, instead we gave it to an operational organization, and
1107.38s - 1113.30s |  we got $2 million, we met the customer requirement in six months instead of a year, and we spent
1113.30s - 1117.06s |  only $500,000 instead of $2 million, and I was super stoked about this.
1117.06s - 1123.62s |  I thought we had made, I thought it was like an unmitigated success, and so we're talking
1123.70s - 1127.86s |  about, like, we're trying to use this as an example, and the acquisition people got
1127.86s - 1133.38s |  to talk first, and they said, yeah, that experiment was a total failure, and I was, my face did
1133.38s - 1136.74s |  this thing in the meeting where it made everyone kind of look at me, because apparently it
1136.74s - 1140.82s |  was a facial expression that you're not supposed to make, and I was like, I don't understand,
1140.82s - 1145.06s |  like, help me out here, and it was a complete failure, because we had not spent all of the
1145.06s - 1150.10s |  money within the timeline expected, and I was pissed, so in case you were wondering,
1150.10s - 1150.82s |  I was pissed.
1150.82s - 1153.70s |  So what causes it?
1153.70s - 1155.78s |  One of the things I heard, are there any lawyers in the room?
1158.06s - 1161.58s |  Okay, and you don't have to, oh, perfect, yeah, the lawyers in the room are afraid,
1161.58s - 1165.10s |  and I understand that, like, don't actually raise your hand, but just listen carefully
1165.10s - 1166.22s |  and let this resonate with you.
1166.94s - 1169.74s |  One of the things that my clients would say to me that made me want to punch them in the
1169.74s - 1173.98s |  face was I do not look good in orange, basically, Rebecca, don't let me go to jail, and when
1173.98s - 1177.18s |  they meant it earnestly, I did not want to punch them in the face, but often, like, they
1177.18s - 1181.74s |  thought it was funny, and they didn't realize I'd heard it 6,000 times that same day, but
1181.74s - 1185.58s |  it is an interesting concept, because there aren't a lot of jobs in the private sector
1185.58s - 1189.50s |  where you can literally go to jail if you do your job wrong, but also in good faith.
1190.30s - 1192.70s |  That being said, a lot of people don't go to jail for this sort of stuff, but there
1192.70s - 1195.90s |  are rules, so the Anti-Deficiency Act is a great example, it is a federal law, it is
1195.90s - 1200.62s |  a criminal statute, and it basically says if you accidentally spend money wrong, you
1200.62s - 1204.70s |  go to jail, or you could, at least, or be fined, or, like, all sorts of other things,
1204.70s - 1209.50s |  so the federal government is full of really scary things that can happen to you if you
1209.50s - 1212.94s |  screw up your job, and also it usually doesn't pay enough to take on that level of risk.
1213.82s - 1218.06s |  Not invented here, I think this is a pervasive problem, not just in the government, but also
1218.06s - 1221.58s |  it's definitely a problem in the government, so it's this idea that, like, look, I don't,
1221.58s - 1225.58s |  maybe this other organization is doing it so much better, I don't really care, I don't
1225.58s - 1229.18s |  really want to go down that path, we built this, we know what it is, we know how it works,
1229.18s - 1231.50s |  we've been using it for ten years, we're going to keep doing it.
1232.14s - 1233.98s |  The next one is no one ever asks for less.
1233.98s - 1236.46s |  This is another thing when I was listening to General Nakastony this morning, he was
1236.46s - 1241.18s |  talking about how, like, we need more people, we need more funds, and I felt like he set
1241.18s - 1241.90s |  me up for this.
1241.90s - 1246.62s |  We actually don't necessarily need more, but also no one's ever going to ask for less,
1246.62s - 1249.10s |  so, like, when the Congress rolls through, like, what can we do to help?
1249.10s - 1252.06s |  Well, we're going to need more people and more funds, and so we add, and we add, and
1252.06s - 1256.14s |  we add, and the government gets bigger and more complex, and then the last one is the
1256.14s - 1259.58s |  appropriations bills each year are getting passed later and later and later, which means
1259.58s - 1264.86s |  you end up in this situation where the money actually shows up, this is just a weird government
1264.86s - 1267.42s |  thing because money is weird in the government.
1267.42s - 1271.10s |  Like, so the money shows up, and you have three months to spend it because you need
1271.10s - 1274.22s |  to spend it three months in advance of the end of the fiscal year, and it's a nightmare
1275.42s - 1277.58s |  for so many reasons that you can probably figure out on your own.
1279.34s - 1282.14s |  Time is valuable, I think we've got to start speed running this.
1282.86s - 1285.74s |  Time is valuable, yes, we're going to move on.
1286.70s - 1292.38s |  It took three months to get a three-month contract signed and started, that's the story
1292.38s - 1293.26s |  I have there, it was awful.
1294.14s - 1297.66s |  Tech talent is expensive, it's real hard to get people to go from making a ton of money
1297.66s - 1301.58s |  at a Google or an Amazon and ask them to take a pay cut to come do civil service and work
1301.58s - 1305.26s |  for the DOD, they just can't compete.
1305.26s - 1309.66s |  Selling to the government is absolutely a pain, you know, there's a lot of requirements
1309.66s - 1314.06s |  that you have to fill out, it's kind of like a decision you have to make as a company where
1314.06s - 1319.26s |  once you've kind of had a bigger adoption from the consumer world, and you're like,
1319.26s - 1322.54s |  okay, we can turn to the government, and then someone tells you that, oh, you can sell the
1322.54s - 1325.82s |  same thing to the government six different times, you can make a lot of money doing that,
1325.82s - 1327.66s |  and then you kind of prioritize that, right?
1328.94s - 1333.26s |  So some of the suggestions we have, we want to be able to create incentives for technical
1333.26s - 1334.54s |  experts to join and stay.
1334.54s - 1338.78s |  And the answer there is not necessarily more money, it's probably one of the most trite
1338.78s - 1342.14s |  examples I've heard people say, oh, we can't pay enough, so we're never going to succeed,
1343.02s - 1346.94s |  especially once you've successfully recruited someone, you're already paying enough, so
1346.94s - 1350.22s |  then there's other ways to get them to stay, and it's not usually money, I'm not saying
1350.22s - 1353.98s |  money doesn't help, and some organizations like CISA, for example, have done incredible
1353.98s - 1358.46s |  things at raising the actual pay for technical contributors, and also the 90th has done a
1358.46s - 1359.02s |  great job too.
1359.02s - 1363.66s |  Yeah, this use it or lose it financial policy is really frustrating to hear, that if you
1363.66s - 1367.74s |  don't spend all of your money, you don't get the same amount or more next year, so you're
1367.74s - 1371.74s |  incentivized to just blow money towards the end of the year, so you can say, oh, we spent
1371.74s - 1374.70s |  it all, we need more money next year, and that's ridiculous, and that's not just a thing
1374.70s - 1378.54s |  for the government, that happens in corporate too, but those are policies that absolutely
1378.54s - 1379.98s |  do not lead to the right incentives.
1380.78s - 1384.86s |  The next one is delete, delete, delete, so the idea of as you are creating more things,
1384.86s - 1389.50s |  you also need to be uncreating other things, if you set up a task force to make sure that
1389.50s - 1393.10s |  all of the asbestos was out of the building, you don't need to keep the task force when
1393.10s - 1394.78s |  the asbestos is out of the building.
1394.78s - 1397.58s |  Yeah, and then prioritize quality over quantity.
1399.18s - 1403.66s |  One staff engineer can't be replaced with ten junior engineers, it doesn't work that
1403.66s - 1407.74s |  way, right, you need to bring in technical talent and expertise from a leadership level
1407.74s - 1411.58s |  and keep those folks around, and you need to prioritize having that quality.
1413.58s - 1418.30s |  All right, so the next one, private partnerships are challenging.
1418.30s - 1420.62s |  Public private partnerships are challenging, there we go.
1421.74s - 1426.46s |  So we were at this conference, and this colonel I was talking to, he said he led some research
1426.46s - 1430.14s |  and training facility for the Air Force and how they taught people how to come in and
1430.14s - 1434.54s |  learn how to code and use Kubernetes and some other modern stuff, and my face lit up, I'm
1434.54s - 1438.30s |  like, cool, I'd love to come talk to your students and teach them about some of the
1438.30s - 1441.26s |  cool stuff we're working in Kubernetes, and the guy stonewalled me and didn't want to
1441.26s - 1444.70s |  talk to me because he thought I was trying to sell him services and stuff.
1444.70s - 1448.86s |  And I was just genuinely excited as a lead for an open source project to come talk about
1448.86s - 1452.62s |  the cool things that we were building, and so once Rebecca actually explained that to
1452.62s - 1455.74s |  him, his whole demeanor changed and he was much more open to a conversation.
1457.58s - 1460.86s |  This one's funny, so if you've ever worked in the government, you show up to a conference
1460.86s - 1465.26s |  and you ask for your landing fee because you're going to need to have snacks and somebody
1465.26s - 1466.14s |  went and bought those.
1466.78s - 1470.78s |  So we get to the Bravo hackathon and we're asked for a landing fee and Eddie says, what
1470.78s - 1472.78s |  the fuck is a landing fee?
1472.78s - 1475.66s |  I'm like, well, it's for the snacks, and to me, again, this is one of those things that's
1475.66s - 1479.10s |  so obvious, he says, well, why didn't someone just go buy the snacks?
1479.10s - 1482.94s |  Well, somebody did, we've got to pay them back, and so then he says, well, can't Defense
1482.94s - 1484.94s |  Unicorns, our company, just sponsor them?
1484.94s - 1488.30s |  I can just go swipe my company card and buy some snacks and then we don't have to do this
1488.30s - 1494.06s |  landing fee garbage, and I was like, so we could, but the paperwork that would be required
1494.06s - 1499.58s |  by the government to accept our donation of snacks would not be worth it.
1499.58s - 1503.18s |  This is simpler, I promise, just pay 20 bucks, have some Cheetos.
1505.02s - 1506.14s |  So what makes it hard?
1506.14s - 1510.86s |  Ethics requirements, that whole thing of like, look, if you look at how Russia and China
1510.86s - 1516.78s |  do business when it comes to contracting, there is a favored set of contractors who
1516.78s - 1523.74s |  get all of the work from food service to, I don't know, running newspapers, and that
1523.74s - 1526.86s |  is not how this country should be, and we don't want it to be.
1526.86s - 1531.74s |  So instead, we put together these really complicated, complex ethics requirements that make it almost
1531.74s - 1534.06s |  impossible to even have lunch with your friend who's a contractor.
1534.70s - 1538.06s |  I'm not saying that's necessarily the right answer either, and there's probably somewhere
1538.06s - 1539.42s |  in between we need to be.
1539.42s - 1543.50s |  They also tend to make people really, really gun-shy about things that they're not sure
1543.50s - 1547.58s |  whether or not are an ethical issue, and so they'll just default to like, hey, I'm not
1547.58s - 1552.14s |  going to talk to you, look at you, or ever speak to you again, Rebecca, now that you've
1552.14s - 1554.22s |  left the government because pretty much you're dead to me.
1555.26s - 1557.50s |  Next is accidentally screwing up active acquisitions.
1557.50s - 1559.18s |  They take a really freaking long time.
1559.18s - 1565.10s |  If you screw it up and have to start over, that sucks, and so if you have an active acquisition
1565.74s - 1569.58s |  in the pipeline, you're not going to speak to anyone about it because you're terrified,
1569.58s - 1571.34s |  and I almost understand that.
1571.34s - 1572.86s |  The next one, stop trying to sell me stuff.
1573.42s - 1578.22s |  When I was in the government, I had an email black box that as soon as you as a contractor
1578.22s - 1581.90s |  sent me a single email that was anything other than like directly related to current
1581.90s - 1585.18s |  existing work, you went to the black box, and I never saw your emails again or thought
1585.18s - 1586.30s |  about you ever.
1587.10s - 1593.58s |  This was not probably the best choice in retrospect, but also like Eddie absolutely would have
1593.58s - 1597.50s |  been in my black box the minute he was like, hey, I want to tell your people about some
1597.50s - 1597.82s |  stuff.
1597.82s - 1598.94s |  Can I come eat a lunch and learn?
1598.94s - 1600.70s |  I'd be like, hell no, and also black box.
1601.50s - 1604.86s |  The last one is just this unwillingness to articulate what it is that you need, this
1604.94s - 1608.46s |  I'll know it when I see it mentality that I've seen in a lot of government employees,
1608.46s - 1612.54s |  which like I'm not going to even collaborate with you on developing a requirement.
1612.54s - 1616.30s |  I'm just going to wait until something comes along and like a beacon of light, it inspires
1616.30s - 1620.46s |  me, and that's what I'm going to buy, and when I'm trying to decide how to spend internal
1620.46s - 1625.02s |  research and development funds, that is not going to be an effective mechanism for prioritizing
1625.02s - 1625.18s |  them.
1625.98s - 1626.22s |  Yeah.
1627.34s - 1629.90s |  As an open source lead, we have different foundations.
1629.90s - 1633.90s |  We have so many working groups with empty seats at the table, and government folks,
1633.90s - 1635.66s |  we want you to come join us.
1635.66s - 1636.78s |  We don't know how to reach out to you.
1636.78s - 1640.14s |  We don't know how to invite you to these working groups, but there's too many empty seats that
1640.14s - 1641.98s |  we need filled from people in the public sector.
1642.54s - 1644.94s |  We can't solve your problems if we don't know about them.
1644.94s - 1649.18s |  Someone told me the other day, I work on kubectl, a command line tool for Kubernetes, and they
1649.18s - 1653.74s |  said if you made this one small change, it would make my day-to-day life 100 times better,
1653.74s - 1657.98s |  and I was like, cool, let's go fix that right now, and their mind was blown that that was
1657.98s - 1660.62s |  just something like you can file these feature requests.
1660.62s - 1664.30s |  This is something you're allowed to do, but we don't know what your priorities are, and
1664.30s - 1666.30s |  we can't prioritize this work unless you tell us.
1667.34s - 1670.86s |  There's this stigma in the open source community, too, that a lot of folks that are building
1670.86s - 1674.06s |  open source software don't want their software used by the military.
1675.02s - 1676.14s |  It's kind of a double-edged sword.
1676.14s - 1680.70s |  That's the beauty of open source is open source allows anyone to take, modify, and use that
1680.70s - 1686.78s |  software, so it's kind of a balance we need to work through, but it's, you know, the idea
1686.78s - 1691.10s |  that the software is open source, we don't want certain groups to use it, it doesn't
1691.10s - 1695.82s |  meet the spirit of open source, and I legit just want to help, just like with that kernel.
1695.82s - 1699.42s |  A lot of open source maintainers, we're building cool things that we care about and are super
1699.42s - 1700.30s |  passionate about.
1700.30s - 1701.50s |  We really want to help.
1701.50s - 1703.26s |  We don't care about selling you things.
1703.26s - 1707.02s |  Hopefully a lot of us that work on large projects are funded by an employer to do this work
1707.02s - 1709.42s |  in open source, so engage with us.
1709.42s - 1710.54s |  Make feature requests.
1710.54s - 1711.66s |  That is what we want you to do.
1713.02s - 1714.06s |  How do we fix it?
1714.06s - 1715.02s |  I don't know.
1715.02s - 1715.82s |  I'm done.
1715.82s - 1716.22s |  Just kidding.
1717.10s - 1721.34s |  One of the things actually I love are these no-cost agreements called Cooperative Research
1721.34s - 1722.46s |  and Development Agreements.
1722.46s - 1728.06s |  They let the government share information and vice versa with academia, industry, and
1728.06s - 1731.18s |  it's a really great opportunity to, one, make it clear you're not trying to sell something,
1731.18s - 1735.18s |  you're legit trying to collaborate, but also kind of break down some of the barriers that
1735.18s - 1738.86s |  would make you maybe more resistant to sharing information within the government.
1738.86s - 1742.46s |  Yeah, and one of the things I've learned about this is that there's kind of two steps to
1742.46s - 1745.58s |  building an implementation for a government solution.
1745.58s - 1750.94s |  There's the design phase, the proposal piece, and then there's the implementation piece,
1750.94s - 1755.34s |  and if you do the first one, you're ineligible to bid and do the second one, so obviously
1755.34s - 1759.58s |  there's more money and ongoing support fees in the second one, so most groups want to
1759.58s - 1763.66s |  do that type of work and not the first group, so what you wind up with is people who are
1763.66s - 1769.82s |  technically competent implementing and building things that might not be designed the best
1769.82s - 1771.58s |  possible way, and that's not good either.
1772.54s - 1775.42s |  I think it's just finding ways to engage and learn from industry and the tech community,
1775.42s - 1778.86s |  so if you are in this room, you are doing that because you showed up, if you're a government
1778.86s - 1781.74s |  person in this room anyway, you showed up to DEF CON, so good start.
1781.74s - 1785.74s |  If you're not a government person and you're playing spot the Fed, you have for sure come
1785.74s - 1787.42s |  to the right room, and I'm really proud of you.
1789.18s - 1789.74s |  Go ahead.
1792.79s - 1794.07s |  Oh, that's a fair point.
1794.07s - 1797.03s |  Everyone's a Fed, but go ahead, look to your left, look to your right.
1797.03s - 1797.67s |  They're both Feds.
1797.67s - 1800.71s |  Talk to them, and then the last one is talk to Eddie.
1801.11s - 1805.27s |  Don't have just an email black box where you put all contractors and never speak to them.
1805.91s - 1807.43s |  Not just Eddie, but people like him.
1808.39s - 1810.15s |  Go and talk and engage with those communities.
1810.15s - 1812.07s |  I think there's a lot to be gained from that.
1812.07s - 1814.15s |  Yeah, and we mentioned open source foundations.
1814.15s - 1819.03s |  There's CNCF, Cloud Native Compute Foundation, Open Source Security Foundation.
1819.03s - 1822.39s |  There's all sorts of working groups in there, like I mentioned before, so come find us,
1822.39s - 1824.23s |  come join with us on a neutral ground.
1825.19s - 1827.11s |  So that means everything is fucked.
1827.83s - 1828.47s |  Or maybe not.
1830.34s - 1832.66s |  Here's our last kind of what you can do to help.
1833.22s - 1836.26s |  Have you ever considered a career in public service?
1836.90s - 1838.66s |  And this isn't just a meme.
1838.66s - 1842.26s |  There's ways that you can work in this space without working directly for the government.
1843.22s - 1846.26s |  Like myself, I joined a defense contractor to work in open source software,
1846.98s - 1853.38s |  but there's other methods out there, like 18F from GSA is doing a great job to cut the hiring
1853.38s - 1856.66s |  speed and kind of like up salary caps for folks.
1856.74s - 1861.22s |  CISA is also doing a great job in this space to bring people in from external talent.
1861.22s - 1864.02s |  So it's something that you should absolutely consider for your next job.
1865.38s - 1868.82s |  The next one is actually like reading law and policy.
1868.82s - 1872.50s |  I used to joke that the only thing I had going for me as an attorney was literacy,
1873.06s - 1875.46s |  because there were tons of times where people are like, oh, you can't do this.
1875.46s - 1879.54s |  And I would literally just open the policy that they were citing and read it,
1879.54s - 1882.50s |  sometimes to them, and they would go, oh, I guess you could do that.
1882.50s - 1886.74s |  It's like they could have done that step first without coming to me.
1886.74s - 1888.18s |  Like that did not take a lawyer.
1888.18s - 1891.94s |  So read it yourself, especially if you're going to bitch about it.
1891.94s - 1894.90s |  You have a lot more credibility if you've actually read it.
1894.90s - 1897.78s |  And then when you read it, if you identify things that like, look, no kidding,
1897.78s - 1902.50s |  impede your ability to get something done, there are ways to change that
1903.30s - 1906.18s |  from within the government and from outside of the government,
1906.18s - 1907.70s |  specifically from within the government.
1907.70s - 1910.90s |  I was able to change the law five different times before I left the federal government.
1911.46s - 1914.50s |  Sometimes surprisingly quickly, other times after literally,
1914.50s - 1918.66s |  literally a decade of bitching about the same thing consistently,
1918.66s - 1920.42s |  like, but it can actually happen.
1920.42s - 1921.78s |  There are ways to do it.
1921.78s - 1922.74s |  It might not be worth it.
1922.74s - 1923.30s |  It might suck.
1923.30s - 1925.54s |  But there's also other foundations that can help you do that too.
1925.54s - 1925.70s |  Yeah.
1925.70s - 1928.74s |  And if you don't want to take that initiative on your own, work with the EFF,
1928.74s - 1932.10s |  work with the ACLU, there's groups out there that this is what they are designed to do,
1932.10s - 1934.74s |  is do the right thing and fight for the right policy change.
1934.74s - 1939.86s |  And a lot of this space is if we don't get well-designed technical policy in place,
1939.86s - 1944.74s |  some random government contractor or some senator can propose something they have no idea about.
1944.74s - 1948.66s |  So we need to get ahead of regulating and legislating a lot of this technology.
1949.78s - 1952.26s |  And then the last one is, it kind of goes hand in hand with the others.
1952.26s - 1954.66s |  Like, if something seems completely stupid,
1955.46s - 1960.42s |  give it like a hot second before you just assume that everyone involved is completely dumb.
1960.42s - 1963.78s |  And like, actually see if you can dig in and see what's driving it.
1963.78s - 1967.62s |  Because if you can identify the reason for a very stupid policy,
1967.62s - 1975.30s |  then maybe you can more articulately offer something new that meets that underlying intent.
1975.30s - 1975.54s |  Yeah.
1975.54s - 1978.50s |  And you have to assume positive intent on a lot of this stuff, right?
1978.50s - 1982.74s |  Like, no one is out there to kind of do bad things that make people's lives terrible in this space.
1984.02s - 1984.66s |  I'm naive.
1985.70s - 1987.54s |  But you have to think about that, right?
1987.54s - 1991.46s |  Like, it might just be a bad implementation of a good idea originally.
1991.46s - 1995.06s |  And last but not least, invite government folks to participate in the things that you're doing.
1995.06s - 1996.10s |  Invite them to the table.
1996.10s - 1997.22s |  They do exist.
1997.38s - 2001.22s |  When I went to the Army base, I expected to see everyone walking around in fatigues
2001.22s - 2003.06s |  and holding guns and rifles.
2003.06s - 2006.50s |  And I think I saw one gun the entire time I was at the base at the front gate.
2007.06s - 2010.18s |  And everyone else was just kind of chilling as normal people in a town.
2010.18s - 2012.98s |  So I had a lot of misconceptions that I worked through.
2012.98s - 2015.54s |  And these folks are awesome and super smart.
2015.54s - 2018.34s |  So with that, I think we're definitely out of time.
2018.34s - 2020.58s |  We'll probably be out in the hallway to answer questions until...
2020.58s - 2021.86s |  Oh, I'm getting a four-minute warning.
2022.50s - 2023.30s |  Three-minute warning.
2023.30s - 2025.06s |  We could probably take one question.
2026.02s - 2026.52s |  Yes.
2045.64s - 2046.04s |  Yeah.
2046.04s - 2048.04s |  There's a lot of that going on.
2048.04s - 2053.80s |  We have an open SSF policy day in DC on September 9th or whatever that Monday is.
2053.80s - 2055.88s |  We're hoping to do a lot of good out of that.
2055.88s - 2060.76s |  Ava, if you're in the room, Ava works for CISA doing some cool policy in that front.
2061.64s - 2062.36s |  I don't see Ava.
2062.36s - 2065.40s |  But yeah, there's a lot of efforts to try and make that better.
2066.12s - 2067.96s |  And especially, like we said, the foundation work.
2067.96s - 2071.00s |  Because if we can set up those agreements with the foundation and the DoD,
2071.08s - 2074.44s |  then it no longer becomes a place of trying to sell people stuff.
2074.44s - 2078.84s |  It becomes a place of how can we collaborate and actually make technical decisions that make sense.
2079.96s - 2081.32s |  And with that, we really are out of time.
2081.32s - 2082.44s |  Thank you guys so much.
2082.44s - 2083.96s |  We will stand in the hallway.
2083.96s - 2086.76s |  Thank you.
