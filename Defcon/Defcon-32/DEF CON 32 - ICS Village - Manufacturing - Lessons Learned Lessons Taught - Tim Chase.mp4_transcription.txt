0.00s - 5.24s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 My name is Tim Chase and for the better part of a decade I have supported a number of different
5.24s - 10.32s |  critical and vital infrastructures primarily by working in what are called information
10.32s - 15.54s |  sharing and analysis centers for a number of different kind of sector specific ISACs
15.54s - 18.40s |  and ISAUs.
18.40s - 24.00s |  So this talk is not about what ISACs are and it's not about specifically what the manufacturing
24.00s - 28.80s |  ISAC is, but if you're interested in what ISACs are, what they do, how they kind of
28.80s - 32.96s |  work in the overall sort of information security space, I'd love to talk with you about that
32.96s - 38.44s |  or manufacturing ISAC if you have any questions about that or any other topic after the presentation
38.44s - 44.12s |  and depending on how quickly I go, there might even be time for Q&A if you guys have any
44.12s - 45.12s |  questions.
45.12s - 50.92s |  So a couple of things about manufacturing before we get going.
50.92s - 54.20s |  Manufacturing is defined like by the United States government and so other entities is
54.20s - 60.44s |  like an industry vertical and I've worked now sort of for manufacturing ISAC and leading
60.44s - 66.52s |  that for two and a half-ish years and it's the first industry vertical that's not really
66.52s - 67.52s |  a vertical.
67.52s - 68.52s |  It's not a vertical.
68.52s - 72.74s |  It's actually like a horizontal modality that supports every single industry.
72.74s - 80.16s |  It's not discrete like oil and gases or finances or you know electrical or something and so
80.16s - 85.68s |  it's kind of hard to generalize and because of the size and type of manufacturing, it's
85.68s - 90.12s |  also hard to like kind of generalize manufacturing.
90.12s - 94.52s |  With that said, we're going to make some generalizations about manufacturing.
94.52s - 98.16s |  So we're going to start off with the good news about manufacturing.
98.16s - 103.52s |  The good news is that manufacturers are really, really good at manufacturing and I know that
103.52s - 104.52s |  goes without saying.
104.52s - 107.44s |  You're like, well, yeah, it's their business, but I think that all of us could think of
107.44s - 113.28s |  like other industries that they're not good at their jobs, but manufacturers are really
113.28s - 114.64s |  great at manufacturing.
114.64s - 120.66s |  In fact, in human history, large portions of human history are essentially defined by
120.66s - 124.68s |  technologies that manufacturers created to be better manufacturers.
124.68s - 130.04s |  So whether that's use of water as a power source or steam or now electricity or you
130.04s - 135.88s |  know now digitization of the manufacturing space, all of those were entirely or largely
135.88s - 141.20s |  a result of sort of manufacturers wanting to manufacture more, better, faster and able
141.20s - 144.64s |  to do that, they needed to find and harness new technologies.
144.64s - 150.74s |  So they're really good at not only embracing new technology, but actually creating technology
150.74s - 155.62s |  that didn't exist to facilitate manufacturing.
155.62s - 160.96s |  Now we've moved past the point that, you know, we're using electricity to kind of help automate
160.96s - 166.24s |  and we're using, you know, digital systems to help automate and increase productivity.
166.24s - 171.56s |  But now manufacturing is moving headlong into that kind of cloud-based infrastructure, which
171.56s - 177.96s |  is heavily, you know, narrow AI and machine learning enabled to do a number of different
177.96s - 178.96s |  things.
178.96s - 187.12s |  I would say that I think about AI in manufacturing kind of the way that I do the internet circa
187.12s - 189.12s |  1993 to 1995.
189.12s - 190.16s |  We know a few different things.
190.16s - 196.96s |  We know it's going to be a big deal and we already have a number of use cases that we're
196.96s - 199.64s |  using it for and it's phenomenal.
199.64s - 203.92s |  And then the third thing is we have enough, if we're being honest, humility to realize
203.92s - 209.28s |  we don't exactly know where it's going to go and how it's actually going to affect what
209.28s - 210.28s |  we do.
210.28s - 215.72s |  But so there's sort of some similarities there in terms of new transformative technologies.
215.72s - 220.96s |  So the last thing about manufacturing, and this is actually a positive, I think overall,
220.96s - 226.08s |  is that manufacturers are their production and profit motivated, right?
226.08s - 232.32s |  It's actually what helps them to focus on and get better at the manufacturing process.
232.32s - 237.68s |  And what I mean by that is that manufacturers, you know, are businesses and manufacturers
237.68s - 243.96s |  think how do I make as many widgets as possible, as fast as possible for the lowest unit cost
243.96s - 245.84s |  per widget as possible.
245.84s - 253.28s |  And so they make decisions based upon that framework and it makes them better manufacturers.
253.28s - 258.72s |  Now with that being said, there are some downsides to that.
258.72s - 263.84s |  So the last point about how that framework that they use to determine where they're going
263.84s - 269.80s |  to spend resources and what they're going to prioritize, manufacturers are really, really
269.80s - 271.72s |  bad at cybersecurity.
271.72s - 277.24s |  And the reason is, as it turns out, cybersecurity doesn't make widgets.
277.24s - 281.24s |  And so when they're thinking and prioritizing in that framework, I want to make as many
281.24s - 287.84s |  widgets as possible, as fast as possible, as low unit costs as possible, the security
287.84s - 293.70s |  aspect usually loses out in that discussion.
293.70s - 300.08s |  That being said, as we know here, I mean, you're all here at DEF CON, there are consequences
300.08s - 304.48s |  from chronically under-resourcing security in that process.
304.48s - 309.20s |  And I think that a lot of those consequences are sort of coming home to roost for manufacturers,
309.20s - 314.96s |  especially as that attack surface is growing exponentially for them.
314.96s - 319.48s |  And there's just a lot more badness out there that can touch them.
319.48s - 321.94s |  Some of it's not even specifically directed at them.
321.94s - 325.30s |  Some of it is specifically directed at them.
325.30s - 329.18s |  One of those I would say is ransomware.
329.18s - 335.46s |  And there's a few reasons that ransomware operators really, really love manufacturers.
335.46s - 341.34s |  And the victimology is pretty narrow on what they're going after.
341.34s - 350.66s |  Number one, manufacturers' networks are typically flat and not really well segmented.
350.66s - 357.06s |  Number two, they oftentimes utilize sort of enterprise ERP systems that everyone in
357.06s - 361.68s |  that organization, whether they're working in sales in the front office or they're working
361.68s - 367.54s |  on the plant floor, have access to, to see where manufacturing processes are in line
367.54s - 372.50s |  and pull down necessary files for manufacturing process or whatever.
372.50s - 378.46s |  That is a giant vulnerability because it requires obviously IT and internet access sort of inside
378.46s - 380.02s |  of the plant floor.
380.38s - 388.34s |  But it's also why a lot of times if there's only IT intrusions in a ransomware, for instance,
388.34s - 390.66s |  it could be other things as well.
390.66s - 396.42s |  But if you're like me and you read a lot of SEC 8K disclosures, they all kind of sound
396.42s - 404.18s |  the same, but they only ever reference IT compromise, unauthorized access into IT spaces.
404.18s - 408.90s |  But if you read between the lines and you see that there's been operational or manufacturing
408.90s - 410.94s |  compromise, you're like, well, how is that possible?
410.94s - 412.66s |  They only got into the IT.
412.66s - 413.98s |  Why is your plant down?
413.98s - 418.38s |  Why are you not producing furniture or Clorox bleach products or whatever?
418.38s - 424.02s |  And the answer is that the reliance on that ERP system, they can't generate orders.
424.02s - 427.98s |  They can't pull down the necessary files to load into manufacturing processes.
427.98s - 434.82s |  So compromising just an IT system has direct OT effects.
434.82s - 441.94s |  And because it's stopping production, even if it's only in the IT environment, manufacturers,
441.94s - 444.06s |  number one, pay quickly.
444.06s - 450.14s |  Number two, they're targeting sort of mid-level enterprises, manufacturers where they're large
450.14s - 454.62s |  enough to be able to pay a decent size ransom, but they're not large enough to have really
454.62s - 458.50s |  sophisticated sort of enterprise security solutions and the like.
458.50s - 464.30s |  So it's this kind of sweet spot that ransomware operators take advantage of routinely.
464.30s - 470.92s |  And so for the last two years especially, we track our organization and the parent company
470.92s - 473.50s |  that we're a part of, the Global Resilience Federation.
473.50s - 474.50s |  You can go.
474.50s - 478.86s |  I think the most recent semi-annual ransomware report will be out in about a week.
478.86s - 481.82s |  It's free on our website, grf.org.
481.82s - 485.90s |  But our analysts, it's pretty time-consuming because our analysts have to actually go out
485.90s - 490.50s |  and scrape all the Torque leak sites about the data on the ransomware and the victims.
490.50s - 491.70s |  But we collect a lot of data.
491.70s - 494.58s |  We've got four years of data.
494.58s - 498.50s |  And just a few pieces of data that we collect are, number one, who the ransomware operator
498.50s - 500.90s |  was that had the victim.
500.90s - 502.46s |  Number two, who the victim was.
502.46s - 507.48s |  Number three, geographically, at least headquarter-wise, where the victim is located.
507.48s - 511.48s |  And number four, what industry that victim is.
511.48s - 515.74s |  And so we're able to kind of parse the data and see trends and the like.
515.74s - 519.46s |  And that's how we know ransomware is by far the most targeted industry.
519.46s - 523.78s |  I think a lot of different organizations, security researchers and the like, have said
523.78s - 528.58s |  that roughly speaking, about between two-thirds and three-quarters of all ransomware incidents
528.58s - 530.58s |  are focused at manufacturers.
530.58s - 533.80s |  So they really have a giant target on their back.
533.80s - 539.02s |  This is, I think, one of the things that, as we'll go and see, is actually helpful because
539.02s - 544.14s |  they had to learn some of the lessons of the bad decisions they were making to start making
544.14s - 546.38s |  good decisions.
546.38s - 549.06s |  So where do we go from here?
549.66s - 553.66s |  It's a pretty bad place, the security landscape.
553.66s - 559.10s |  I want to make a caveat here and say that, like I said, we couldn't generalize manufacturers.
559.10s - 563.30s |  There are manufacturers that are literally the most sophisticated from an operational
563.30s - 569.34s |  cyber perspective down to people that are maybe really large companies but are doing
569.34s - 570.66s |  almost nothing.
570.66s - 572.02s |  So it runs the gambit.
572.02s - 579.34s |  But again, we're going to kind of talk about generalities that I see.
579.34s - 582.98s |  Number one is that manufacturing is a little bit different.
582.98s - 587.14s |  And I know that I'm speaking on behalf of ICS Village and manufacturing does run a lot
587.14s - 590.38s |  of industrial protocols and the like.
590.38s - 597.62s |  But manufacturing is a little bit different in general because, well, first, in this space,
597.62s - 603.02s |  whether it's here at DEF CON or S4 or something, we hear a lot about IT-OT convergence.
603.02s - 607.34s |  And it's been a sort of buzzword bingo for the last almost 20 years.
607.34s - 612.06s |  The thing is, that term really doesn't apply to manufacturing for the most part.
612.06s - 616.86s |  And the reason is, you can't converge something that was never separated.
616.86s - 622.22s |  And most manufacturing networks were really never separated in a meaningful way, either
622.22s - 624.66s |  physically or logically.
624.66s - 626.42s |  And so that term really doesn't apply.
627.22s - 631.78s |  They're just basically running a network and some of it is used to send emails and some
631.78s - 634.22s |  of it is used on the plant floor.
634.22s - 640.22s |  Again, generalizing, sometimes they're really big, but still, in general, that's commonly
640.22s - 641.38s |  the case.
641.38s - 645.94s |  Number two is the networks themselves are becoming less industrial.
645.94s - 652.26s |  The last presentation was showing that converter from a serial connection that was running
652.26s - 655.38s |  Modbus to an IP connection.
656.26s - 657.26s |  That's very common.
657.26s - 663.22s |  So legacy systems might have one of those dongles that is changing from a legacy protocol
663.22s - 667.30s |  and a serial connection to a more kind of IP-centric network.
667.30s - 669.06s |  But that's the way that things are going.
669.06s - 671.10s |  There's a lot of reasons for that.
671.10s - 675.26s |  Some of those are mainly having to do with the technology leap sort of into the cloud
675.26s - 679.94s |  and AI enablement, meaning that the speed that things need to flow, the data needs to
679.94s - 684.82s |  flow at, and how much data needs to transit that network, you're not going to do that
684.82s - 691.22s |  on simple serial networks.
691.22s - 694.34s |  And I say the networks are becoming less industrial, not the nodes.
694.34s - 697.70s |  At the end of the day, there's still going to be an industrial process going on, and
697.70s - 702.74s |  they might have, at least for that thing, some proprietary protocol for the process
702.74s - 703.74s |  itself.
703.74s - 707.58s |  But the network on the plant floor, and it could be multiple locations, multiple production
707.58s - 715.10s |  facilities, they're not like kind of older school serial networks.
715.10s - 717.62s |  That is a challenge.
717.62s - 721.54s |  It makes it easier to build out, and he was also talking about the use of Wi-Fi in industrial
721.54s - 722.54s |  applications.
722.54s - 724.90s |  That is becoming increasingly common.
724.90s - 728.30s |  Also, those aren't necessarily the best secured.
728.30s - 732.46s |  The thinking that they have is like in the same way that people used to think about industrial
732.46s - 737.22s |  networks and why they didn't do security in it at all was, well, the network sort of
737.22s - 738.70s |  ends at the fence line.
738.70s - 743.14s |  So we don't have to worry about securing that inside, but that's not true.
743.14s - 745.18s |  We all know that that's not true.
745.18s - 753.54s |  Okay, so manufacturing is sort of, everyone is focusing now on manufacturing from a sales
753.54s - 755.86s |  and vendor perspective, solutions providers.
755.86s - 760.38s |  All of a sudden, my phone rings a lot more from those people that want to discuss manufacturing
760.38s - 763.26s |  because they're really sweet on manufacturing.
763.38s - 768.62s |  One of the things we need to consider, because manufacturing is different, is that any of
768.62s - 775.78s |  those solutions, which they do need them, they need to be able to extend to less industrial
775.78s - 776.78s |  applications.
776.78s - 781.74s |  So we have really, and I'm not going to name names, but we all can think of them, so telepathy
781.74s - 782.78s |  out to everyone.
782.78s - 787.82s |  There are really great organizations that have incredible industrial network security
787.82s - 790.58s |  tooling.
790.90s - 796.94s |  There are really great tools for cloud security, but there's not really something that's kind
796.94s - 802.58s |  of going all the way from base metal to AI-enabled cloud infrastructure.
802.58s - 807.46s |  So there are seams in that security, even if you implemented all the tools that are
807.46s - 811.06s |  currently available.
811.06s - 815.90s |  Even in that industrial network, the applications and the types of manufacturing that's going
815.90s - 819.42s |  on is becoming, I say less industrial.
819.42s - 824.86s |  It's essentially moving more towards sort of an IT-like landscape where manufacturing
824.86s - 829.54s |  devices are sort of just nodes at the end of an IT network, no different than a printer.
829.54s - 837.46s |  You can send it commands, but it doesn't look like legacy ICS environments.
837.46s - 841.42s |  Number two, I already mentioned that it needs to extend up to sort of cloud environments
841.42s - 847.10s |  to seal off some of those security gaps that we have from tooling from an ICS environment
847.10s - 849.98s |  or a sort of cloud environment.
849.98s - 855.78s |  Then number three, and this is really important, is it needs to extend down to smaller manufacturers.
855.78s - 861.74s |  Most manufacturers, there are over 100,000 in the United States alone, are very small
861.74s - 863.78s |  organizations, very small organizations.
863.78s - 867.26s |  Prior to this, I didn't have enough time to do a site survey and take some pictures for
867.26s - 872.14s |  slides and stuff to make it look pretty, but I was going to go to a manufacturer that they
872.14s - 874.38s |  make cardboard boxes.
874.38s - 878.36s |  Some of them are really intricate in terms of cutting and everything that have multiple
878.36s - 883.18s |  folds and display stands and all that kind of stuff, but they don't have a lot going
883.18s - 885.80s |  on from a security perspective.
885.80s - 890.54s |  Some of that is okay because some of their systems don't really connect directly to IT
890.54s - 895.34s |  networks, but it doesn't, yeah.
895.34s - 899.50s |  Some of these tools need to be able to go down and scale down, not just up.
899.50s - 902.94s |  Then I put in here, don't forget the cyber poor, and that kind of goes back to those
902.94s - 904.66s |  small manufacturers.
904.66s - 907.06s |  Most of my members are large organizations.
907.06s - 916.98s |  They're global Fortune 500 or even 100 companies, but their supply chains are really small.
916.98s - 922.94s |  It gets really small really, really quickly that are their upstream suppliers.
922.94s - 929.86s |  At Manufacturing ISAC, we're working currently with Don Capelli, OT CERT, to create free
929.86s - 936.54s |  training and training modules for those organizations completely free of charge, working with some
936.54s - 940.42s |  of the larger vendors to bring them in to get their supply chains to try to reach some
940.42s - 943.34s |  of those organizations that need the help.
943.34s - 947.42s |  Some of them don't know they need the help, but to try to connect them to those resources.
947.42s - 955.06s |  Maybe next year I can let you know how that endeavor goes.
955.06s - 957.82s |  We've talked about where manufacturing was.
957.82s - 967.14s |  They've always been a global leader in technology, not only adoption, but creation of new technology.
967.14s - 969.46s |  They've fallen behind in that security.
969.46s - 974.86s |  I think that it's because they haven't understood that that security is actually part of their
974.86s - 976.14s |  manufacturing process.
976.14s - 979.62s |  It needs to be thought of as part of the process itself.
979.62s - 984.02s |  Every single business does many, many different things that may not be, as you think about
984.02s - 990.58s |  it, discreetly aligned with that business and what you do, but you still have to do
990.58s - 991.62s |  it anyway.
991.62s - 993.66s |  You have HR folks and you do payroll.
993.66s - 997.38s |  Well, that's not making potato chips if you make potato chips, but it's still an important
997.38s - 1000.42s |  process nonetheless.
1000.42s - 1006.06s |  Here's why I think that manufacturers will go from cyber deniers to security high flyers.
1006.06s - 1010.50s |  It's because generally speaking, it's in their DNA to innovate.
1010.50s - 1015.00s |  They just haven't recognized yet that that needs to be a part of what they need to do.
1015.00s - 1020.58s |  This ultimately is that top line, that executive leadership.
1020.58s - 1024.50s |  When they get the idea that this is something, this is the innovation they need to do to
1024.50s - 1029.86s |  make things work, so if they're looking at the new hotness of whatever that cloud infrastructure
1029.86s - 1033.94s |  is going to help them do to move to the next level, if they understand that a part of that
1033.94s - 1039.78s |  is security and that that security needs to move up and down, that buy-in is going
1039.78s - 1048.10s |  to potentially allow them to leapfrog over some other industries that are currently seen
1048.10s - 1054.34s |  as more security mature in their ICS industrial programs.
1054.34s - 1058.82s |  I actually think that this is basically the core, the heart of the talk.
1058.82s - 1064.38s |  I actually think that manufacturing, while they're doing a terrible job right now, if
1064.38s - 1070.26s |  I come back in a year where currently there are not tools that do all of those things
1070.26s - 1072.70s |  that I just talked about, I think there will be.
1072.70s - 1078.30s |  I think that the manufacturers themselves will be some of the ones to, at least in partnership
1078.30s - 1084.22s |  with new vendors or on their own, will actually create those tools.
1085.10s - 1090.50s |  As they mature and utilize those tools in that process long enough, where other industries
1090.50s - 1094.94s |  that are in that ICS environment that are thinking about and want to use some of those
1094.94s - 1100.34s |  tools and want to move into a cloud environment, they're sort of fence sitters and they're
1100.34s - 1103.46s |  going to wait and watch to see what happens to the manufacturers.
1103.46s - 1105.94s |  Let them be the canaries in the coal mine.
1105.94s - 1110.38s |  When nothing bad happens, you're going to start to see that they're going to adopt that
1110.38s - 1113.58s |  type of technology in the future, I believe.
1113.58s - 1115.62s |  Check back with me on that.
1115.62s - 1117.70s |  It all starts with the executive leadership.
1117.70s - 1119.06s |  They're the ones that steer the ship.
1119.06s - 1122.14s |  They're the ones that do the resourcing.
1122.14s - 1126.42s |  They have a couple of things that are pushing them.
1126.42s - 1132.98s |  Number one is that they're looking at what's happening currently inside of the manufacturing
1132.98s - 1133.98s |  space.
1133.98s - 1139.02s |  They're looking at their competitors and their vendors and suppliers getting popped every
1139.02s - 1140.02s |  single day.
1140.42s - 1144.18s |  Oftentimes with ransomware, sometimes other, but they're being affected.
1144.18s - 1145.18s |  Great.
1145.18s - 1151.22s |  As a result, they have to understand that the crosshairs are on them too.
1151.22s - 1155.14s |  It kind of focuses their attention.
1155.14s - 1159.54s |  That being said, I think that generally speaking, the meetings that I have with a lot of those
1159.54s - 1166.86s |  executives, my opinion is that most of them are not necessarily thinking correctly about
1166.86s - 1168.58s |  the decisions they've made.
1168.58s - 1173.70s |  They don't actually understand the risks that they're accepting in the business, not
1173.70s - 1176.18s |  doing something.
1176.18s - 1177.18s |  That's changing now.
1177.18s - 1180.06s |  I think they understand.
1180.06s - 1181.06s |  I want to go over there.
1181.06s - 1183.50s |  I've been going over there after this.
1183.50s - 1187.34s |  I think they're understanding now how much risk they're accepting by not doing certain
1187.34s - 1189.26s |  things.
1189.26s - 1190.70s |  That's one of the things that's changing.
1190.70s - 1197.06s |  Number two, it doesn't hurt that there are new compliance and regulatory requirements
1197.06s - 1200.30s |  on them that also are focusing their attention.
1200.30s - 1201.30s |  It's not new.
1201.30s - 1207.46s |  It's new-ish, but SEC requirements that require them to have certain officers in their company
1207.46s - 1212.94s |  that have certain roles for information security and cybersecurity.
1212.94s - 1219.02s |  The new CERCEA Act is going to change some things too because now they're going to have
1219.02s - 1221.94s |  to report a lot of the things that they didn't before.
1221.94s - 1228.66s |  I also see that some of the more traditionally cyber-mature industries, a lot of that talent
1228.66s - 1230.82s |  is moving to manufacturing.
1230.82s - 1234.86s |  On most of the calls, 70% of the time, one of those people who's leading that security
1234.86s - 1239.74s |  program, a CISO or someone else, is coming from finance or someplace else that has a
1239.74s - 1243.18s |  more mature process.
1243.18s - 1246.46s |  The next question is, do I see any change now?
1246.46s - 1249.62s |  I'm telling you what I think will happen in the future, but is there anything happening
1249.62s - 1250.62s |  now?
1250.62s - 1254.14s |  The answer is kind of, maybe some glimmers.
1254.14s - 1256.58s |  This is messy data, so you don't need to look at the data.
1256.58s - 1260.14s |  The colors are the only thing that matter, really, but I told you about the ransomware
1260.14s - 1261.30s |  report.
1261.30s - 1266.22s |  In our semi-annual and annual ransomware report, the weekly ransomware report is more tactical,
1266.22s - 1268.34s |  just a lot more data on the victims.
1268.34s - 1273.78s |  The semi-annual and the annual are higher level and talk about trends in that landscape.
1273.78s - 1278.52s |  I had to write my portions for the communities that I lead, including manufacturing.
1278.52s - 1279.52s |  This is manufacturing.
1279.52s - 1281.44s |  This is dumping some of the data.
1281.44s - 1287.20s |  This was whether or not, for each one of those weeks, whether manufacturing was the most
1287.20s - 1288.20s |  targeted sector.
1288.20s - 1293.56s |  Every single week, we got the top sector targeted.
1293.56s - 1300.40s |  The first four or five columns are this past six months that I was writing on, but then
1300.40s - 1305.04s |  I was like, well, I should probably look at the previous six months, too, to do a compare
1305.04s - 1307.44s |  and contrast over that time period.
1307.44s - 1316.14s |  The rightmost column is the Q3, Q4 of 2023, and then the other column that's in the center
1316.14s - 1320.72s |  is the first six months, Q1, Q2 of 2024.
1320.72s - 1327.68s |  There's a lot more red in the far right-hand column, the second half of 2023, and a lot
1327.68s - 1336.68s |  less red in the first half of 2024, 40% less times they were the most targeted sector for
1336.92s - 1342.64s |  that week, and a 20% overall reduction in the amount of victims.
1342.64s - 1346.40s |  Now, I think it's too soon to tell whether this is a real change.
1346.40s - 1353.48s |  I also would note that we saw that the victims themselves were moving down in organizational
1353.48s - 1358.20s |  size, which means that some of those midsize organizations that do have means in order
1358.20s - 1364.24s |  to improve their situation are doing that, and they're becoming not victims.
1364.24s - 1366.56s |  Anyway, there's my glimmers of hope.
1366.56s - 1370.88s |  I've got one minute, and so I don't know if that's long enough for Q&A, but we can
1370.88s - 1373.08s |  try if anyone has a question.
1373.08s - 1378.66s |  I can't see anyone.
1378.66s - 1379.66s |  No questions?
1379.66s - 1395.86s |  A question.
1395.86s - 1398.94s |  How to make cybersecurity sexy for manufacturing.
1398.94s - 1402.82s |  I honestly don't think we can, because at the end of the day, they're business.
1402.82s - 1407.06s |  They're making decisions based upon business, but I think that that's a strong enough case
1407.06s - 1415.76s |  for them to do the right thing, I think, but we'll see.
1415.76s - 1419.76s |  Maybe one more, and then I'll jump down, but we can talk afterwards.
1419.76s - 1420.76s |  All right.
1420.76s - 1421.76s |  Well, thanks, everybody.
1421.76s - 1425.44s |  I want to go see what's next door.
