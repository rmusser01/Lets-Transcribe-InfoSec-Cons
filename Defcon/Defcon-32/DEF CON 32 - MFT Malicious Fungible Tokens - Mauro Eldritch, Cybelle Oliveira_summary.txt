**Introduction**
- Talk titled: "Malicious Fungible Tokens"
- Presented by Mauro Eldritch and Cybelle Oliveira
- Focus on NFTs as attack vectors for C2 commands

**Speakers' Backgrounds**
- Mauro: Uruguayan-Argentinian hacker, leader of BITSOC Quetzal team
- Cybelle: Works in Cyber Threat Intelligence, interested in malware research

**Concept of NFTs in Cybersecurity**
- **NFTs**: Information stored on blockchain, can be used for C2 servers
- **C2 Servers**: Send/receive malware information, resilient when based on blockchain
- Challenges: Regular servers can be banned or blacklisted; blockchain provides permanence

**Interplanetary File System (IPFS)**
- Decentralized storage system like a blockchain
- Files shared among nodes; takedown requires notifying all node owners
- **Filecoin**: Incentivizes hosting files

**Malicious Fungible Tokens (MFT)**
- Tool for creating malicious payloads using NFTs
- Coded in Ruby to exploit OpenSea
- Four NFTs used for demonstration: Initial Access Marker, Ramson Retriever, Treat Actor, Golden Locker

**Exploiting OpenSea**
- **Treat Actor**: Encodes information in Base64 and ROT13
- **Golden Locker**: Uses Base64 encoding for concealment
- **Exif Metadata**: Stores payloads, particularly in profile copyright field

**Decentralization Challenges**
- NFTs provide resilience against takedowns
- Threat of **decentralization weaponization**: Permanent phishing campaigns

**Demonstration and Challenges**
- Live demo of Golden Locker and its challenges
- Issues with demo execution, highlighting complexity in implementation

**Conclusion and Future Work**
- Importance of NFTs in cybersecurity
- Tool released for experimentation
- Invitation to future events and communities like La Villa Hacker
