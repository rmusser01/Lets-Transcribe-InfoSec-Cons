**DEF CON 32 Presentation Overview**

- **Event Details**:
  - Presentation by Justin Mott & Ava Petersen
  - Focus on discovering 0days in Vilo Home Routers
  - Conducted by student researchers from Brigham Young University
  - Duration: January to May 2024

**Research Process**:

- **Initial Recon**:
  - **OSINT**: Conducted on Vilo Living, a startup founded in 2021
  - **Black-box interactions**: With network services on the LAN
  - No previous vulnerabilities or consumer reviews found

- **Hardware Hacking**:
  - Identification of chips and connecting to the **UART interface**
  - Attempted flash memory dumping and observing CPU interactions

- **Cloud Enumeration**:
  - Discovery of **AWS S3 buckets** and IoT infrastructure
  - Authentication to router remotely and retrieving **MQTT certificates**

- **Firmware Enumeration**:
  - Investigating **kernel + libc version**, architecture
  - Emulation of binaries on x86 and compiling code for the router

**Vulnerability Discovery**:

- **Process**:
  - Reversing custom TCP protocol for mobile app-router interactions
  - Identifying stack overflows, lack of authentication, command injection
  - Reviewed 9 discovered vulnerabilities, with 6 being critical

- **Vendor Disclosure**:
  - Difficulties contacting the vendor in May 2024
  - Filing for **CVEs** in June and publishing details in August

**Conclusion and Future Research**:

- **Ease of Hacking IoT Devices**:
  - Highlighted the ease of hacking IoT devices and vendor negligence
  - Future research can focus on improving security measures in IoT products

**Presentation Content**:

- **Introduction**:
  - Team introductions and project overview
  - Mention of the **router graveyard** due to hardware failures

- **Goals**:
  - Acquire firmware for white-box testing
  - Obtain a shell on the device
  - Discover pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerabilities

- **Challenges and Solutions**:
  - Encountered issues with **soldering UART pins**
  - Reversed engineered custom protocols for router interactions

- **Exploitation Techniques**:
  - Discussed buffer overflow exploitation and command injection
  - Utilization of **qemu** for firmware emulation and **chroot** for file system mounting

- **Research Outcomes**:
  - Found 9 vulnerabilities, 6 critical, including 4 buffer overflows
  - Disclosed findings to the vendor with a 90-day deadline for patching

**Q&A Session**:

- **Fuzzing vs Manual Code Analysis**:
  - Manual code analysis was preferred due to the complexity of closed-source binaries

- **Hardware Hacking for Beginners**:
  - Encouragement for newcomers to follow their steps for learning

- **Future Firmware Updates**:
  - Discusses challenges in obtaining future firmware updates through AWS and MQTT communications
