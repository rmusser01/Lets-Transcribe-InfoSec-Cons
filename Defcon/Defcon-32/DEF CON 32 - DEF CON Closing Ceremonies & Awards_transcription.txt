0.00s - 75.42s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 I have had nightmares about this day not happening.
75.42s - 78.18s |  So to be here is a huge, huge relief.
78.18s - 81.26s |  And this is how I know my goons love me.
81.26s - 84.78s |  I was saying, you know, I've drank very little water the whole day.
84.78s - 85.78s |  I'm really dehydrated.
85.78s - 87.54s |  And they said, hey, no problem.
87.54s - 90.74s |  Got you covered with a Corona.
90.74s - 92.26s |  So good.
92.26s - 93.78s |  It's nice to be looked out for.
93.98s - 97.58s |  Hey, welcome to the closing ceremonies for DEF CON 32.
97.58s - 99.06s |  Show of hands.
99.06s - 101.50s |  Who has never been to a closing ceremony?
101.50s - 104.70s |  Oh, you're in for a treat.
104.70s - 110.54s |  Make sure you have a pea cup, because this thing goes long.
110.54s - 114.26s |  So let's get this going.
114.26s - 119.18s |  So the closing ceremonies, we kind of always start on a serious note.
119.18s - 122.42s |  And then we go in for the lulls.
123.06s - 127.78s |  The serious note is we really need to acknowledge the contributions
127.78s - 130.78s |  of those who came before us.
130.78s - 134.06s |  I think we are all standing on the shoulders of giants.
134.06s - 136.78s |  And we all don't live forever.
136.78s - 138.62s |  And so people in our community, I think,
138.62s - 142.66s |  are really big about giving back and contributing to others.
142.66s - 146.66s |  So what I want to do is just have a moment of silence.
146.66s - 149.14s |  I don't care who you think about or what you do.
149.18s - 152.06s |  But just reflect about those people that
152.06s - 156.62s |  helped you get to where you are now so they live on in your memory.
156.62s - 169.54s |  So we're just going to take a moment here.
169.54s - 178.10s |  All right, now we're going to think about all the cool shit we've done.
178.10s - 181.34s |  So the theme for this year was engage.
181.34s - 184.86s |  And it could mean many things to many people.
184.86s - 187.38s |  But for us at DEF CON, it really forced us
187.38s - 191.34s |  to try to move forward some thoughts that we've had for a long time.
191.34s - 193.78s |  And so this year, we launched two projects
193.78s - 198.26s |  to try to engage the community in different ways.
198.26s - 200.14s |  We don't know if it's going to work.
200.14s - 203.14s |  We don't know if it's going to fail spectacularly.
203.14s - 207.02s |  But sometimes failing is its own way of learning.
207.02s - 210.54s |  So the first thing we're trying is the DEF CON Franklin initiative.
210.54s - 213.90s |  And the idea here is to decide or learn,
213.90s - 217.86s |  is there a way to create sort of on ramps for those of us
217.86s - 221.58s |  who want to try to help protect critical infrastructure,
221.58s - 222.94s |  protect water systems?
222.94s - 226.06s |  And we're trying to create a sort of Rolodex matchmaking
226.06s - 230.74s |  system between those who want to help and those who need help.
230.74s - 232.66s |  And we'll start with water systems.
232.66s - 234.38s |  And if we get some good lessons learned,
234.38s - 238.26s |  we're going to maybe try it with education, with school systems.
238.26s - 241.18s |  And if it doesn't work, we're going to write that up.
241.18s - 244.98s |  And if it works, we're going to write that up and hope people duplicate it.
244.98s - 247.50s |  And the second initiative is the DEF CON Academy
247.50s - 251.18s |  done by the Pone College crew, Shellfish.
251.18s - 256.34s |  And the idea here is, how do we really help accelerate your learning?
256.34s - 259.10s |  So instead of getting to a certain skill level in seven years,
259.10s - 261.26s |  maybe you can get there in five or four years.
261.26s - 263.38s |  And it's going to take a lot of the lessons learned
263.38s - 265.82s |  from Pone College and other things.
265.82s - 268.06s |  And so this year, we're going to rough it out in beta.
268.06s - 269.94s |  And by next year, we're going to have the full launch.
269.94s - 272.30s |  And so if you see announcements throughout the year
272.30s - 275.02s |  as we're testing things out, please help out.
275.02s - 277.42s |  So those are two of our ways of trying to get the community
277.42s - 280.50s |  involved and trying to advance your skill level.
283.30s - 286.66s |  Finally, also for Engage, the DEF CON social Mastodon server
286.66s - 289.18s |  continues to run.
289.18s - 292.74s |  It's really fascinating to see the fragmentation in social media.
292.74s - 297.90s |  And it seems like across all platforms, there's reduced activity.
297.90s - 300.66s |  I don't know if it's people are just burned on social,
300.66s - 305.66s |  or it's too much different ways in which we can engage with each other.
305.66s - 311.34s |  But I think we're kind of into this post-COVID long haul.
311.34s - 313.90s |  And it's nice to have a little safe harbor.
313.90s - 317.22s |  We moderate DEF CON social with our code of conduct.
317.22s - 320.18s |  So if you kind of like the way that we try to enforce things here,
320.18s - 323.38s |  we try to do the same online.
323.38s - 326.42s |  So finally, the profit.
326.42s - 339.37s |  If you're in the room, we've created our Uber Contributor Award.
339.37s - 342.09s |  This is the third year we've done it.
342.09s - 343.73s |  And what we're trying to do here is we're
343.73s - 349.01s |  trying to hold out, as an example to the community, people we respect,
349.01s - 352.37s |  people with years or decades of contributing
352.37s - 357.21s |  to the community selflessly.
357.21s - 360.57s |  I first met the profit, I don't know, 30-something years ago
360.57s - 363.19s |  in the DEF CON VoiceBridge, I believe.
363.19s - 365.85s |  And so we've created these awards.
365.85s - 370.81s |  And I think we have what's written on it, right?
370.81s - 373.73s |  There's only so many characters we can have imprinted on these things, right?
373.73s - 375.29s |  I met him when he was a freaker.
375.29s - 378.21s |  He's a longtime writer for 2600 Magazine.
378.21s - 379.25s |  He's an educator.
379.25s - 380.37s |  He's a DJ.
380.37s - 382.29s |  And he really empowered.
382.29s - 385.57s |  And also, TeleFreak Challenge, QueerCon, you know,
385.57s - 388.73s |  it just goes on and on, his contributions over the decades.
388.73s - 391.37s |  So if you're here, profit, I think we somehow
391.37s - 395.61s |  tried to trick you into coming here without telling you what it was about.
395.61s - 396.09s |  Where is he?
396.09s - 398.61s |  Get the fuck up here, man.
398.61s - 399.57s |  Come on down.
399.57s - 410.26s |  Thank you so much.
410.26s - 412.18s |  You want to say something?
412.18s - 412.74s |  Say something.
416.30s - 417.14s |  Hi.
417.14s - 418.50s |  Wow.
418.50s - 422.10s |  So yeah, this is my 32nd DEF CON.
422.10s - 425.94s |  And I love this place, this community.
425.94s - 428.70s |  This is a magical community.
428.70s - 433.14s |  And anything you can dream can happen, because I've dreamed a lot of things
433.14s - 435.42s |  and then they've happened here.
435.42s - 440.18s |  I really hope that we can continue doing this incredible thing.
440.18s - 450.12s |  Thanks so much.
450.12s - 454.12s |  Also, I think profit might have been the first person
454.12s - 457.08s |  to actually get his award.
457.08s - 460.84s |  Because last time, I think Kingpin was gone.
460.84s - 463.08s |  Richard Dean was gone.
463.08s - 464.20s |  Oh, Wynn Schwartau.
464.20s - 466.24s |  Wynn was the first to pick his up, yeah.
466.24s - 467.68s |  He didn't see it coming either.
467.68s - 469.84s |  It was great.
469.84s - 473.44s |  OK, so this next one is something we've never done before,
473.44s - 477.96s |  which is for an organization instead of an individual.
477.96s - 479.72s |  You can guess who that might be.
479.72s - 498.18s |  The Electronic Frontier Foundation.
498.18s - 500.18s |  Thank you all so much.
500.18s - 501.62s |  What an amazing conference.
501.62s - 506.06s |  And we're so honored to have been a part of DEF CON for over 20 years now.
506.06s - 507.18s |  I think we've been coming.
510.74s - 512.74s |  Yes, hold it outwards.
512.74s - 514.66s |  Thank you all so much for all of your support.
514.66s - 519.46s |  This year, we've raised $130,000, helped speakers stay on stage,
519.46s - 527.05s |  and we're so honored to be a part of this community.
527.05s - 530.61s |  And we think that security research makes the world better for everyone.
543.05s - 546.17s |  OK, so now we're going to talk a little bit.
546.17s - 547.25s |  Mark, come on down.
547.25s - 549.37s |  We're going to talk a little bit about what we've
549.37s - 554.37s |  been wearing around our neck, the DEF CON badge.
554.37s - 556.25s |  Come on.
556.25s - 559.01s |  You can use this or the microphone.
559.01s - 561.98s |  Hi.
561.98s - 565.18s |  Hi, so it's amazing seeing you all wearing the badge,
565.18s - 569.86s |  and all the lights glowing, and the SAOs, and it's super cool.
569.86s - 572.22s |  OK, so I want to thank Team Cat Ball.
572.22s - 576.22s |  I did the concept design and coordination of the badge effort.
576.22s - 578.50s |  Bonnie Finley, 3D modeling, game art and dev.
578.50s - 580.70s |  Chris Maltby did plug-ins and game development.
580.70s - 587.30s |  He also created GB Studio, which is what we use to develop the game.
587.30s - 589.90s |  Nutmeg Ann on game development.
589.90s - 592.18s |  Will Tuttle, concept and narrative collab.
592.18s - 594.54s |  Ada RW, my kiddo over there, actually made one
594.54s - 595.86s |  of the characters on your badge.
595.86s - 600.14s |  It's a little dragon, if you wanted to play that one.
600.14s - 602.94s |  Huge thanks to Raspberry Pi for the hardware.
602.94s - 606.74s |  Entropic with Dimitri, GR for hardware development, firmware,
606.74s - 607.86s |  and emulator.
607.86s - 611.46s |  Joe Grand for hardware support and production testing.
611.46s - 614.54s |  Legion 303, music and sounds, which don't work on your game,
614.54s - 618.70s |  but they do work on the badge hardware itself.
618.70s - 620.90s |  And ICSN for manufacturing.
632.84s - 635.64s |  I really wanted to do something that was accessible,
635.64s - 637.80s |  because when I got into the scene,
637.80s - 640.00s |  I'm not a hardware engineer myself.
640.00s - 642.48s |  And so I wanted something that was really accessible
642.48s - 643.96s |  that anybody could play with.
643.96s - 646.16s |  So I reached out to Raspberry Pi.
646.16s - 648.40s |  So there's many layers on this badge
648.40s - 651.16s |  that you can get involved with, down to just like,
651.16s - 653.52s |  you could load up your own ROMs to play.
653.52s - 655.12s |  You could create your own game.
655.12s - 661.92s |  You could get as far as messing with the Raspberry Pi 2350 SDK.
661.92s - 664.56s |  The badge itself is pretty interactive.
664.56s - 665.80s |  There's a game on the badge.
665.80s - 668.88s |  There's a little story, if you play through it.
668.88s - 670.68s |  And it's really just a lot about,
670.68s - 675.92s |  if you work in the DEF CON scene and create your own projects,
675.92s - 679.52s |  it's kind of just take care of yourself, too, you know?
680.52s - 682.00s |  Infrared, yeah.
682.00s - 685.24s |  And then interacting with each other,
685.24s - 686.76s |  you can go up to other people.
686.76s - 689.28s |  And there's IR here.
689.28s - 693.08s |  And you can use that within the game.
693.08s - 694.52s |  It's a little buggy, but you know,
694.52s - 696.08s |  what isn't for a DEF CON project?
696.08s - 698.84s |  It's fine.
698.84s - 701.92s |  OK, we loaded up the conference map in here.
701.92s - 704.12s |  So you could actually get around the conference using
704.12s - 705.52s |  your badge.
705.52s - 708.36s |  And then if you get using the real time clock,
708.36s - 710.44s |  if you set your time at the beginning,
710.44s - 712.36s |  you'd be able to go into each one of the talks.
712.36s - 715.32s |  And it would tell you who is speaking at that point in time,
715.32s - 717.68s |  which is pretty cool.
717.68s - 720.00s |  I really wanted people to be able to express themselves
720.00s - 721.48s |  wearing the badge.
721.48s - 724.44s |  So there's full SAO support.
724.44s - 728.20s |  You can change LED color, which you've seen, I'm sure,
728.20s - 731.00s |  on everybody else around you, which is great.
731.00s - 734.40s |  And then the orientation was important for me,
734.40s - 737.04s |  so that you're playing in game mode here.
737.04s - 738.76s |  And then you can also be wearing it.
738.76s - 740.60s |  And after a certain period of time, it'll time out.
740.60s - 743.08s |  And then it shows your little character that you've chosen
743.08s - 744.92s |  and how far you've progressed in the game.
744.92s - 747.08s |  So you kind of can get a feel for where
747.08s - 750.00s |  everybody else is around you.
750.00s - 752.04s |  And then reusability is so important,
752.04s - 754.32s |  which is why it's a Raspberry Pi.
754.32s - 756.20s |  So you can do all kinds of things with this,
756.20s - 758.44s |  like whatever you can imagine.
758.44s - 759.44s |  So please reuse it.
759.44s - 760.56s |  Post your projects later.
763.40s - 765.56s |  And I just kind of touched on some of the hardware.
766.44s - 768.32s |  It's an ABS injection molded case,
768.32s - 770.92s |  which I experimented with last year with the plastics.
770.92s - 774.08s |  And we really got it right this year.
774.08s - 778.00s |  The RP2350, which is a brand new chip that was just
778.00s - 780.56s |  released this weekend to DEF CON attendees.
780.56s - 783.08s |  Y'all got the very first one.
783.08s - 786.32s |  And you can find out more about that chip on their website,
786.32s - 789.56s |  on Raspberry Pi's website.
789.56s - 790.72s |  Orientation sensor.
790.72s - 793.72s |  Real time clock, we talked about with the badge talks.
793.72s - 795.88s |  Customizable RGB LEDs.
795.88s - 797.80s |  IR communication.
797.80s - 800.80s |  There's a micro SD card in here that if you pop it out
800.80s - 802.76s |  and put in your computer, there's also
802.76s - 807.24s |  some goodies on there, like the official DEF CON soundtrack.
807.24s - 809.00s |  And then you can go get more, load up
809.00s - 811.24s |  more stuff with your SD card.
811.24s - 813.92s |  USB-C, and then it's rechargeable.
813.92s - 815.68s |  I have my own battery.
815.68s - 817.44s |  Audio does work on here.
817.44s - 820.08s |  Just because it doesn't work in the game in time,
820.08s - 822.08s |  you can still play audio from your badge, which
822.08s - 823.60s |  is pretty neat.
823.60s - 826.36s |  There is a touch screen, which we didn't utilize in the game.
826.36s - 828.72s |  But you can do stuff with if you do a Raspberry Pi project
828.72s - 831.00s |  with it afterwards.
831.00s - 834.76s |  And then UGB is the emulator for playing the games.
834.76s - 837.40s |  And it'll play any Game Boy compatible games.
837.40s - 842.16s |  So also Game Boy Color, all that stuff.
842.16s - 845.52s |  So Raspberry Pi has also put out a challenge.
845.52s - 848.88s |  And I put the URL here so y'all can check that out.
848.88s - 852.16s |  And they're offering a reward.
852.16s - 856.69s |  OK, whoops.
856.69s - 858.73s |  OK, sorry.
858.73s - 859.89s |  Let y'all come up.
859.89s - 867.28s |  Thank you.
867.28s - 870.20s |  OK, as you saw the sneak peek, our next slide
870.20s - 872.16s |  is on transparency.
872.16s - 874.64s |  And transparency is the flip side
874.64s - 878.32s |  of the code of conduct coin.
878.32s - 881.64s |  So I've mentioned this before, but I think it's important,
881.64s - 882.92s |  so I'll say it again.
882.92s - 886.20s |  That when we created a code of conduct for ourselves
886.20s - 890.32s |  and started getting practiced and handling them,
890.32s - 891.76s |  the next thing we needed to do is,
891.76s - 894.40s |  hey, we need to report on what we're getting to try
894.40s - 896.20s |  to hold ourselves accountable.
896.20s - 899.64s |  And so over the years, as we've gotten
899.64s - 902.48s |  different kinds of complaints or concerns,
902.48s - 904.28s |  we've recorded them slightly differently.
904.28s - 906.32s |  So this year, we put a bunch of energy
906.32s - 909.88s |  in to try to standardize all of our terms and terminology.
909.88s - 911.56s |  So year after year, we can actually
911.56s - 913.44s |  get a better idea of trends.
913.44s - 915.44s |  Because as we were trying to do trend analysis,
915.44s - 917.64s |  we realized we weren't very consistent
917.64s - 919.68s |  in between categories.
919.68s - 922.24s |  So this is the first year of our new standard.
922.24s - 925.76s |  And to talk about it, head of the SOC, CyberJunkie,
925.76s - 939.10s |  and head of the hotline, Ada.
939.10s - 941.50s |  So this is Ada's first time up here.
941.50s - 944.10s |  Many of you have seen stats that have come out of hotline.
944.10s - 947.02s |  Get closer to the microphone.
947.02s - 948.66s |  Many of you have already seen the stats
948.66s - 951.46s |  that have come out of hotline over the last couple of years.
951.46s - 952.98s |  Ada's the person who's responsible,
952.98s - 954.48s |  so this is the first time she's here
954.48s - 957.06s |  to actually talk about what's going on
957.06s - 960.18s |  and give some better color to it.
960.18s - 962.78s |  We've also juggled how things are presented.
962.78s - 965.30s |  So you'll see more aggregated stuff on the SOC
965.30s - 968.90s |  and helpline-specific things on the helpline.
968.90s - 975.02s |  So starting with SOC, we had to remove two people from staff.
975.02s - 981.14s |  One of those people was removed for harassment-type behavior,
981.14s - 985.26s |  and one was removed for unwanted touching
985.26s - 988.06s |  against one of our own staff.
988.06s - 989.54s |  We take that stuff very seriously.
989.54s - 991.58s |  We hold all of our staff accountable,
991.58s - 995.58s |  and we hold them to a high standard.
995.58s - 998.18s |  We kicked two attendees from con.
998.18s - 1000.74s |  When we kick an attendee from con, it's not a ban.
1000.74s - 1005.02s |  It's just a, we'd like you to go away, come back next year,
1005.02s - 1008.22s |  but we think you need to take time out.
1008.22s - 1011.82s |  Three people were banned from cons, however,
1011.82s - 1017.34s |  and all three were banned for sexual harassment-type
1017.34s - 1019.10s |  behavior.
1019.10s - 1022.50s |  We consider them to be people we do not want in our community.
1022.50s - 1024.58s |  Therefore, we don't want them coming here,
1024.58s - 1029.82s |  causing further problems, so we removed them permanently.
1029.82s - 1033.66s |  We had seven code of conduct complaints,
1033.66s - 1036.74s |  one verbal assault complaint, three complaints
1036.74s - 1039.62s |  for photo-violation policies.
1039.62s - 1043.54s |  We had 11 medical issues, and I'd
1043.54s - 1046.02s |  like to actually say that these were really
1046.02s - 1048.46s |  mild medical issues.
1048.46s - 1052.70s |  We had, I think, two ambulances roll, but nobody left in them.
1052.70s - 1054.62s |  Almost all of them were people who were parting
1054.62s - 1056.78s |  a little bit too hard, a couple of people
1056.78s - 1060.26s |  who were maybe not taking care of themselves
1060.26s - 1062.86s |  as well as they should.
1062.86s - 1068.22s |  They needed to drink more water.
1068.22s - 1069.54s |  The facility was fantastic.
1069.54s - 1073.02s |  This is the first time we've had an on-site nurse assisting us,
1073.02s - 1075.42s |  as well as all of the trained medical professionals
1075.42s - 1077.22s |  that the facility provides.
1077.22s - 1088.22s |  And so in the vast majority of these cases,
1088.22s - 1093.18s |  we had really swift response and good outcomes as a result.
1093.18s - 1095.42s |  But also, because there was a medical facility
1095.42s - 1097.82s |  and a medical nurse's office here, many of you
1097.82s - 1099.54s |  were able to take care of minor issues
1099.54s - 1101.30s |  yourselves, which meant you didn't
1101.30s - 1104.26s |  have to leave the conference for a Band-Aid or something.
1104.26s - 1106.18s |  And I think that's a really great improvement
1106.26s - 1109.74s |  in the experience as well.
1109.74s - 1111.94s |  Three lost property reports.
1111.94s - 1116.42s |  We had five complaints of replica money being circulated.
1116.42s - 1119.50s |  We have actually now found the individual was responsible.
1119.50s - 1121.30s |  It was a prank, but it's obviously not
1121.30s - 1122.70s |  going to happen again, hopefully.
1126.34s - 1128.90s |  Two reports of unwanted touching of property.
1128.90s - 1130.70s |  Please leave other people's stuff alone.
1135.12s - 1135.80s |  What he said.
1135.80s - 1137.36s |  One report of disruptive behavior.
1146.67s - 1148.67s |  Two reports of staff impersonation.
1148.67s - 1151.31s |  And I should add that one of them is now a member of staff.
1161.00s - 1163.36s |  He made a fake badge, a fake goon badge,
1163.36s - 1166.36s |  which we generally discourage.
1166.36s - 1168.68s |  But he was super ethical about what he did.
1168.68s - 1171.48s |  And he managed to socially engineer his way all the way
1171.48s - 1181.10s |  into the SOC, where I got to meet him face to face.
1181.10s - 1182.78s |  And so promptly, we hired him on the spot.
1187.70s - 1189.66s |  Four reports of unsecured doors.
1189.66s - 1197.06s |  And a growing issue, we have now up to 10 reports of theft.
1197.06s - 1201.70s |  Obviously, we're in a new venue, bigger venue,
1201.70s - 1203.94s |  lots more people around.
1203.94s - 1205.98s |  Please keep an eye on your stuff.
1205.98s - 1207.98s |  Don't leave laptops lying around.
1207.98s - 1213.10s |  Be mindful, as you would at any conference.
1213.10s - 1217.78s |  Ada, step in, and I'll say some last things at the end.
1217.78s - 1221.74s |  I'm not this tall, sorry.
1221.74s - 1223.08s |  So Hotline is a little different.
1223.08s - 1227.82s |  You guys really used the number this year more than ever
1227.82s - 1230.78s |  before, which we very much appreciate.
1230.78s - 1235.38s |  But probably I need a few more people to help out next year.
1235.38s - 1236.90s |  We get a lot of information calls,
1236.90s - 1239.58s |  especially before DEF CON.
1239.58s - 1243.18s |  People just asking, can I get badges, usually.
1243.18s - 1244.74s |  That's like the number one question.
1244.74s - 1245.50s |  Can I get a badge?
1245.50s - 1246.50s |  Where can I get a badge?
1246.50s - 1248.62s |  How can I get a badge?
1248.62s - 1251.74s |  So we get a lot of texts, a lot of calls that way.
1251.74s - 1255.34s |  We got four reports of sexual assault.
1255.34s - 1260.10s |  Now, not all of these reports will end up in bans.
1260.10s - 1262.62s |  Part of that is because maybe the victim doesn't
1262.62s - 1265.58s |  know too much about the other person, so we can't find them.
1265.58s - 1268.50s |  Or they don't want to necessarily do anything
1268.50s - 1269.00s |  about it.
1269.00s - 1273.62s |  They just need emotional support, and so we give that.
1273.62s - 1275.38s |  Three reports of restraining orders,
1275.38s - 1280.58s |  which we have somewhat enforced as much best as we can.
1280.58s - 1284.62s |  We're not the police, so we do our best.
1284.62s - 1287.98s |  11 people calling in just for paraprofessional counseling.
1287.98s - 1290.46s |  That's, I'm having a panic attack.
1290.46s - 1293.34s |  Can you help me?
1293.34s - 1296.02s |  I'm depressed about something that happened.
1296.02s - 1297.46s |  Can you talk to me?
1297.46s - 1299.34s |  Anything like that.
1299.34s - 1305.86s |  It's in line with suicide hotline training kind of stuff,
1305.86s - 1309.14s |  which is where I came from.
1309.14s - 1311.90s |  And then six counts of crisis counseling.
1311.90s - 1313.66s |  So if somebody calls in and something
1313.66s - 1318.86s |  needs to be done right now, my friend's in trouble,
1318.86s - 1320.74s |  something's been stolen, that kind of stuff.
1320.74s - 1323.54s |  Somebody's calling in in a panic.
1323.54s - 1328.02s |  One scam that called us to try a scam set of money,
1328.02s - 1331.42s |  which we're hotline, good luck, we have no money.
1334.42s - 1337.50s |  Three accessibility concerns, usually with the shuttles,
1337.50s - 1339.62s |  but sometimes there's other issues,
1339.62s - 1343.82s |  like a door doesn't work properly or something.
1343.82s - 1346.22s |  Before con, when we released the phone number
1346.22s - 1348.54s |  and before anyone else had the number,
1348.54s - 1350.30s |  only me, so I was the only person
1350.30s - 1352.14s |  who could respond to your calls.
1352.14s - 1353.82s |  I did my best.
1353.82s - 1357.58s |  You guys called a lot.
1357.58s - 1361.66s |  I can't answer all those calls myself, I'm sorry.
1361.66s - 1364.78s |  And one human, once again, stuck in back of house
1364.78s - 1370.86s |  who needed to be released into the wild.
1370.86s - 1374.58s |  So the last thing to say is it's the most important thing
1374.58s - 1377.82s |  to everyone on staff that people feel safe
1377.82s - 1379.54s |  and that you have a safe environment to enjoy
1379.54s - 1382.98s |  your conference and that you are safe where you stay.
1382.98s - 1386.30s |  And we're aware of reports of room searches
1386.30s - 1388.34s |  and some of the things that I'm sure you've read
1388.34s - 1389.38s |  on social media.
1390.42s - 1393.70s |  We want to say that please be cooperative
1393.70s - 1396.34s |  when these things happen, document them,
1396.34s - 1398.34s |  and please come forward and tell us.
1398.34s - 1401.18s |  The more we know, the more we can do.
1401.18s - 1404.50s |  And we are going to be issuing a report,
1404.50s - 1407.34s |  a statement after this conference
1407.34s - 1408.90s |  once everyone has checked out.
1410.38s - 1424.15s |  We don't want to have any hostages,
1424.15s - 1428.03s |  so make sure you get home first.
1428.03s - 1436.46s |  Okay, next up, press team, is Monica?
1436.46s - 1438.58s |  This year, we were really excited to have more
1438.58s - 1442.94s |  than 60 press badged through our registration
1442.94s - 1445.58s |  and many more wandering around as speakers
1445.58s - 1447.18s |  and also wearing human badges,
1447.18s - 1449.34s |  choosing not to disclose themselves.
1449.34s - 1454.34s |  That came from over 46 different news outlets,
1454.70s - 1458.22s |  half of which was from community-led properties
1458.22s - 1460.10s |  like podcasts, YouTube, and Twitch.
1460.10s - 1463.10s |  So if you're out there creating content for the community,
1463.10s - 1465.62s |  we'd love to welcome you on Citus Press next year.
1467.22s - 1470.14s |  So far, over 30 stories have been published
1470.14s - 1472.86s |  highlighting our research, community projects,
1472.86s - 1476.42s |  and different events, including the launch
1476.42s - 1479.98s |  of DEF CON Franklin, which we are very, very excited
1479.98s - 1483.30s |  to be linking up with some former government officials on.
1483.30s - 1486.50s |  And we invite you guys to please sign up
1486.50s - 1490.18s |  to join the hacker community there
1490.18s - 1493.82s |  and help make our critical water system safer.
1493.82s - 1501.46s |  Thanks, guys.
1501.46s - 1504.38s |  Okay, next up is policy at DEF CON.
1504.38s - 1507.46s |  This is our effort to try to connect hackers
1507.46s - 1508.80s |  with policymakers.
1508.80s - 1513.66s |  Come on up.
1513.66s - 1515.20s |  Hey, folks.
1515.20s - 1517.98s |  So I'm Katie Noble, otherwise known as Lady N,
1517.98s - 1521.62s |  and I am the deputy of policy at DEF CON.
1521.62s - 1524.66s |  So this is our third year, and we really want
1524.66s - 1527.02s |  to thank everyone who helped,
1527.02s - 1530.00s |  especially our attachés and our goons.
1530.00s - 1532.96s |  And if you're wondering what is policy at DEF CON,
1534.12s - 1535.94s |  so we've been going for three years,
1535.94s - 1539.14s |  and our whole goal is to bring policymakers
1539.14s - 1541.92s |  and hackers and security practitioners together
1541.92s - 1545.54s |  so that we can have informed conversations
1545.54s - 1550.10s |  about public policy so we can make public policy better.
1550.10s - 1551.90s |  And when I say public policy,
1551.90s - 1555.34s |  I mean things like laws, standards, regulations.
1555.34s - 1556.38s |  We were really honored this year
1556.38s - 1561.38s |  to have an awesome group of speakers show up.
1561.50s - 1564.98s |  So we had 10 talks in the policy section.
1564.98s - 1567.18s |  We had six talks on the creator stage.
1567.18s - 1570.54s |  We had over 1,500 people in our small little room,
1570.54s - 1572.68s |  got some great social media presence,
1572.68s - 1582.79s |  and we're really looking forward to doing it again next year.
1582.79s - 1585.67s |  Okay, so if you used our Discord server,
1585.67s - 1588.47s |  you indirectly were interacting with the next team,
1588.47s - 1597.59s |  the DevOps team, led by Riverside.
1597.59s - 1598.43s |  Hey, everyone.
1598.43s - 1599.91s |  My voice is almost gone.
1599.91s - 1601.51s |  Fox is gonna take care of this one.
1601.51s - 1604.55s |  Hi, everybody.
1604.55s - 1606.71s |  I am Fox, if you don't know me.
1606.71s - 1608.71s |  I am the second for DevOps.
1608.71s - 1611.87s |  Behind me on the slides, you can see our wonderful team.
1611.87s - 1615.31s |  They work all year round to keep the DEF CON Discord safe,
1615.31s - 1617.51s |  and when they're bored, they go ahead
1617.51s - 1620.99s |  and make integrations that make life at DEF CON better.
1622.59s - 1627.09s |  Let's see, next slide.
1627.09s - 1629.45s |  You can see some of the stats behind me
1629.45s - 1634.45s |  for all of our Discord, all the coding, the bots.
1636.05s - 1638.09s |  This year, we've added a couple more full bots.
1638.09s - 1643.09s |  We've added 1481 lines of code.
1649.18s - 1650.10s |  Sorry, guys.
1656.27s - 1657.83s |  I'll jump in and help a little bit.
1657.83s - 1661.35s |  So the total lines of production code right now
1661.35s - 1663.35s |  is almost 20,000 lines of code,
1663.35s - 1667.39s |  and every year, Discord changes their APIs.
1667.39s - 1669.39s |  They're constantly a moving target.
1669.39s - 1671.83s |  So this team, on a weekly basis,
1671.83s - 1673.83s |  is doing something no matter what,
1673.83s - 1678.23s |  and so it is a continual trickle of nonstop DEF CON,
1678.23s - 1680.67s |  and they're working really, really hard for all of you.
1680.67s - 1682.31s |  There's a ton of channels,
1682.31s - 1683.99s |  thousands and thousands of messages,
1683.99s - 1686.03s |  people connecting from all around the world,
1686.03s - 1687.75s |  and some of the folks that couldn't make it
1687.75s - 1689.67s |  are here in spirit and connecting
1689.67s - 1691.17s |  and doing really cool things.
1692.19s - 1694.83s |  We had a few people warned and a bunch of bans,
1694.83s - 1699.30s |  and they're doing a great job with that.
1699.30s - 1702.58s |  This year, some of our big wins with the extra integrations.
1702.58s - 1705.30s |  Last year, we had the data duplication village,
1705.30s - 1708.02s |  and it was kind of a sad state
1708.02s - 1709.50s |  where we had people writing down codes
1709.50s - 1710.58s |  and they had to bring the codes back.
1710.58s - 1712.70s |  So this year, we upgraded that to the scanning system,
1712.70s - 1715.78s |  which is much quicker, and in the meantime,
1715.78s - 1718.70s |  we also upgraded the info bot,
1719.18s - 1722.18s |  integrated that with the hacker tracker.
1722.18s - 1724.14s |  It was kind of last minute, in fact,
1724.14s - 1726.14s |  and so you see on the slide that every minute counts,
1726.14s - 1728.54s |  and we were coding all throughout CON this year.
1731.38s - 1732.74s |  And wait, don't switch yet.
1732.74s - 1737.74s |  So the team does Discord from everywhere and anywhere,
1738.06s - 1740.82s |  and some of the team members get called in
1740.82s - 1742.38s |  because the team is-
1742.38s - 1743.26s |  Closer to the mic.
1743.26s - 1747.18s |  Yeah, team is made of a hodgepodge of goons
1747.18s - 1748.34s |  from all the different departments
1748.94s - 1751.14s |  that we kind of pushed together to make this happen,
1751.14s - 1753.42s |  and so when their original home teams are like,
1753.42s - 1755.50s |  hey, we're short on staff,
1755.50s - 1758.34s |  they get put into other things and wander halls
1758.34s - 1761.62s |  and do things, so they're triple-hatting the things,
1761.62s - 1763.82s |  but there may be some weird spots
1763.82s - 1767.22s |  that we've Discorded at emergency points, so.
1769.62s - 1771.30s |  All I gotta say is it's a wonderful team.
1771.30s - 1772.70s |  They make my life easy.
1772.70s - 1774.74s |  Keep in mind, they work all year round,
1774.74s - 1777.38s |  and the final slide is just a data point slide
1777.42s - 1779.94s |  that if you download after closing,
1779.94s - 1782.74s |  you can see some of the demographics of our Discord.
1782.74s - 1783.58s |  Thank you.
1790.98s - 1794.14s |  All right, next up, if you've used the network at all,
1794.14s - 1796.46s |  you've interacted with the NOC.
1796.46s - 1797.78s |  Come on down.
1797.78s - 1798.62s |  Come on up.
1799.94s - 1801.26s |  You've got a ton of slides.
1801.26s - 1803.54s |  Sorry, I'll go through them quickly.
1803.54s - 1804.54s |  Hey, I'm Mac.
1804.54s - 1806.58s |  I'm number two in the NOC,
1806.58s - 1808.98s |  and we're gonna go through this really quickly.
1810.62s - 1812.50s |  So just kind of a reminder of what we do.
1812.86s - 1813.70s |  We provide the wireless.
1813.70s - 1816.54s |  We provide a lot of wired connections,
1816.54s - 1819.02s |  as well as support any things from the floor,
1819.02s - 1821.10s |  people running contest servers, et cetera.
1822.62s - 1824.38s |  This year is a little bit different.
1824.38s - 1826.34s |  We had stuff kind of lined up with Caesars
1826.34s - 1828.66s |  from the standpoint of being able to have some gear
1828.66s - 1830.50s |  left permanent in place
1830.50s - 1833.50s |  that wasn't so permanent as we thought it'd be,
1833.50s - 1835.42s |  so we ended up with only about four weeks
1835.42s - 1836.90s |  to put all of this in here.
1838.66s - 1841.78s |  So that being said, this was one of our fastest opening
1841.82s - 1846.82s |  for the Wi-Fi reg servers, the floor drops, et cetera.
1847.94s - 1849.14s |  So that was pretty good.
1850.46s - 1852.38s |  You see this every year.
1852.38s - 1855.06s |  We come in a week early on-site,
1855.06s - 1858.46s |  not including all the planning the weeks ahead of time,
1859.62s - 1862.66s |  and we work with the on-site facilities
1862.66s - 1864.50s |  to get everything up and running.
1864.50s - 1867.74s |  Ideally, by Wednesday, people come in,
1867.74s - 1870.22s |  a lot of last-minute scrambling,
1870.54s - 1871.94s |  and then hopefully no emergencies,
1871.94s - 1874.78s |  like having to do an emergency network brain surgery,
1875.74s - 1877.58s |  and then we have to have it all packed up
1877.58s - 1879.50s |  by 10 p.m. tonight.
1879.50s - 1882.90s |  So it's a lot, and it takes a big team to get it done.
1884.10s - 1886.26s |  Here's some of the stats from this year.
1887.54s - 1890.54s |  I'm gonna breeze through these, if that's okay, for time.
1891.46s - 1892.62s |  If you have any questions,
1892.62s - 1895.30s |  there'll be a pointer at the end.
1896.64s - 1898.30s |  But that being said, I do wanna say
1898.30s - 1899.98s |  thank you for using the network,
1901.46s - 1904.02s |  using it to its fullest potential.
1904.02s - 1909.02s |  We were pretty much capped the whole time,
1910.14s - 1914.70s |  and I'll be honest about, sorry, quick math,
1916.18s - 1920.34s |  about 60% of that was from the secured Wi-Fi,
1920.34s - 1923.46s |  and about 20% of that was from the insecure Wi-Fi.
1924.22s - 1929.22s |  We had at least 2,500 people online,
1929.58s - 1933.38s |  all at the same, sorry, devices online at the same time,
1933.38s - 1935.02s |  because people around here tend
1935.02s - 1937.02s |  to only have one device on them, right?
1938.18s - 1941.58s |  And again, the majority is still working on secure,
1941.58s - 1943.40s |  so it is a good place to go.
1944.74s - 1949.74s |  WIDI repartee, again, you really use the network
1949.78s - 1951.50s |  to its fullest potential,
1952.06s - 1955.46s |  and that really caused a lot of getting out of the gate,
1955.46s - 1958.06s |  starting, and hitting the brakes.
1959.02s - 1960.20s |  So thank you for that,
1960.20s - 1963.14s |  but also something we gotta work on, so sorry about that.
1965.26s - 1968.46s |  And I really kind of wanna put a shout-out, personally,
1968.46s - 1970.78s |  to a lot of the Cox Communication folks,
1970.78s - 1973.06s |  especially their wireless team.
1973.06s - 1974.42s |  We are relying on them.
1974.42s - 1976.18s |  You noticed on the previous slide,
1976.18s - 1980.02s |  there's 650 access points in this room.
1980.06s - 1982.74s |  That's a lot of money to be putting into equipment,
1982.74s - 1985.38s |  which is only used once or twice a year.
1985.38s - 1987.90s |  So we're really kind of starting to leverage
1987.90s - 1990.88s |  the facilities here for some of the things
1990.88s - 1995.06s |  that are much, much higher ticket item and harder to use.
1995.06s - 1996.74s |  But they were awesome to work with,
1996.74s - 1999.14s |  and pretty much worked with everything
1999.14s - 2000.78s |  that we wanted from them.
2002.60s - 2005.10s |  Bandwidth, Jeff, we need more bandwidth back here.
2006.42s - 2007.72s |  Tell him, don't tell me.
2010.94s - 2013.22s |  We have a bunch of stats with regards to what we saw
2013.22s - 2015.64s |  from attacks and random things around there.
2017.18s - 2020.74s |  Almost 1,000 different SSIDs advertised from various people.
2022.38s - 2025.74s |  And not a lot of those were actual mobile hotspots.
2025.74s - 2027.86s |  They tended to be other items,
2027.86s - 2029.62s |  if you know what I'm talking about.
2031.02s - 2034.90s |  And so, again, these stats and some more detailed ones
2034.90s - 2036.86s |  will be going up to NOC in a minute.
2037.86s - 2041.66s |  I really wanna put some call out to the team.
2041.66s - 2043.34s |  Everybody there.
2043.34s - 2055.44s |  Big round of appreciation, and I gotta do one thing.
2056.32s - 2057.96s |  As I said, I'm the number two.
2059.44s - 2062.24s |  Our leader, new management, Canadian.
2062.24s - 2065.40s |  Unfortunately couldn't be here for the closing ceremonies,
2065.40s - 2068.00s |  and I'm gonna talk about why in a sec.
2068.00s - 2070.98s |  This is from Sparky, he's our leader.
2071.74s - 2075.22s |  After what can only be described as the most chaotic year
2075.22s - 2077.64s |  I've had at DEF CON, with short prep time
2077.64s - 2081.22s |  and equipment issues, and a totally new space,
2082.62s - 2084.86s |  the DEF CON NOC team completed their work,
2084.86s - 2086.58s |  and not only did they complete it,
2086.58s - 2089.94s |  they did it faster and more efficient than we ever have.
2089.94s - 2092.46s |  These people are simply the best of the best.
2092.46s - 2095.52s |  The teamwork, the helping hands, the consistent team spirit
2095.52s - 2097.54s |  in the face of staggering pressure and odds
2097.54s - 2098.78s |  has been outstanding.
2099.62s - 2103.78s |  The operations group, special call out to Jeff and team,
2104.70s - 2107.06s |  should also be commended for what could be arguably
2107.06s - 2110.22s |  one of the best DEF CON changes ever.
2110.22s - 2111.62s |  Thank you so much.
2114.42s - 2115.26s |  You can applaud.
2121.12s - 2123.64s |  Again, to the Cox Communications team,
2123.64s - 2125.02s |  thank you guys for being there.
2125.02s - 2126.48s |  Your dedication to getting it done
2126.48s - 2128.88s |  is not only critical to our success,
2128.88s - 2131.64s |  but also building new relationships with ground crews
2131.64s - 2134.82s |  is hard, and we appreciate your team rocking so much.
2137.64s - 2139.56s |  Unfortunately, this is where the penny drops.
2139.56s - 2142.56s |  I've come down with pretty kick-ass round of COVID,
2142.56s - 2144.16s |  thought it was just CONCRUD,
2144.16s - 2146.62s |  but unfortunately it is the holy sea.
2148.48s - 2152.04s |  After 25 years of being in the NOC, I'm the lead role,
2152.04s - 2153.12s |  and this is where you see
2153.12s - 2155.86s |  the Canadian self-deprecating humor in here.
2157.12s - 2158.40s |  Sorry, editorial note.
2158.84s - 2163.50s |  I had an amazing speech ready,
2163.50s - 2165.22s |  singing the praises of my team and friends,
2165.22s - 2167.46s |  and just at the finish line took a stumble.
2167.46s - 2168.54s |  And I just want to say,
2168.54s - 2171.54s |  and I think this stands for all of the goons up here,
2171.54s - 2174.38s |  every one of us is a part of a team.
2174.38s - 2177.82s |  And when someone stumbles, we're all there to pick you up.
2177.82s - 2178.78s |  And that is one of the things
2178.78s - 2180.78s |  that just makes this community awesome.
2189.80s - 2193.56s |  So here's to next year, we open the NOC to the community,
2193.56s - 2195.88s |  where we're going to open the NOC to the community
2195.88s - 2199.10s |  we love so much, showing you more that we can.
2200.72s - 2202.80s |  And here's to a year where we could work together
2202.80s - 2205.28s |  to build a community that people are proud to be a part of,
2205.28s - 2208.00s |  because I know I am, love, Sparky.
2209.00s - 2212.08s |  So, sorry, that's the NOC team.
2215.41s - 2217.93s |  NOC.DEFCON.ORG, it's a little outdated,
2217.93s - 2219.13s |  but we're going to be updating that.
2219.13s - 2221.37s |  So additional stats, additional information
2221.37s - 2223.41s |  will be appearing there over the next couple of weeks.
2223.41s - 2234.44s |  And thank you for using the network.
2234.48s - 2236.80s |  We're having a little speed surgery up here.
2237.84s - 2239.28s |  It's like a Formula One race team.
2239.28s - 2242.84s |  One laptop's down, next laptop's in.
2242.84s - 2247.43s |  Click, click.
2247.43s - 2248.31s |  How many clicks do we have?
2248.31s - 2250.11s |  Four clicks.
2250.11s - 2252.84s |  Click.
2252.84s - 2258.96s |  I know, no pressure, no pressure.
2258.96s - 2260.04s |  Okay, one more click.
2264.39s - 2265.23s |  All right.
2266.87s - 2271.03s |  I will have a Thin Mint after I introduce the DCTV crew.
2271.03s - 2275.45s |  Come on up.
2280.63s - 2285.71s |  Hi folks, how's it going?
2285.71s - 2290.11s |  Who here watched talks from someplace not in this room?
2290.11s - 2291.11s |  Who watched them on the internet?
2291.11s - 2292.51s |  All right.
2292.51s - 2294.23s |  Well, we are DCTV.
2294.23s - 2297.27s |  We stream talks to the internet right now.
2298.35s - 2300.59s |  If you go to DCTV.DEFCON.ORG,
2300.59s - 2302.23s |  it lists all of our information.
2303.95s - 2308.95s |  New this year, we actually did talks or streams to YouTube.
2308.95s - 2312.01s |  In the past, we've just done Twitch and to the hotels.
2313.75s - 2314.71s |  I don't know if you noticed,
2314.71s - 2319.71s |  but we didn't have anything in the hotels this year.
2320.15s - 2321.47s |  We didn't have enough time, unfortunately,
2321.47s - 2324.27s |  to coordinate that, but hopefully next year,
2324.27s - 2329.85s |  we'll figure that out when we have a little bit more time.
2329.85s - 2331.97s |  One of the things that was interesting,
2331.97s - 2334.53s |  we saw lots of streams.
2336.17s - 2340.29s |  I think Twitch was 71,000 live viewers,
2340.29s - 2342.25s |  which is pretty amazing.
2342.25s - 2345.69s |  YouTube was 73,000.
2345.69s - 2347.93s |  These are crazy numbers, right?
2347.93s - 2350.33s |  But I guess that means everybody loves the content
2350.33s - 2352.25s |  and everybody's watching.
2352.25s - 2356.41s |  Fun facts, our team consumed 42 burritos this week
2359.74s - 2361.24s |  and 36 tacos.
2364.69s - 2368.01s |  I want to give a shout out to the DCTV family.
2368.01s - 2371.37s |  All these people are very important in making this happen.
2371.37s - 2374.87s |  Squeak, who's the second here, is up on stage as well.
2375.83s - 2380.83s |  Bool or And, Eagle One, Ghost Pepter, K-Sharp,
2382.39s - 2384.59s |  Robbins BS, and Sandwich.
2384.59s - 2387.71s |  Also, special shout outs to The Knock, right?
2387.71s - 2389.65s |  Without The Knock, we wouldn't have internet.
2389.65s - 2392.31s |  We wouldn't be able to stream to everybody.
2392.31s - 2396.46s |  Yes.
2396.46s - 2400.98s |  Special shout out to Peter and Alex and Michael,
2400.98s - 2405.14s |  who bring all of the cameras and all the camera gear.
2405.14s - 2407.20s |  They're the people who record the talks.
2408.06s - 2409.72s |  If you want, you can buy them afterwards, too.
2409.72s - 2411.38s |  It's pretty slick.
2411.38s - 2413.32s |  And Darrington from Defcon Social,
2413.32s - 2414.88s |  who helped us get all the YouTube stuff
2414.88s - 2417.04s |  and all that coordinated.
2417.04s - 2417.88s |  All right.
2417.88s - 2418.70s |  Thank you so much.
2418.70s - 2424.93s |  Appreciate it.
2424.93s - 2425.77s |  Well, this is great.
2425.77s - 2429.21s |  The new laptop doesn't show me the next slide.
2429.21s - 2430.37s |  Okay, let's roll the dice.
2430.37s - 2432.61s |  Who do we think the next slide's gonna be?
2432.61s - 2433.85s |  I'll get Japanese.
2433.85s - 2435.17s |  Exhibitors.
2435.17s - 2436.01s |  Okay.
2437.53s - 2441.61s |  Is anyone here to talk about?
2441.61s - 2442.61s |  Okay, here he comes.
2443.61s - 2454.38s |  I'm supposed to stay close.
2454.38s - 2459.88s |  Hello, Defcon.
2459.88s - 2465.80s |  I already forgot what I was gonna say.
2465.80s - 2470.50s |  So myself and KevOps, the official KevOps department,
2470.50s - 2473.98s |  work year-round to engage with organizations
2473.98s - 2476.80s |  that embody the spirit of Defcon,
2476.80s - 2480.52s |  who truly give back to the Defcon community.
2480.52s - 2483.84s |  This year's exhibitors provided amazing content
2484.84s - 2491.61s |  with great swag to our attendees.
2491.61s - 2494.57s |  In keeping with Defcon's transparency,
2494.57s - 2499.11s |  72% of the net proceeds that was generated this year
2499.11s - 2503.17s |  from exhibitors was converted to hotel accommodations
2503.17s - 2508.55s |  for our world-famous content creators.
2508.55s - 2514.19s |  Yeah, give it up.
2514.19s - 2517.31s |  21% went to charitable organizations
2517.31s - 2519.67s |  that directly support the EFF,
2519.67s - 2522.67s |  or I'm sorry, Defcon communities.
2523.31s - 2524.15s |  Like the EFF.
2525.45s - 2533.42s |  7% supported official Defcon parties.
2533.42s - 2535.66s |  NFO group is up.
2535.66s - 2547.21s |  Thanks, everyone.
2547.21s - 2548.97s |  It does show, right?
2548.97s - 2550.29s |  It does show, it's in the top right.
2550.29s - 2551.13s |  Can you see it?
2551.13s - 2551.97s |  It's that little teeny?
2551.97s - 2553.29s |  No, you just want a larger?
2553.29s - 2556.75s |  Okay.
2556.75s - 2557.59s |  Oh, there you go.
2557.59s - 2564.70s |  Okay, perfect.
2564.70s - 2566.50s |  Hello, everyone.
2566.50s - 2569.42s |  Who came out to visit one of the info nodes
2569.42s - 2572.95s |  and asked us a question?
2572.95s - 2574.95s |  How many of you got right answers?
2575.07s - 2576.51s |  No.
2576.51s - 2577.83s |  We don't always get it right,
2577.83s - 2580.43s |  but that's just how Khan is.
2580.43s - 2582.61s |  So I just want to take the time
2582.61s - 2584.63s |  to thank my second little Rue.
2584.63s - 2587.79s |  Without her support, I couldn't do what I do.
2587.79s - 2590.13s |  So I want to thank her first,
2590.13s - 2591.95s |  and then all of my info goons,
2591.95s - 2593.23s |  they're scattered about
2593.23s - 2595.91s |  because there's over 50 of us now.
2595.91s - 2599.79s |  And now I want to thank DT, Nikita,
2601.11s - 2603.91s |  all of our HQ folks that helped support us
2603.91s - 2605.79s |  because, you know, without you guys,
2605.79s - 2606.63s |  we wouldn't be here.
2606.63s - 2608.67s |  So I really appreciate all of you.
2608.67s - 2609.51s |  HackerTracker.
2609.51s - 2610.35s |  I'll get there.
2610.35s - 2611.17s |  Okay.
2611.17s - 2612.01s |  Give me a minute.
2614.59s - 2616.39s |  So without you guys, we wouldn't be here.
2616.39s - 2618.95s |  So I just want to say thank you to you guys.
2618.95s - 2620.67s |  Appreciate you very much.
2620.67s - 2623.63s |  And then the other team that really supports info
2623.63s - 2625.63s |  is the HackerTracker folks.
2625.63s - 2627.21s |  You know, you guys run our website,
2627.21s - 2628.55s |  you guys create the great app,
2628.55s - 2629.77s |  and I just want to thank you guys
2629.77s - 2632.43s |  for everything you do for us to help support us.
2632.43s - 2635.19s |  Get the right information out to you guys.
2635.19s - 2636.95s |  And then finally, I want to thank all of you humans
2636.95s - 2638.65s |  for coming to talk to us
2638.65s - 2642.39s |  and for taking all of last year's badges off our tables
2642.39s - 2644.77s |  because we had just had boxes and boxes.
2644.77s - 2646.55s |  So with that, thank you very much.
2646.55s - 2655.72s |  See you guys next year.
2655.72s - 2656.56s |  All right.
2656.56s - 2657.74s |  Speakers.
2659.76s - 2660.88s |  Hello, DEF CON.
2662.36s - 2663.20s |  I'm Pasties.
2663.20s - 2665.30s |  I'm number two for speaker operations.
2665.30s - 2668.44s |  We're responsible for tracks one through four
2668.44s - 2669.28s |  and war stories.
2669.64s - 2671.72s |  So if you saw any talks in there,
2671.72s - 2676.44s |  our team was the one that was getting people out and about
2676.44s - 2677.56s |  and like talking to each other,
2677.56s - 2680.56s |  engaging with some of the active content creators.
2680.56s - 2682.88s |  But we had another stage,
2682.88s - 2684.88s |  which was managed by a separate team.
2684.88s - 2687.24s |  It was the content creator stage.
2687.24s - 2688.28s |  They talked to us,
2688.28s - 2690.20s |  but they ran almost entirely on their own.
2690.20s - 2692.96s |  They just asked us a few questions ahead of time
2692.96s - 2695.72s |  and then they were off to the races and they rocked it.
2695.72s - 2697.78s |  Who saw content creator talks?
2698.78s - 2700.10s |  Yeah.
2700.10s - 2702.66s |  Who saw main stage talks?
2702.66s - 2703.50s |  Yeah.
2703.50s - 2704.94s |  All right.
2704.94s - 2705.78s |  It's always nice.
2705.78s - 2706.60s |  I was like,
2706.60s - 2708.78s |  I know that the people like to say like,
2708.78s - 2712.10s |  we'll watch the talks after the con is over,
2712.10s - 2715.10s |  but there is something about attending in person.
2715.10s - 2718.50s |  We do do some QVR metrics just to see how people
2718.50s - 2720.62s |  are engaging with our talks.
2720.62s - 2722.94s |  See if there's anything that we can improve.
2722.94s - 2726.30s |  New venues are always a particularly hard challenge.
2726.34s - 2728.26s |  You're working with new people, new spaces.
2728.26s - 2731.14s |  You don't know what's going to be involved in there.
2731.14s - 2733.48s |  Our AV people were fantastic.
2733.48s - 2734.66s |  They were incredibly fast.
2734.66s - 2738.62s |  They were doing some insane switchovers of the stages,
2738.62s - 2739.46s |  mostly in here.
2739.46s - 2742.78s |  So if you're in here for any of the fire stock changes,
2742.78s - 2746.66s |  we were alternating between like the setup that you see here
2746.66s - 2748.82s |  and having a sort of a lounge display.
2748.82s - 2749.90s |  And we did it in another track,
2749.90s - 2751.86s |  which caught us all off guard
2751.86s - 2754.50s |  because just that's how it works.
2754.50s - 2755.58s |  But they were hustling.
2755.70s - 2758.82s |  I want to set a big, big thanks out to them.
2758.82s - 2761.42s |  We do some impromptu collection of data
2761.42s - 2763.02s |  as people are leaving to sort of see
2763.02s - 2764.90s |  how they felt about the talks.
2764.90s - 2767.14s |  It's a scale of one to five and 63%,
2767.14s - 2769.50s |  I think it was 65%, sorry,
2769.50s - 2771.06s |  were called out as being great,
2771.06s - 2774.60s |  which is what we leave, this is a five out of five.
2775.98s - 2778.18s |  This is fantastic.
2778.18s - 2780.50s |  We also only had eight minutes of downtime
2780.50s - 2782.90s |  after our first morning.
2782.90s - 2784.46s |  There was a little bit more on our first morning
2784.46s - 2785.66s |  and we weren't collecting our metrics.
2785.66s - 2786.74s |  So those were not included
2786.74s - 2789.62s |  and you might've seen some spiciness around there.
2789.62s - 2794.62s |  And we had one talk, cease and desist are not unusual.
2794.62s - 2796.52s |  Unfortunately, we get, there's usually, you know,
2796.52s - 2798.86s |  one or two that kicks around.
2798.86s - 2801.02s |  This one sort of came in last minute
2801.02s - 2806.02s |  and the EFF, they graciously decided to help that creator.
2806.06s - 2808.26s |  So a round of applause for the EFF.
2815.44s - 2818.00s |  So they were able to help that speaker
2818.00s - 2819.44s |  reschedule their talk for Sunday.
2820.20s - 2821.52s |  They were able to do the talk
2821.52s - 2822.88s |  and we were able to move forward.
2822.88s - 2825.44s |  So if you do want to talk at DEF CON,
2825.44s - 2826.72s |  DEF CON does have your back,
2826.72s - 2828.68s |  as long as it's very reasonable,
2828.68s - 2830.48s |  we'll try and help and make sure
2830.48s - 2832.64s |  that your content gets presented
2832.64s - 2835.66s |  because we want to share with you guys.
2835.66s - 2837.06s |  So thank you, DEF CON.
2837.06s - 2847.28s |  We'll see you next year.
2847.28s - 2848.12s |  All right.
2848.12s - 2852.38s |  So getting you all badged up is a feat.
2852.38s - 2854.60s |  Getting everybody who's not a human badged up
2854.60s - 2856.16s |  is also a feat.
2856.16s - 2869.94s |  And that is held by the Inhuman Registration Department.
2869.94s - 2873.14s |  Hello, I'm the second for Inhuman, Esteban Restibang,
2873.14s - 2874.82s |  and this is Aster, the lead.
2875.96s - 2880.66s |  This year we badged over 1,600 Inhumans.
2880.66s - 2883.10s |  It's a lot, probably a little bit more than that.
2884.10s - 2885.68s |  Those are all the people who go
2885.68s - 2888.26s |  and make this incredible event what it is.
2888.26s - 2890.98s |  And it's super awesome to see them come through,
2890.98s - 2893.10s |  check in, grab their stuff,
2893.10s - 2896.06s |  and take off to go do wonderful things.
2897.22s - 2899.34s |  We also take care of black badges,
2899.34s - 2902.50s |  so the people who come back after winning an event.
2902.50s - 2905.46s |  And we had about 87 of those people show up this year,
2905.46s - 2907.34s |  and 15 retirees show up.
2907.34s - 2908.86s |  Retirees are weird ones,
2908.86s - 2910.18s |  because there's a lot of people who retire
2910.18s - 2911.30s |  but don't actually retire.
2911.30s - 2912.76s |  They keep working, so.
2912.76s - 2917.42s |  Speaking of which, Esteban is retiring this year
2917.42s - 2926.68s |  after 16 years as a goon and eight years doing this.
2926.68s - 2928.36s |  Thank you.
2928.36s - 2929.20s |  Yeah.
2929.20s - 2931.56s |  So if next year is just utter chaos, sorry.
2933.22s - 2935.38s |  And we badged 580 goons this year,
2935.38s - 2936.96s |  so it's a lot of goons.
2938.36s - 2940.32s |  Yeah, it's changed a lot since DEF CON 9,
2940.32s - 2942.08s |  which was my first.
2942.08s - 2944.68s |  Inhuman didn't really exist as a department,
2944.68s - 2948.14s |  and it's grown immensely in the last eight years
2948.14s - 2952.40s |  since we immortalists took it over, right?
2952.40s - 2953.24s |  Created it, really.
2953.24s - 2954.32s |  Created it, yeah.
2954.32s - 2955.88s |  Thank you to our goons.
2955.88s - 2959.04s |  Danny, Charms, McMayhem, Deca, and Louise as well.
2959.04s - 2968.50s |  So thanks, everybody.
2968.50s - 2969.90s |  All right.
2969.90s - 2970.74s |  Show of hands.
2970.74s - 2972.94s |  How many people attended a workshop?
2974.14s - 2976.74s |  How many wished they could have attended a workshop?
2977.64s - 2979.32s |  Yeah, we're trying.
2980.40s - 2982.40s |  Okay, let's bring up the workshop team.
2987.54s - 2988.38s |  Hey, everyone.
2990.84s - 2991.88s |  Thank you guys all.
2991.88s - 2992.72s |  This is so much fun.
2992.72s - 2993.54s |  I love this.
2993.54s - 2995.56s |  So workshops is, if you're not aware,
2995.84s - 2996.84s |  there are four-hour,
2996.84s - 2998.80s |  this year there were four-hour sessions.
2998.80s - 3001.60s |  We had over 29,
3001.60s - 3003.68s |  or we had 29 bespoke sessions.
3003.68s - 3006.40s |  That was, thanks to my second for that beautiful word.
3007.36s - 3010.44s |  Of those 29 sessions, we covered so many different topics.
3010.44s - 3011.56s |  There's a little bit of a blend
3011.56s - 3013.80s |  of both blue and red team stuff.
3013.80s - 3017.32s |  Lots of hacking going on, and a lot of defending, too.
3017.32s - 3019.30s |  Some of the best points that we had,
3019.30s - 3021.72s |  we had our four-hour sessions.
3021.72s - 3023.84s |  Our tickets, when they go online,
3023.84s - 3025.80s |  those go up usually like first week of July,
3025.80s - 3027.20s |  right after the 4th of July weekend
3027.20s - 3028.76s |  here in the United States.
3028.76s - 3030.56s |  Sold out within three minutes.
3030.56s - 3033.72s |  So when I say sold out, these are free sessions.
3033.72s - 3035.66s |  Our instructors come in,
3035.66s - 3037.84s |  they do this out of the goodness of their hearts.
3037.84s - 3040.48s |  We put these on and just have a blast doing it,
3040.48s - 3041.84s |  supporting them in any way we can,
3041.84s - 3044.12s |  supporting the community as well.
3044.12s - 3047.68s |  So three minutes after tickets go on sale.
3047.68s - 3049.60s |  One of the best things that we've got
3049.60s - 3053.32s |  is the forums thread that we start up every year,
3053.32s - 3055.88s |  where you can swap tickets if you happen to get one,
3055.88s - 3057.68s |  and you end up not being able to use it.
3057.68s - 3060.32s |  So keep an eye on forums to see those swaps happening
3060.32s - 3062.60s |  if you're looking to get into one of the workshops.
3062.60s - 3064.76s |  Seating is really limited.
3064.76s - 3067.56s |  This year, we were over the Spring Hill Suites,
3067.56s - 3069.52s |  where we had a great time.
3069.52s - 3073.36s |  Smaller environment, had some challenges.
3073.36s - 3076.24s |  Air conditioning didn't necessarily work too well,
3076.24s - 3080.08s |  and may have gotten a little overwhelmed
3080.08s - 3082.76s |  and caused the leak in the ceiling to fall,
3083.48s - 3086.44s |  things like that, just typical.
3087.76s - 3090.76s |  Over there, we had some amazing help from the folks,
3090.76s - 3094.68s |  the boots on the ground at the hotel, super responsive.
3094.68s - 3096.84s |  They gave us free coffee, you guys.
3096.84s - 3098.84s |  They gave us free coffee, it was great.
3102.00s - 3104.32s |  In addition to the delightful coffee,
3104.32s - 3108.72s |  we also were the recipients in our little op center there
3108.72s - 3112.16s |  of two amazing packages of some Tim Tam cookies.
3113.00s - 3116.44s |  We did consume 864 bottles of water in the space,
3116.44s - 3118.16s |  so that's pretty good.
3118.16s - 3120.68s |  Of that coffee, we had 15 gallons,
3120.68s - 3124.32s |  so that's a lot of caffeine, man, that's a lot of caffeine.
3125.52s - 3127.88s |  As a part of our workshops, people bring in tools.
3127.88s - 3132.24s |  They bring in different, whether it's working on,
3132.24s - 3135.52s |  off of the RFID readers or the programmers,
3135.52s - 3137.80s |  they'll bring those in as part of our workshops.
3137.80s - 3140.72s |  This year, we had a blow-up house,
3140.72s - 3141.84s |  which was kind of interesting,
3141.84s - 3146.00s |  and that supported a physical security hacking challenge
3146.00s - 3148.76s |  as a part of one of the workshops there.
3148.76s - 3152.76s |  We also had a challenge at the hotel with the network.
3152.76s - 3155.28s |  We were leveraging the hotel network,
3155.28s - 3157.96s |  and it was super great of them to provide that for us,
3157.96s - 3160.64s |  but we found some DHCP leases
3160.64s - 3162.36s |  that lasted a little bit too long.
3162.36s - 3163.76s |  They weren't releasing things,
3163.76s - 3166.44s |  so they created fake rooms for us
3166.44s - 3168.08s |  so we could get people on the guest network
3168.08s - 3169.68s |  and have the enhanced capabilities
3169.68s - 3171.80s |  of what that was able to be able to handle,
3172.64s - 3174.84s |  so really want to, once again, just seriously,
3174.84s - 3176.28s |  those guys are awesome over there.
3176.28s - 3177.24s |  We need to use them.
3177.24s - 3180.68s |  In the meantime, workshops call goes out every year.
3180.68s - 3182.88s |  If you have a topic you want to teach on,
3182.88s - 3184.68s |  please submit next year.
3184.68s - 3188.88s |  Same time, just as call for papers goes out, please submit.
3188.88s - 3191.44s |  We go through a standard vetting process.
3191.44s - 3193.64s |  This year, we were able to support the villages
3193.64s - 3195.80s |  because they changed the environment here,
3195.80s - 3196.64s |  so we were able to support
3196.64s - 3198.44s |  some of the village workshops as well.
3198.44s - 3200.68s |  So if you have a topic you're really passionate about
3200.68s - 3203.68s |  and you want to go ahead and instruct a group of people,
3203.68s - 3206.24s |  please submit, and we'd love to get you on stage.
3206.24s - 3214.50s |  Thank you.
3214.50s - 3217.62s |  All right, I have this pretty picture that you provided.
3217.62s - 3218.66s |  Look at that pretty picture.
3218.66s - 3220.82s |  This is what workshops look like.
3220.82s - 3222.62s |  That's not the leaking ceiling, though.
3222.62s - 3223.78s |  That's the bouncy house.
3223.78s - 3224.78s |  And that's the bouncy house.
3224.78s - 3226.10s |  They're all in the bouncy house.
3226.10s - 3228.10s |  Yeah, they look pretty happy about that.
3231.59s - 3234.19s |  So there is a slide that we forgot to include,
3234.19s - 3236.11s |  and I'm really embarrassed about it,
3236.11s - 3237.67s |  but back on the...
3237.67s - 3240.31s |  We rewind ourselves to early in the evening.
3241.35s - 3243.15s |  Building the community and engagement,
3243.15s - 3245.83s |  we launched something new this year,
3245.83s - 3248.63s |  DEF CON Next Gen, DC Next Gen,
3248.63s - 3252.55s |  which is the evolution and the improvement of DEF CON Kids.
3252.55s - 3255.19s |  And I'm not sure if Bia is here.
3255.19s - 3256.75s |  We were messaging,
3256.75s - 3258.87s |  but I don't know if she could make it here fast enough.
3258.87s - 3260.19s |  Oh, here we go.
3260.19s - 3261.27s |  Yes.
3262.27s - 3266.47s |  Okay, so give us some good words about DEF CON Next Gen.
3266.47s - 3269.39s |  Hello, DEF CON.
3272.81s - 3275.57s |  For those of you who don't know me, I am Heave.
3275.57s - 3278.13s |  My daughter is Bia Silab.
3278.13s - 3280.73s |  She started out, woo,
3280.73s - 3285.21s |  she started out in Roots Asylum when she was 11.
3285.21s - 3287.57s |  And when Roots died,
3287.57s - 3290.93s |  she pretty much harassed Nikita and Jeff nonstop
3290.93s - 3293.69s |  to get another kid's track going.
3294.29s - 3296.33s |  So they were gracious enough last year
3296.33s - 3299.33s |  to make her the youngest goon at 16.
3299.33s - 3303.41s |  And she kind of monitored the DEF CON Kids.
3303.41s - 3308.41s |  And this year she set up DC Next Gen all by herself
3308.45s - 3312.17s |  with a little logistical help from myself and some goons.
3312.17s - 3314.01s |  And I have some notes I'm going to read.
3314.01s - 3314.85s |  Here we go.
3316.01s - 3319.29s |  And she set it up so well
3319.29s - 3322.13s |  that when she got sick on Thursday,
3322.13s - 3325.17s |  the entire DC Next Gen ran all by itself
3325.17s - 3327.17s |  without any intervention from herself.
3327.17s - 3334.91s |  So I think that says a lot for her.
3334.91s - 3339.31s |  So last year we had about 50 kids.
3339.31s - 3346.18s |  This year we had 150.
3346.18s - 3350.06s |  And heads up, Jeff and Nikita,
3350.06s - 3355.06s |  we, our goons fielded the questions about DC Next Gen
3355.30s - 3356.58s |  and the number of parents
3356.58s - 3360.42s |  who are bringing their kids next year is staggering.
3360.42s - 3363.18s |  So the badge, the kids had a badge,
3363.18s - 3364.78s |  which was built by Braden Lane.
3364.78s - 3365.86s |  It was really cool.
3365.86s - 3367.94s |  It had all kinds of stuff in it.
3367.94s - 3370.86s |  Programmable in Circuit Python.
3370.86s - 3372.10s |  We had soldering kits.
3372.10s - 3374.54s |  Blenster, who everybody knows and loves,
3374.54s - 3378.38s |  he threw down and made a DC Next Gen soldering badge
3378.38s - 3383.14s |  after he saw the amazing Raider Raccoon logo that Mar made.
3383.14s - 3385.78s |  And then Hacker Boxes also provided us
3385.78s - 3388.38s |  some more soldering kits for the kids.
3388.38s - 3389.86s |  We had a number of classes.
3389.86s - 3392.66s |  Of course, a Circuit Python class built around the badge,
3392.66s - 3396.66s |  secure coding, zero trust networking with CloudFlare,
3396.66s - 3398.50s |  along with a number of classes
3398.50s - 3401.94s |  and panel discussions and talks.
3401.94s - 3405.62s |  One thing we did this year compared to like Roots Asylum,
3405.62s - 3408.30s |  instead of trapping the kids in a room,
3408.30s - 3411.34s |  we worked with the villages around the whole conference
3411.34s - 3413.46s |  and encouraged the kids to go out
3413.46s - 3414.58s |  and explore the conference
3414.58s - 3418.02s |  and find what they really enjoyed and what drove them.
3419.22s - 3420.46s |  We had our goons.
3420.46s - 3424.46s |  I'd like to thank Braden Lane, Heidi,
3424.46s - 3426.58s |  along with our volunteers.
3426.58s - 3429.74s |  And I'd also like to thank a special shout out
3429.74s - 3432.46s |  to both the NOC and the Packet Capture Village.
3432.46s - 3435.22s |  We had some problems with our laptops
3435.22s - 3437.50s |  and those guys put together everything we needed
3437.50s - 3439.34s |  to throw together an ad hoc network.
3439.34s - 3440.58s |  It was amazing.
3440.58s - 3445.58s |  And of course, Kevin, Chef, Jeff, Neil and Nikita
3447.06s - 3449.78s |  for supporting us on the backend with DC Next Gen.
3449.78s - 3452.58s |  So bring your kids to DEF CON.
3452.58s - 3460.32s |  Thank you.
3460.32s - 3464.12s |  So for many of you, DEF CON is over shortly,
3464.12s - 3466.92s |  but there is another two days of training.
3466.92s - 3468.68s |  This is something we started a few years ago.
3468.68s - 3472.04s |  So for many of us, well, for some of us, I should say,
3472.04s - 3475.56s |  Monday and Tuesday is more training
3475.56s - 3477.52s |  over at the, where are we at?
3477.52s - 3478.88s |  Sahara?
3478.88s - 3479.72s |  Yes.
3479.72s - 3481.36s |  Yeah, Sahara.
3481.36s - 3482.28s |  And when we started it,
3482.28s - 3483.64s |  we tried to do something a little different
3483.64s - 3484.48s |  with the community.
3484.48s - 3487.76s |  We're splitting the revenue 50-50 with the trainers
3487.76s - 3490.16s |  because we think that's fair.
3490.16s - 3492.88s |  And so we have a pretty diverse set of training.
3492.88s - 3494.32s |  That's pretty cool.
3494.32s - 3498.40s |  Okay, next up, arts and entertainment.
3499.36s - 3505.92s |  Chris AM.
3505.92s - 3508.20s |  We have, oh, here we go.
3508.20s - 3513.20s |  From my left stage right, Chris AM and crew.
3514.04s - 3516.00s |  We should really have some deep drum
3516.00s - 3523.12s |  and bass playing right now.
3523.12s - 3524.32s |  Hey everybody, I'm Chris AM,
3524.32s - 3527.36s |  the arts and entertainment department head.
3527.36s - 3530.84s |  Our purview is the main parties that you see
3530.84s - 3532.36s |  in the Syn and the Axe stages,
3532.36s - 3535.04s |  as well as helping out a lot of the other groups
3535.04s - 3539.32s |  around here, the parties team, a lot of the villages,
3539.32s - 3540.72s |  a lot of the side events.
3540.72s - 3542.64s |  We try to help them out as much as possible.
3543.16s - 3544.92s |  And I've got a really great set of goons
3544.92s - 3546.56s |  that are working for me
3546.56s - 3549.56s |  that just really bust it every time, all day, every day.
3549.56s - 3554.32s |  We're up to all hours and it's really fun, super fun.
3554.32s - 3557.64s |  And I want to thank everybody that attended our parties
3557.64s - 3559.96s |  up in the Syn and the Axe stages.
3559.96s - 3566.45s |  Did anybody get to see the Pirate Band last night?
3566.45s - 3568.09s |  Did anybody dress up?
3569.29s - 3570.45s |  Yeah.
3571.93s - 3574.37s |  And what did you think of the night before that
3574.81s - 3575.65s |  with the retro sci-fi?
3575.65s - 3576.49s |  Did anybody dress up for that?
3576.49s - 3581.25s |  We had some really cool homemade costumes that people made.
3582.85s - 3584.69s |  So I wanted to thank a couple of people
3584.69s - 3587.25s |  before I get off the stage here.
3587.25s - 3589.77s |  So I want to thank my entire crew.
3589.77s - 3592.73s |  I want to thank my second, Chris Klink.
3592.73s - 3594.73s |  He couldn't join us here on stage today,
3594.73s - 3597.33s |  but the rest of us are here.
3597.33s - 3599.81s |  We'll talk about the folks behind me in a second.
3599.81s - 3602.17s |  I'd like to thank everybody in QM.
3602.17s - 3604.05s |  They were gracious hosts to us.
3604.73s - 3605.77s |  They carved out a nice little space for us
3605.77s - 3608.29s |  right behind this wall for all of our gear.
3608.29s - 3611.97s |  I want to thank Log and his parties team.
3611.97s - 3614.09s |  They were really, really helpful to us,
3614.09s - 3616.13s |  getting gear back and forth, getting stuff set up,
3616.13s - 3617.09s |  teared down on time.
3617.09s - 3619.69s |  So that was really helpful.
3619.69s - 3620.85s |  There are so many other people
3620.85s - 3622.97s |  that we need help and assistance from
3622.97s - 3626.73s |  to make things successful that just can't list.
3626.73s - 3631.57s |  Behind me on the screen are the performers that you've seen.
3631.57s - 3633.53s |  Really, really like to have them there.
3635.05s - 3637.41s |  So everything that we did was recorded.
3637.41s - 3641.89s |  You'll be able to see it in the DEF CON archive pretty soon,
3641.89s - 3643.45s |  as soon as we get it up there.
3644.41s - 3647.09s |  I know I'm forgetting some things.
3648.13s - 3649.77s |  What do we want to do next?
3649.77s - 3652.53s |  Yeah, so this is a transitional year for us.
3652.53s - 3654.69s |  We're going to play a little bit of musical chairs
3654.69s - 3656.53s |  with who's in leadership positions
3656.53s - 3658.57s |  in the arts and entertainment department.
3658.57s - 3660.53s |  I'm going to take a step back from this
3660.53s - 3662.85s |  and just be a normal A&E goon,
3662.93s - 3665.09s |  where Zekes is stepping up to take over
3665.09s - 3667.05s |  as department head going forward.
3669.75s - 3670.59s |  Sucker.
3670.59s - 3671.43s |  Yeah.
3672.83s - 3674.59s |  You want to say some words, Zekes?
3675.63s - 3676.95s |  Hi, DEF CON.
3676.95s - 3678.99s |  So yeah, I'm taking over this year.
3678.99s - 3681.27s |  Well, taking over next year.
3681.27s - 3686.27s |  We start our process for this in about two weeks.
3686.35s - 3691.35s |  So what that means is that we will be starting
3691.39s - 3695.55s |  to look at new acts, stuff like that.
3697.23s - 3700.71s |  About January, we'll start doing a call for DJs and whatnot.
3701.67s - 3704.79s |  Behind me, I want to thank two people especially.
3704.79s - 3706.67s |  I've got Chonez here.
3706.67s - 3707.59s |  Hi.
3707.59s - 3712.59s |  He's our resident audio goon and video guy extraordinaire.
3713.67s - 3717.47s |  He helped me a huge, huge, huge thanks
3717.47s - 3720.55s |  for all your help in getting the video done
3720.63s - 3724.55s |  for our Twitch stream and all of our recording.
3724.55s - 3728.99s |  Absolutely phenomenal work from him and his right-hand man.
3728.99s - 3730.71s |  On my other side here is Shorzy.
3731.55s - 3734.15s |  Shorzy's our new lighting guy.
3734.15s - 3737.47s |  He did a lot of the lighting for our chill room.
3737.47s - 3738.95s |  Had an absolute blast,
3738.95s - 3741.51s |  made that room look completely different.
3741.51s - 3743.71s |  It was white walls when we walked in.
3743.71s - 3747.79s |  It was absolute color when he got done with it.
3747.79s - 3749.11s |  So big thanks to him.
3750.11s - 3752.79s |  Let's see, we did all the recordings.
3752.79s - 3755.35s |  We did have a little bit of a problem on Friday night.
3755.35s - 3758.19s |  We lost some internet connectivity.
3758.19s - 3760.31s |  It's DEF CON, it happens.
3760.31s - 3762.39s |  Luckily though, we recorded it all.
3762.39s - 3765.51s |  It will be on media.defcon.org.
3765.51s - 3767.55s |  Give me a couple weeks.
3767.55s - 3769.23s |  I need to decompress.
3770.15s - 3772.11s |  I need to decompress just a little bit.
3772.11s - 3774.07s |  I'll get all that footage all nice and neat.
3774.07s - 3776.31s |  All the music, all nice and neat.
3776.31s - 3778.47s |  We'll get it uploaded to you guys.
3778.83s - 3780.23s |  It'll be great to listen to.
3781.63s - 3782.59s |  I think that's it.
3783.43s - 3784.27s |  Go ahead.
3784.27s - 3787.27s |  Look out for the call for music for next year's DEF CON
3787.27s - 3789.79s |  starting right around January 1st.
3789.79s - 3792.11s |  And we'll be opening the call for soundtrack
3792.11s - 3793.23s |  soon after that.
3793.23s - 3796.95s |  Yeah, that's gonna be on defconmusic.org.
3796.95s - 3800.59s |  Our site will have an announcement up there for you.
3800.59s - 3801.43s |  Thank you guys.
3801.43s - 3810.20s |  See you next year.
3810.20s - 3813.12s |  Okay, so music is an appropriate entry point
3813.16s - 3816.28s |  into parties and meetups.
3816.28s - 3825.33s |  Yeah.
3825.33s - 3826.17s |  Who's that guy on stage?
3826.17s - 3827.69s |  What, you just noticed the patch?
3828.73s - 3829.57s |  Hey, I'm Log.
3829.57s - 3831.69s |  I am the parties and meetups lead.
3831.69s - 3833.17s |  Quick show of hands.
3833.17s - 3835.61s |  Who all attended one of our awesome parties
3835.61s - 3837.05s |  and meetups this weekend?
3837.97s - 3843.01s |  Hell yeah.
3843.01s - 3844.81s |  We just want to thank everyone for hosting a meetup
3844.81s - 3846.37s |  first off.
3846.37s - 3849.25s |  Absolutely, you can really need it in the community.
3849.25s - 3852.13s |  Great places to go to meet up with your DC groups,
3852.17s - 3855.69s |  with just random people that you have interests with.
3855.69s - 3859.93s |  Also, thank you everyone for hosting a party as well.
3859.93s - 3861.81s |  Absolutely amazing time.
3861.81s - 3864.25s |  Loved every single minute of it.
3864.25s - 3868.05s |  You guys absolutely know how to actually throw
3868.05s - 3869.29s |  and run a party.
3871.05s - 3874.42s |  Nope.
3874.42s - 3875.62s |  Talk about any, yeah.
3875.62s - 3878.14s |  Any exciting stories about parties?
3878.14s - 3880.10s |  No, I just think it went to a different slide.
3880.10s - 3880.94s |  Yeah.
3881.82s - 3883.74s |  But do you have any more to say?
3883.74s - 3886.22s |  No, I do want to say some thank yous real quick.
3886.22s - 3889.10s |  I do want to say a thank you definitely to Nikita, Jeff,
3889.10s - 3890.46s |  for helping us throw this out.
3890.46s - 3894.34s |  Kev Ops and the wonderful official Kev Ops department.
3894.34s - 3896.30s |  It's not an official department.
3896.30s - 3899.02s |  Thank you Nikita for the food truck village.
3899.02s - 3901.30s |  I also want to thank all my goons.
3904.46s - 3905.62s |  I want to thank all my goons.
3905.62s - 3910.62s |  SecFault, Rick, Sage, Heaven, Subaru, Silicon, and Data.
3911.46s - 3912.98s |  You guys absolutely rocked it.
3912.98s - 3915.06s |  You guys absolutely helped everything out
3915.66s - 3916.50s |  and without you guys,
3916.50s - 3918.78s |  none of the parties would have any equipment.
3918.78s - 3921.02s |  Thank you Defcon A&E as well.
3921.02s - 3923.74s |  And also thank you to the world famous exhibitors department
3923.74s - 3925.78s |  for lending us all the goons we needed
3925.78s - 3927.34s |  whenever we were short-staffed.
3933.10s - 3936.46s |  And next year, if you guys want to throw a party
3936.46s - 3938.70s |  or a meetup, or if you have any feedback
3938.70s - 3940.90s |  about the parties or meetups this year,
3940.90s - 3942.86s |  be on the lookout for the call for parties
3942.86s - 3945.90s |  and email parties at defcon.org.
3945.90s - 3952.50s |  Thank you.
3952.50s - 3954.06s |  He looks really familiar.
3955.34s - 3956.70s |  Dark tangent.
3956.70s - 3959.10s |  Okay, video team.
3960.34s - 3961.74s |  Video team?
3962.82s - 3965.38s |  I see some of the video team.
3965.38s - 3967.66s |  Okay, well then I'll talk about the video team.
3967.66s - 3969.86s |  So if Darrington's not up here.
3971.10s - 3972.70s |  So there's a video team,
3973.58s - 3977.18s |  handcrafted artisanal video creators
3978.14s - 3980.06s |  that you might've seen wearing shirts.
3981.46s - 3982.30s |  I hope.
3983.02s - 3985.74s |  And anyway, this is kind of an outgrowth
3985.74s - 3987.26s |  of reaching out into the community
3987.26s - 3988.82s |  and finding people who've been,
3988.82s - 3991.58s |  have experience building like shorts.
3991.58s - 3994.18s |  And this is, I think the third year we're doing it.
3994.18s - 3995.22s |  And what we really try to do
3995.22s - 3997.70s |  is capture behind the scenes moments,
3997.70s - 3999.26s |  more than just a picture.
4000.10s - 4003.38s |  We wanted to really like empower a group of people
4003.38s - 4005.02s |  sort of as internal Defcon
4006.66s - 4009.06s |  badged representatives that would go out
4009.06s - 4011.30s |  and capture good stories from the community.
4011.30s - 4012.46s |  What are you doing in this village?
4013.30s - 4016.34s |  Tell me about this cool aviation simulation.
4016.34s - 4018.66s |  And really capturing the stories that like,
4018.66s - 4020.58s |  I don't get to see.
4020.58s - 4023.38s |  So I can watch them all and feel like I saw my own con.
4025.30s - 4027.70s |  And the idea then is to have these,
4027.70s - 4029.78s |  you wanna show somebody what's the con all about,
4029.78s - 4032.46s |  like a mini documentary of all the things that happened.
4032.46s - 4036.82s |  And so all these have been recorded and captured.
4036.82s - 4039.10s |  They're being edited and uploaded
4039.10s - 4040.62s |  and we'll start releasing them as shorts
4040.62s - 4041.74s |  on our YouTube channel.
4041.78s - 4044.14s |  And then they'll end up on the media server.
4044.14s - 4049.14s |  So I wanna thank all of the video team for doing this
4049.14s - 4053.98s |  because you're really allowing the preservation
4053.98s - 4055.34s |  of some of the spirit of Defcon
4055.34s - 4057.86s |  that's not captured in either the music recordings
4057.86s - 4058.74s |  or the talk recording.
4058.74s - 4060.06s |  So thank you very much.
4060.06s - 4067.40s |  Give them a round of applause.
4067.40s - 4069.76s |  So next up will be communities.
4069.76s - 4074.90s |  Communities.
4074.90s - 4077.30s |  Someone represent, there he is.
4077.30s - 4085.17s |  Right on.
4085.17s - 4086.09s |  Hello, I'm Pedro.
4086.09s - 4087.77s |  I'm not actually the communities lead,
4087.77s - 4090.49s |  but I was working hand in hand with Chef
4090.49s - 4092.57s |  who is our first year communities lead.
4092.57s - 4096.01s |  He's also accompanied by Seams and Fork.
4096.01s - 4099.77s |  They serviced and assisted with the facilitation
4099.77s - 4101.81s |  and logistics for 13 communities,
4101.81s - 4105.01s |  which is a new department we've been working on.
4105.01s - 4109.81s |  Well, by we, I mean, Nikita has been working on defining,
4109.81s - 4112.77s |  getting it started, getting them spaces
4112.77s - 4115.81s |  and giving them the opportunity to grow organically
4116.49s - 4119.45s |  to hopefully continue on with Defcon.
4120.57s - 4131.53s |  I'm gonna end it there just for the sake of time.
4131.53s - 4133.17s |  If you want to start a community
4133.17s - 4136.05s |  or you think you've got a large enough affinity group,
4136.05s - 4139.53s |  just apply like any other contest, village or event,
4139.53s - 4141.33s |  and we'll try to make space for you.
4142.89s - 4146.85s |  Villages, a big, big department.
4146.85s - 4147.81s |  Come on down.
4154.57s - 4157.41s |  You guys will notice that Pedro's back.
4158.41s - 4160.53s |  He's got a longer list of things to say this time,
4160.53s - 4161.77s |  so I apologize now.
4163.49s - 4167.41s |  So we'd first like to start off with some stats.
4167.41s - 4169.41s |  So there's 34 total villages.
4169.41s - 4170.81s |  We're counting communities underneath us
4170.81s - 4172.69s |  because it was the on-ramp year form and stuff too.
4172.69s - 4174.53s |  And we definitely helped Chef
4174.53s - 4176.37s |  with his facilitation for this year.
4176.37s - 4178.29s |  And then also this is the first year
4178.29s - 4179.97s |  that we had the creator stages.
4179.97s - 4184.13s |  So Ray's behind us as well, helped lead that.
4184.13s - 4185.13s |  Huh?
4185.17s - 4188.25s |  I'm sorry, Ray's Ops, specifically.
4188.25s - 4191.25s |  May or may not be in direct competition with Kev Ops.
4192.77s - 4195.37s |  Did just an outstanding, spectacular job.
4195.37s - 4196.41s |  I don't want to steal his thunder,
4196.41s - 4198.61s |  so I won't talk about it too much.
4198.61s - 4200.33s |  But definitely want to do a special thanks
4200.33s - 4202.01s |  to all the village leads,
4202.01s - 4204.01s |  all the volunteers within the villages.
4205.49s - 4209.25s |  You guys encompass around 660,000 square feet.
4209.25s - 4210.45s |  That is Defcon.
4210.45s - 4212.25s |  Unfortunately for us,
4212.29s - 4215.49s |  it's in a 1.4 million square foot facilities.
4215.49s - 4217.61s |  That means that we have to run all over the place
4217.61s - 4219.41s |  because it's not all consolidated in one place.
4219.41s - 4222.61s |  So our goons definitely get a lot of steps in,
4222.61s - 4224.49s |  but I'll let Pedro go next.
4226.01s - 4227.81s |  So first of all, I'd like to start
4227.81s - 4232.05s |  with 128 page PowerPoint presentation on what went wrong.
4233.13s - 4235.37s |  Before I go, what I would like to do
4235.37s - 4240.37s |  is give a special thanks out to DT, Janet,
4240.37s - 4242.25s |  Nikita and Neil and their minions
4242.25s - 4243.69s |  who chased me around the con.
4244.77s - 4248.13s |  A null value for the hacker tracker stuff.
4248.13s - 4250.93s |  Raisin meat for the creator stages.
4250.93s - 4253.85s |  Bruiser, he's our official cat wrangler.
4254.73s - 4258.37s |  Chef, Seams and Forked for communities work.
4258.37s - 4262.23s |  Fox, Flex and Honey for all the administrative assists.
4262.23s - 4265.13s |  Honestly, without that help, we would have quit.
4265.13s - 4266.61s |  All of our village goons,
4266.61s - 4269.85s |  all of the Defcon departments for their assistance,
4269.85s - 4271.21s |  all of the content creators
4271.21s - 4274.31s |  because nobody would come to Defcon if there wasn't content.
4275.31s - 4276.69s |  Definitely want to give a shout out
4276.69s - 4278.37s |  to our friends and families for putting up
4278.37s - 4281.49s |  with the last minute calls, last minute emergencies
4281.49s - 4286.49s |  and all the sacrifices made to get this show on the road.
4286.51s - 4288.89s |  Finally, a special shout out.
4288.89s - 4290.89s |  I want to give a really big shout out to Nina
4290.89s - 4298.59s |  from biohacking and her mom.
4298.59s - 4299.95s |  One last thing I'd like to say
4299.95s - 4302.39s |  is I'd like to give a shout out to Irf.
4302.39s - 4306.03s |  He's a first time Defconner that showed up.
4306.03s - 4307.35s |  He helped villages.
4307.35s - 4309.59s |  He was running cable at Packet Hacking
4309.59s - 4311.31s |  and he definitely was doing Defcon
4311.31s - 4318.65s |  the way it should be done.
4318.65s - 4319.95s |  Well, first off, I want us,
4319.95s - 4322.07s |  everyone should thank Honey and Pedro
4322.07s - 4323.23s |  if you enjoyed the villages
4323.23s - 4325.87s |  because there was a ton of work behind the scenes
4325.87s - 4326.69s |  that they've been doing.
4326.69s - 4334.37s |  So please.
4334.37s - 4335.85s |  All right, so you might've noticed
4335.85s - 4337.89s |  there was four creator stages this year,
4337.89s - 4339.35s |  also known as Raise Ops.
4340.57s - 4343.03s |  But the creator stages are for villages
4343.07s - 4345.83s |  and communities to use as talk tracks.
4345.83s - 4349.79s |  This year we had 70 hours of contents recorded
4349.79s - 4352.71s |  and almost 150 speakers.
4352.71s - 4356.05s |  So please thank the speakers when you see them.
4356.05s - 4364.78s |  They had some great talks.
4364.78s - 4367.10s |  And then, yeah, thanks to the village goons,
4367.10s - 4368.62s |  especially my second year meet.
4368.62s - 4370.06s |  And thank you all.
4370.06s - 4371.02s |  See you all next year.
4371.02s - 4373.98s |  Appreciate it.
4373.98s - 4375.18s |  See you all next year.
4376.42s - 4378.90s |  And creators, I will miss our weekly calls.
4378.90s - 4380.78s |  I will not be on them for a good while.
4381.42s - 4383.08s |  See you guys some point next year.
4386.56s - 4398.84s |  Okay, so now we have merch.
4398.84s - 4400.00s |  Hello, DEF CON.
4400.00s - 4401.36s |  Who all waited in the merch line
4401.36s - 4403.46s |  at some point this weekend?
4403.46s - 4404.30s |  Yeah, it shows.
4405.24s - 4407.44s |  Thank you all for your patience in dealing with us.
4407.44s - 4410.12s |  We had quite a few people in line this year
4410.12s - 4412.92s |  and we were moving people through faster than ever.
4412.92s - 4414.04s |  After last year,
4414.04s - 4416.40s |  I was working on improving stuff on our backend,
4416.40s - 4420.28s |  so our changes weren't as visible probably
4420.32s - 4423.40s |  as the new ordering system we introduced last year.
4423.40s - 4425.64s |  But we were able to speed up a number of things.
4425.64s - 4429.40s |  We had a 13% faster order velocity year over year
4429.40s - 4430.60s |  from last year,
4430.60s - 4434.08s |  which kind of belays how much merchandise we were moving out
4434.08s - 4436.06s |  because we were actually moving out items
4436.06s - 4438.00s |  at a faster rate too.
4438.00s - 4440.88s |  Items were 18% faster than last year,
4440.88s - 4443.10s |  which I think is speaking to the hard work
4443.10s - 4445.16s |  that our friends at the Hacker Tracker did
4445.16s - 4447.44s |  to get the wishlist and the app
4447.44s - 4449.16s |  and the items available to you all to look at
4449.16s - 4450.18s |  so people can pull orders.
4451.08s - 4453.38s |  And less people have to stand in line.
4453.38s - 4456.42s |  This year, we had a new record for the largest order
4456.42s - 4459.38s |  at 49 items.
4459.38s - 4460.98s |  It was actually a three-way tie.
4461.82s - 4464.94s |  The first shirt that sold the size it sold out
4464.94s - 4467.78s |  was at 11 o'clock almost on Thursday.
4467.78s - 4468.98s |  The first item sold out-
4468.98s - 4470.00s |  What size was it?
4471.38s - 4472.24s |  Women's small.
4477.97s - 4482.77s |  The first full item sold out was at Thursday at 7.49.
4482.81s - 4485.09s |  So we actually had stuff in stock for longer
4485.09s - 4486.45s |  than we had last year,
4486.45s - 4489.41s |  thanks to the great ordering that was done
4489.41s - 4493.43s |  by Amar and the folks at DEF CON headquarters.
4493.43s - 4494.27s |  What was it?
4494.27s - 4495.09s |  What sold out?
4495.09s - 4496.09s |  The water bottle.
4500.47s - 4504.59s |  Highest number of goon steps was 37,677.
4504.59s - 4506.55s |  My blisters will show that
4506.55s - 4508.95s |  if anybody needs to see them later.
4508.95s - 4511.99s |  And we had two goons who went to the ER
4511.99s - 4514.51s |  but still showed up for their shifts the next day.
4514.51s - 4516.59s |  Unrelated to anything that happened here.
4520.40s - 4523.38s |  I'd just like to thank everybody from DEF CON headquarters,
4523.38s - 4526.24s |  DT, Janet, Nikita, Mar,
4526.24s - 4529.60s |  for making sure that things get to us,
4529.60s - 4531.56s |  get ordered and everything for us.
4531.56s - 4533.36s |  QM for getting this stuff to us.
4533.36s - 4534.92s |  Hacker Tracker folks for making
4534.92s - 4537.28s |  the electronic ordering work.
4537.28s - 4539.24s |  And everybody who was patient waiting in line.
4539.24s - 4546.03s |  Thank you very much.
4546.03s - 4547.51s |  And I think it goes without saying
4547.51s - 4551.15s |  that we'll continue to improve the speed.
4551.15s - 4552.55s |  And now that we're in the new space
4552.55s - 4554.55s |  and we kind of understand how it works,
4554.55s - 4555.91s |  we're gonna try to get really creative
4555.91s - 4558.85s |  for other ways to accelerate the merch experience.
4560.03s - 4561.91s |  So Demo Labs.
4561.91s - 4564.63s |  Not a workshop, not a talk.
4564.63s - 4570.02s |  It's a Demo Lab.
4570.02s - 4570.86s |  Thanks everybody.
4570.86s - 4573.42s |  I'm Heisenberg.
4573.42s - 4575.70s |  They've been the lead of Demo Labs for a while.
4575.70s - 4577.22s |  I know exactly where I am
4577.26s - 4580.12s |  but I'm not quite sure of my momentum.
4580.12s - 4582.22s |  The physics joke in DEF CON.
4582.22s - 4583.66s |  Good, okay.
4583.66s - 4585.86s |  It has been a privilege to lead Demo Labs
4585.86s - 4587.26s |  for about the last seven years.
4587.26s - 4589.58s |  I'm joined up here on stage with my seconds
4589.58s - 4591.58s |  for this year, Verbal and Harold.
4591.58s - 4593.62s |  How many of you all went to Demo Lab,
4593.62s - 4596.18s |  at least one Demo Lab this year?
4596.18s - 4597.02s |  Fantastic.
4597.02s - 4598.44s |  I see a decent show of hands.
4598.44s - 4599.34s |  Very good.
4599.34s - 4601.66s |  For those of you who don't know what Demo Labs is,
4601.66s - 4603.54s |  we put out a call for papers every year
4603.54s - 4605.66s |  just like a call for Demo Labs,
4605.66s - 4606.86s |  just like the call for papers,
4606.86s - 4608.50s |  like all the other calls.
4608.50s - 4611.54s |  And this year we got around 100 calls,
4611.54s - 4614.82s |  or 100 proposals, and we down-select.
4614.82s - 4618.02s |  This year we down-selected down to 36 Demo Labs.
4618.02s - 4620.18s |  And the whole purpose of Demo Labs
4620.18s - 4622.36s |  is to give you, the community,
4622.36s - 4625.54s |  the opportunity to engage with the creator
4625.54s - 4627.06s |  of that particular project.
4627.06s - 4629.78s |  Maybe it's a framework, maybe it's a tool,
4629.78s - 4631.78s |  maybe it's some kind of a technique,
4631.78s - 4634.82s |  maybe it's something that's still kind of an idea
4634.82s - 4638.26s |  and it's getting worked on and it's sort of in process,
4638.26s - 4641.78s |  but we really wanna give you the opportunity to interact.
4641.78s - 4643.42s |  The whole purpose of Demo Labs
4643.42s - 4645.64s |  is to foster this collaboration.
4645.64s - 4647.98s |  It's deliberately a small space.
4647.98s - 4652.34s |  We ask the presenters to rotate every 30 minutes or so,
4652.34s - 4657.02s |  so that that way, even though it's a fairly small space,
4657.02s - 4658.94s |  and even though we had a few lines,
4658.94s - 4660.74s |  everybody got a chance to get in
4660.74s - 4662.82s |  and interact with the presenter
4662.82s - 4666.54s |  and have an opportunity to collaborate.
4666.54s - 4670.58s |  So I'd like to also give a shout-out to the Demo Lab crew.
4670.58s - 4672.62s |  We have a crew this year.
4672.62s - 4674.66s |  So if you see us in the white lab coats,
4674.66s - 4676.00s |  those are the Demo Lab goons,
4676.00s - 4679.30s |  and so thanks to all of them for taking care of that.
4679.30s - 4682.08s |  And kind of reflecting back,
4682.08s - 4683.82s |  it's been really a privilege to,
4683.82s - 4685.58s |  there's two things that I kind of think of
4685.58s - 4687.10s |  as I reflect back on it.
4687.10s - 4689.26s |  One of them is, I remember when Demo Labs
4689.26s - 4692.44s |  was just a 19-inch monitor sitting on a table
4693.06s - 4694.36s |  in the middle of a crowded hallway, right?
4694.36s - 4695.60s |  You remember that?
4695.60s - 4700.60s |  So with DT and Grifter and Nikita's support,
4700.60s - 4702.60s |  we've turned Demo Labs into,
4702.60s - 4705.36s |  been able to evolve it into a destination event
4705.36s - 4707.88s |  on par with all of the other really cool things
4707.88s - 4708.92s |  that everybody's doing,
4708.92s - 4710.90s |  and it also is a shout-out to all you
4710.90s - 4715.80s |  who submitted papers or submitted proposals for Demo Labs.
4715.80s - 4719.12s |  So I think the other thing that I really want to mention
4719.12s - 4721.20s |  about Demo Labs, which has been something that's cool,
4721.20s - 4724.76s |  having been involved for seven, eight years or so,
4724.76s - 4727.84s |  is we see a project come in,
4727.84s - 4729.88s |  and it's really kind of ill-formed,
4729.88s - 4732.04s |  it's sort of kind of in the prototype,
4732.04s - 4733.56s |  I'm thinking about this,
4733.56s - 4736.76s |  and you watch the community engagement happen,
4736.76s - 4739.24s |  the people, and they start talking back and forth,
4739.24s - 4742.28s |  and the presenter, and then the project evolves and evolves,
4742.28s - 4744.88s |  and then a few more years, it comes back,
4744.88s - 4747.84s |  and it's just this outstanding, stellar project
4747.84s - 4750.08s |  that is really launched into the community,
4750.20s - 4754.24s |  and that is all down to you all, and your interactions,
4754.24s - 4757.50s |  and your willingness to help interact with the community.
4757.50s - 4759.44s |  So that has been fantastic.
4759.44s - 4761.88s |  The last thing I want to say is,
4761.88s - 4764.00s |  again, it has been a privilege,
4764.00s - 4766.92s |  Verbal and Harold did an outstanding job as my second,
4766.92s - 4769.72s |  this is my opportunity to take a step back,
4769.72s - 4774.12s |  and so for starting with DEF CON, the next DEF CON,
4774.12s - 4776.80s |  Verbal and Harold will be the leads for Demo Labs.
4776.80s - 4784.27s |  So I want you all to absolutely inundate them
4784.75s - 4787.11s |  with outstanding proposals,
4787.11s - 4789.35s |  so that they have a complete conundrum.
4789.35s - 4790.79s |  That would just be awesome.
4790.79s - 4798.60s |  Thank you very much.
4798.60s - 4800.92s |  Okay, you might have noticed the giant glowing box
4800.92s - 4803.88s |  that was the DARPA AI Cyber Challenge.
4804.76s - 4806.44s |  I am not sure if we,
4806.44s - 4810.22s |  do we have someone from DARPA AI Cyber Challenge?
4814.36s - 4816.36s |  I know we were trying to find Perry.
4817.36s - 4818.92s |  But if Perry couldn't make it,
4820.36s - 4822.08s |  I will tell you that as year one
4822.08s - 4824.64s |  of the second two-year contest,
4824.64s - 4827.40s |  this year was essentially the qualifiers.
4827.40s - 4829.34s |  Next year will be the finals.
4829.34s - 4832.68s |  I am told that next year, the space you saw
4832.68s - 4834.32s |  will continue to evolve,
4834.32s - 4837.54s |  and is going to get even more complicated and awesome.
4837.54s - 4842.00s |  And this year, the pre-qualifiers happen before the event.
4842.00s - 4844.62s |  Next year, the finals will happen at the event.
4844.70s - 4845.54s |  So it'll be much more
4845.54s - 4849.82s |  of a sort of spectator observation next year.
4849.82s - 4851.22s |  So you'll be able to really see
4851.22s - 4854.18s |  what the teams are doing, unlike this year.
4854.18s - 4855.58s |  So that is gonna be cool.
4855.58s - 4859.82s |  It'll be the final phase of the AI Challenge.
4860.66s - 4864.76s |  Okay, next up, Grifter, lead of contests.
4873.58s - 4875.18s |  Hey, everybody.
4875.18s - 4877.86s |  So, hi, you specifically.
4878.30s - 4883.93s |  Um, so we had quite a few contests this year.
4883.93s - 4888.93s |  We actually, we received well over 100 contest submissions.
4890.65s - 4895.09s |  And we took 89 contests and events,
4895.09s - 4896.49s |  official contests and events.
4896.49s - 4898.85s |  There are actually more that took place.
4898.85s - 4901.87s |  Like, we don't have, you know,
4901.87s - 4905.31s |  an official designation for two idiots
4905.31s - 4907.73s |  hitting each other in inflatable dinosaur suits,
4907.73s - 4909.93s |  but it happens, right?
4909.93s - 4911.93s |  I don't know who those people are,
4911.93s - 4913.17s |  but they should get help.
4915.21s - 4919.09s |  You lost, um, anyway.
4919.09s - 4922.69s |  So, this year though, every year I always say,
4922.69s - 4924.73s |  if you have an idea for a contest or an event
4924.73s - 4927.17s |  that you wanna pull off, please submit.
4927.17s - 4929.85s |  Like, try to come, come up with something new.
4929.85s - 4931.49s |  If there's something that you experience,
4931.49s - 4935.79s |  then you feel like, you know, this, this can,
4935.79s - 4937.25s |  I can do this better.
4937.65s - 4940.17s |  Do it then, prove it, right?
4940.17s - 4944.89s |  But this year we had 19 new contests and events out there.
4944.89s - 4947.81s |  So, thank you so much to all the new folks
4947.81s - 4949.13s |  who put some skin in the game
4949.13s - 4951.97s |  and created something interesting for you.
4953.41s - 4958.29s |  Um, I do wanna point something out while I'm up here.
4958.29s - 4961.97s |  So, the number one question that my goons are asked,
4961.97s - 4964.97s |  and thank you, thank you to all the contests and events goons
4964.97s - 4968.31s |  who are making sure that this thing goes off,
4968.31s - 4971.29s |  is they get asked, have you seen Grifter,
4971.29s - 4973.49s |  or where is Grifter?
4973.49s - 4975.81s |  Now, I'm usually running around,
4975.81s - 4977.53s |  talking to the contest, trying to figure out
4977.53s - 4979.93s |  who is going to get the black badge
4979.93s - 4981.55s |  at the end of the show, right?
4981.55s - 4984.49s |  So, interviewing them, talking to competitors,
4984.49s - 4985.65s |  that kind of thing.
4985.65s - 4989.69s |  And so, they made me a hacker tracker.
4991.17s - 4993.77s |  It says, definitely not a tracker,
4993.77s - 4995.49s |  but then there's a tile in it,
4995.49s - 4997.33s |  so it's definitely a tracker.
4997.33s - 4999.05s |  And I carried this all weekend,
4999.05s - 5001.81s |  and we shared a link on our group chat.
5001.81s - 5004.77s |  So, at any point, they could push a button
5004.77s - 5006.59s |  and see where Grifter was.
5007.81s - 5012.65s |  It did go off at 3.30 in the morning, on Saturday morning,
5012.65s - 5015.53s |  and I was like, you creepy bastards.
5015.53s - 5020.53s |  But yeah, I was in my hotel room, come find me.
5020.73s - 5022.05s |  Come find me.
5023.61s - 5026.85s |  All right, again, huge thanks to all the creators,
5026.85s - 5028.69s |  everybody who put the time in,
5028.69s - 5031.53s |  and for all of the competitors.
5031.53s - 5034.61s |  Honestly, these contests and events really create
5034.61s - 5036.89s |  the atmosphere that is DEF CON.
5036.89s - 5039.21s |  You may not realize that when you experience
5039.21s - 5041.29s |  something odd in the hallway,
5041.29s - 5043.35s |  or see somebody wandering around
5043.35s - 5045.17s |  with some weird contraption,
5045.17s - 5047.43s |  that that's just somebody playing a game.
5048.43s - 5053.43s |  So, again, I truly believe that the contests and events
5053.75s - 5056.59s |  are part of the soul of DEF CON.
5056.59s - 5060.37s |  Our motto is not one talk, not even one, right?
5060.37s - 5061.95s |  Watch them later on YouTube, it's fine.
5061.95s - 5063.83s |  Actually, don't, because we need you in here
5063.83s - 5065.43s |  and not in the hallway.
5065.43s - 5070.43s |  But like I said, please participate, create,
5070.55s - 5074.19s |  and continue to put together amazing things.
5074.27s - 5077.91s |  Huge thanks to DT, of course, for throwing this party.
5078.91s - 5083.91s |  To Janet, to Neil, Darrington, and all the DEF CON HQ,
5084.15s - 5087.83s |  but especially to Nikita, who,
5087.83s - 5093.91s |  yes, give her a round of applause,
5093.91s - 5097.75s |  who shares many, many phone calls with me,
5097.75s - 5102.33s |  and probably thousands of text messages throughout a year.
5102.33s - 5105.71s |  The voicemail I got on Friday morning,
5105.71s - 5107.39s |  yeah, I'm gonna say it.
5107.39s - 5109.39s |  She left me a voicemail and she said,
5109.39s - 5111.99s |  Grifter, my brother in Christ,
5111.99s - 5114.63s |  if you do not answer this phone
5114.63s - 5117.23s |  or call me back in the next 10 minutes,
5117.23s - 5122.19s |  I'm going to hurt you, a lot.
5123.45s - 5124.85s |  And I got back in five minutes.
5124.85s - 5125.85s |  I'm like, am I in the time?
5125.85s - 5128.11s |  She's like, mm-hmm, so close.
5129.29s - 5133.11s |  So, yes, thank you, Nikita, so much for your support,
5133.11s - 5135.45s |  not only here, but as a friend
5135.45s - 5137.29s |  and in my personal life as well.
5137.29s - 5140.05s |  Thank you to all of you for also being my friends,
5140.05s - 5141.85s |  and I appreciate it.
5141.85s - 5143.59s |  If you have an idea for a contest,
5143.59s - 5145.41s |  the call goes out in January.
5145.41s - 5156.66s |  We'll see you then.
5156.66s - 5163.03s |  Actually, so, is Jeff back?
5163.03s - 5163.87s |  You're back.
5163.87s - 5164.71s |  Do you wanna talk about the?
5164.71s - 5166.63s |  Yeah, okay, Mar, come on up, Mar.
5166.63s - 5170.43s |  So, what I've got around my neck here,
5170.43s - 5171.69s |  if you wanna take a picture,
5171.69s - 5174.05s |  this is the Uber badge this year,
5175.39s - 5177.99s |  and Mar's gonna tell you a little bit
5177.99s - 5183.32s |  about its construction and what makes it special.
5183.32s - 5185.60s |  All right, so, I wanted to capture
5185.60s - 5189.04s |  the glitz and glam of Las Vegas,
5189.04s - 5192.96s |  so I collaborated with my sister, Amy Valentine,
5192.96s - 5195.92s |  and she spent hours and hours
5195.92s - 5198.88s |  hand-placing all of these little glass jewels.
5198.88s - 5200.12s |  In addition to the glass jewels,
5200.12s - 5204.80s |  there is also Swarovski crystals, glass crystals,
5204.80s - 5207.44s |  and there's uranium glass,
5207.44s - 5212.44s |  which is a nod to Las Vegas's atomic history,
5212.48s - 5217.28s |  and a previous black badge that inspired me by Lost,
5217.28s - 5218.64s |  if y'all remember that one.
5220.00s - 5221.92s |  The veins are a gold leaf,
5221.92s - 5224.04s |  which is sort of an expression of the natural history
5224.04s - 5225.40s |  of the place that we're in.
5226.36s - 5227.84s |  Yeah, so the uranium glass,
5227.84s - 5229.44s |  it's a little green eyeball right there,
5229.44s - 5231.52s |  and if, yeah, we checked it out in the bathroom earlier
5231.52s - 5233.80s |  with a UV light, it was really cool.
5233.80s - 5244.04s |  There you go.
5244.04s - 5247.72s |  So each one, as you heard, is hand-crafted,
5247.72s - 5251.92s |  and when you earn, you don't win a gold badge,
5251.92s - 5253.96s |  you earn a gold badge.
5255.32s - 5257.72s |  Or, yeah, I'm sorry, gold, look at me,
5257.72s - 5259.90s |  I'm just like, oh, that's awesome.
5260.90s - 5262.20s |  Gold badges are different.
5263.08s - 5265.16s |  An uber badge, a black badge,
5265.16s - 5268.26s |  and it allows you to enter DEF CON for life,
5268.26s - 5270.20s |  which is like a pretty big commitment,
5270.20s - 5275.20s |  and we give them out every year
5275.76s - 5280.28s |  to contests that we think have reached a certain threshold,
5280.28s - 5283.72s |  and the only contest that gets it for sure every year
5283.72s - 5284.92s |  is Capture the Flag.
5285.88s - 5287.92s |  But beyond that, it's a mystery.
5287.92s - 5292.08s |  Who will be a black badge event?
5292.08s - 5293.76s |  And to answer that mystery,
5293.76s - 5304.71s |  I welcome back up to the stage, Grifter.
5304.71s - 5305.95s |  I'm gonna do it.
5307.39s - 5309.63s |  Yeah, I'm doing it, yep, there it is.
5309.63s - 5312.07s |  So anyway, here's the actual text message,
5312.07s - 5315.03s |  which I censored a little, or the actual voicemail.
5315.03s - 5316.71s |  Grifter, my brother in Christ,
5316.71s - 5319.31s |  if you do not fucking call me back in the next 10 minutes,
5319.31s - 5321.79s |  I'm gonna find somebody to shit in your hotel room
5321.79s - 5324.79s |  every day for the next week.
5324.79s - 5343.05s |  Okay, love you, bye.
5343.05s - 5343.89s |  That's my girl.
5348.15s - 5351.61s |  And she would, actually, she has that kind of authority.
5352.57s - 5356.41s |  All right, so first off,
5356.41s - 5360.93s |  we'll start with a longtime black badge earning contest.
5360.93s - 5365.93s |  A few years ago, I had a conversation with Riverside
5366.25s - 5369.25s |  about upping the ante with Capture the Packet.
5369.25s - 5371.65s |  I felt like it was getting to a place
5371.65s - 5375.09s |  where it needed a little notch up, it had to get harder,
5375.09s - 5379.53s |  and he really, really took that to the next level,
5379.53s - 5383.59s |  to the point that this year, I said, hey, man, relax.
5385.09s - 5387.67s |  But incredible challenges and incredible time.
5387.67s - 5390.01s |  I'll have him come up here and tell you about that,
5390.01s - 5400.32s |  Capture the Packet.
5400.32s - 5401.84s |  I'll do my best with my voice.
5402.84s - 5405.92s |  This new venue has been really hard with all the audio.
5405.92s - 5408.04s |  So I'm Riverside.
5408.04s - 5411.20s |  I just wanna thank everybody that made this one possible.
5411.20s - 5412.70s |  It was really challenging.
5412.70s - 5414.98s |  The PHV team, WOS DJ Co,
5414.98s - 5417.44s |  and especially all of the DEF CON staff here
5417.44s - 5418.88s |  and the attendees to make it happen.
5418.88s - 5419.72s |  So thank you all.
5419.72s - 5421.00s |  I just wanna give you a hand.
5421.00s - 5421.84s |  It was hard.
5425.98s - 5430.78s |  We also changed the format of our prelims and our mains.
5430.78s - 5433.02s |  So normally we would have a time and go, one, two, three,
5433.02s - 5435.30s |  go, and then everybody's going.
5435.30s - 5437.22s |  And our prelims, we just left it open.
5437.22s - 5440.14s |  You sit down and you get a certain amount of time
5440.14s - 5441.78s |  from the time you start to go.
5441.78s - 5444.46s |  So we were able to get a ton of teams in
5444.46s - 5446.66s |  and it was pretty amazing.
5446.66s - 5449.06s |  And we had so much fresh blood
5449.50s - 5452.98s |  and we had some people, the team here,
5452.98s - 5457.54s |  that has been competing now 13 years in a row.
5459.90s - 5462.46s |  I wanna kind of give them just a couple of seconds
5462.46s - 5466.42s |  to also touch on from a competitor standpoint,
5466.42s - 5468.66s |  the differences that Grifter just touched on.
5470.70s - 5471.54s |  Go ahead.
5471.54s - 5472.36s |  Yeah.
5473.46s - 5474.38s |  Thanks everybody.
5475.22s - 5477.02s |  Basically we're here because of this community
5477.02s - 5478.46s |  and what we've learned from all of you over the years.
5479.30s - 5481.50s |  But what they've done in the Captured Packet Village
5481.50s - 5483.02s |  and with the contest, it's gotten tougher.
5483.02s - 5485.06s |  We've played 13 years now.
5485.06s - 5485.90s |  Great fun.
5485.90s - 5488.04s |  It's gotten tougher every single year.
5488.04s - 5489.14s |  They keep challenging us.
5489.14s - 5490.30s |  The gameplay gets better.
5490.30s - 5491.90s |  The system gets better.
5491.90s - 5493.18s |  The challenges get harder
5493.18s - 5495.08s |  and force us to learn more every single year.
5495.08s - 5497.04s |  So we always go away scratching our heads,
5497.04s - 5499.14s |  trying to learn more and come back the next year better.
5499.14s - 5501.30s |  But it's all because of their hard work.
5501.30s - 5503.46s |  And it's just been a blast to play all these years
5503.46s - 5506.22s |  and just really appreciate everything y'all do for us.
5506.22s - 5508.38s |  Yeah.
5508.58s - 5512.30s |  Um, let's see.
5512.30s - 5515.48s |  I think that the things that I want to go over is
5515.48s - 5520.48s |  in third place was Vimwaffles with 320 points.
5524.30s - 5526.62s |  Second place NightSec with 720.
5526.62s - 5531.62s |  And then the first place, the ChatGPT team with 1,220 points.
5532.58s - 5535.06s |  And so give them a hand.
5535.06s - 5535.90s |  Good job.
5536.86s - 5547.58s |  Thank you guys.
5547.58s - 5548.42s |  Thanks everyone.
5548.42s - 5564.54s |  Have a good DEF CON.
5564.54s - 5565.38s |  All right.
5565.38s - 5568.76s |  This, this next contest is only in its second year,
5569.62s - 5574.62s |  but the creator, AJ had put in one of our own goons,
5574.86s - 5576.38s |  AJ702.
5576.38s - 5577.22s |  Where you at?
5580.02s - 5582.34s |  Put in a ridiculous amount of work on this.
5582.34s - 5585.78s |  So last year I felt like it had,
5585.78s - 5588.66s |  it had sense of the mystery challenge.
5588.66s - 5593.46s |  And then this year it really felt like that.
5593.46s - 5596.58s |  It was the kind of contest that brought all aspects
5596.58s - 5599.78s |  of what it means to be a hacker together.
5599.78s - 5604.78s |  Puzzles, crypto, phone freaking, hacking, all of it.
5605.34s - 5607.02s |  And I'll let them come up here and talk about it,
5607.02s - 5613.03s |  but proud of you, girl.
5613.03s - 5615.67s |  Hello, I am AJ and this,
5615.67s - 5617.79s |  these were the creators of the cube.
5618.63s - 5620.03s |  Closer.
5620.03s - 5620.87s |  Okay.
5620.87s - 5622.75s |  So the inspiration for the cube actually came
5622.75s - 5625.35s |  from my first year at DEF CON where I engaged
5625.35s - 5628.79s |  with a goon named Romer and he impressed upon me
5628.79s - 5630.75s |  the importance of no matter if it's your first year
5630.75s - 5632.75s |  or your 20th year, you need to engage
5632.75s - 5635.89s |  and bring something to the community that is missing.
5635.89s - 5638.31s |  So a couple of years ago I was watching a movie
5638.31s - 5641.39s |  and it gave me an idea to make kind of like a puzzle box
5641.39s - 5642.23s |  for hackers.
5642.23s - 5644.95s |  So we have physical elements and also digital elements
5644.95s - 5646.95s |  and Romer's not here with us anymore,
5646.95s - 5648.67s |  but I would like to say thank you to him
5648.67s - 5650.75s |  because he's the only reason we're standing on the stage
5650.75s - 5652.23s |  and a special thanks to Nikita
5652.23s - 5654.83s |  for actually seeing our vision and accepting.
5654.83s - 5656.75s |  Thank you so much, Nikita.
5656.75s - 5657.75s |  Okay.
5657.75s - 5658.59s |  Now go ahead.
5660.59s - 5661.71s |  Hello.
5661.71s - 5663.31s |  So there was an incredible amount of work
5663.31s - 5665.63s |  that went into competing.
5665.63s - 5667.63s |  So it came down to the wire.
5667.63s - 5670.75s |  In second place, we had the teams, the misfits.
5670.75s - 5675.47s |  It was actually tied with 53% of the flags pulled.
5675.47s - 5677.55s |  So 53% of completion.
5678.51s - 5680.59s |  So we had to come down to time,
5680.59s - 5683.95s |  which was a two minute difference within the past,
5683.95s - 5685.51s |  within the last two hours.
5685.51s - 5687.63s |  So very, very close.
5689.75s - 5690.59s |  Yeah.
5690.59s - 5692.51s |  Thank you everyone for who competed.
5692.51s - 5694.79s |  Thank you, Grifter and Nikita.
5694.79s - 5697.87s |  But we had our winners, which were the Mega Doomers.
5700.03s - 5700.87s |  Fantastic.
5704.97s - 5708.59s |  There you go, you go ahead.
5708.59s - 5709.43s |  Yeah.
5709.43s - 5711.31s |  They did a lot of work, a lot of lock picking,
5711.31s - 5713.47s |  a lot of crypto, a lot of web stuff,
5713.47s - 5714.63s |  a lot of work went into it,
5714.63s - 5716.07s |  which was phenomenal to see.
5716.07s - 5717.11s |  So thank you.
5721.18s - 5722.86s |  Yeah.
5722.86s - 5725.26s |  Definitely come join the Cube next year.
5725.26s - 5726.26s |  It's amazing.
5735.07s - 5736.19s |  Are there stairs up there?
5736.19s - 5737.03s |  Yeah.
5744.18s - 5745.02s |  All right.
5745.02s - 5746.02s |  This next contest,
5747.02s - 5750.82s |  it made me excited when they submitted.
5750.82s - 5753.38s |  I was really hoping that they would bring it
5753.38s - 5754.50s |  and they brought it.
5755.74s - 5759.78s |  Freak Me had multiple pay phones out on their tables.
5759.78s - 5760.70s |  I don't know if you saw this
5760.70s - 5763.46s |  and had all of these different freaking challenges,
5763.46s - 5765.34s |  which I think brought back,
5765.34s - 5767.82s |  if you've ever competed in something like
5767.82s - 5770.26s |  the TeleFreak Challenge, the TeleChallenge,
5770.26s - 5773.66s |  then you know, like that part of our culture,
5773.70s - 5776.62s |  you can see it on your lanyard, around the space.
5776.62s - 5778.98s |  Like back in the day, computers,
5778.98s - 5780.82s |  for the whippersnappers in here,
5780.82s - 5784.34s |  your computer used to scream into a telephone
5784.34s - 5786.38s |  in order to talk to other computers.
5786.38s - 5788.50s |  They just screamed at each other.
5790.14s - 5792.26s |  And it costs a lot of money to do that.
5792.26s - 5794.22s |  And so sometimes we had to figure out
5794.22s - 5797.70s |  how we could, one, talk to each other very far away.
5797.70s - 5798.86s |  You know, I mean, I'll just say it,
5798.86s - 5801.22s |  like the DEF CON voice bridge,
5801.22s - 5803.30s |  I used to red box into that constantly.
5803.94s - 5806.66s |  That's how I could call Utah from New York, right?
5806.66s - 5810.22s |  So seeing that freak culture here
5810.22s - 5811.74s |  and seeing it celebrated
5811.74s - 5814.50s |  and seeing them bring that to new people,
5814.50s - 5817.14s |  it just, it warms my heart and they brought it.
5817.14s - 5819.42s |  The challenges they had were impressive.
5819.42s - 5821.02s |  I'll let them tell you about it.
5824.72s - 5825.72s |  Awesome, thank you.
5827.16s - 5829.60s |  All right, so Freak Me.
5831.16s - 5832.64s |  Yeah, basically you want to start by saying
5832.64s - 5835.24s |  how honored and blessed we are to be up here on stage
5835.28s - 5838.76s |  with the people we've looked up to for so, so many years.
5838.76s - 5840.40s |  Huge shout out to all the goons.
5840.40s - 5842.48s |  The production you guys put on is amazing.
5842.48s - 5844.44s |  You guys are the reason all this works so well.
5844.44s - 5845.40s |  So thank you all.
5846.28s - 5849.20s |  Freakme.com, so basically we made a CTF
5849.20s - 5852.56s |  that was hosted on the publicly switched telephone network,
5852.56s - 5856.08s |  212-203-4977.
5856.08s - 5857.08s |  Give it a call anytime.
5857.08s - 5858.44s |  We're gonna leave it up after the cons
5858.44s - 5860.48s |  so you guys continue hammering away at it.
5860.48s - 5864.28s |  We basically stuffed about 75 flags inside of a PBX
5864.28s - 5867.80s |  and we are here today to honor the Psychoholics
5867.80s - 5876.90s |  who smashed every single flag in our entire challenge.
5876.90s - 5877.74s |  Thank you all.
5877.74s - 5879.46s |  Look forward to seeing you guys next year.
5884.46s - 5886.74s |  You guys getting tired of getting black badges yet?
5886.74s - 5888.46s |  Not yet, never gets old.
5888.46s - 5889.30s |  All right.
5890.90s - 5893.34s |  Oh, the Psychoholics won another contest.
5893.34s - 5898.06s |  Oh, that's 47 black badges for those guys.
5898.06s - 5899.74s |  I think you have more black badges
5899.74s - 5901.58s |  than people on your crew, right?
5901.58s - 5903.46s |  Is that a fact?
5903.46s - 5904.46s |  Is it a fact?
5904.46s - 5906.14s |  No, but they're saying no.
5906.14s - 5907.54s |  Damn it, so they'll be back.
5909.86s - 5911.18s |  I mean, they are talented.
5912.34s - 5914.42s |  It's unreal, it's unreal.
5914.42s - 5918.42s |  So the next one coming up on stage
5918.42s - 5921.94s |  is the Social Engineering Community CTF.
5922.86s - 5926.02s |  How many people made it out or stood in the line
5926.02s - 5929.02s |  and enjoyed the community aspect of standing in line
5929.02s - 5931.30s |  for the Social Engineering Village?
5931.30s - 5932.82s |  No, all right, great, great, great.
5932.82s - 5936.78s |  Awesome, that line was down the hall, wrapped around,
5936.78s - 5938.30s |  came all the way around the other side.
5938.30s - 5939.74s |  It was something else.
5939.74s - 5941.50s |  They put a lot of effort into it
5941.50s - 5943.50s |  and they do a really, really good job
5943.50s - 5947.18s |  of not only presenting their subject matter,
5947.18s - 5949.50s |  but of entertaining the audience as well.
5949.50s - 5954.26s |  Their staff are charming and good looking,
5954.26s - 5955.46s |  especially you, buddy.
5956.30s - 5958.34s |  And then, like I said,
5958.34s - 5961.02s |  they add aspects to it that are entertaining.
5961.02s - 5962.22s |  So not only you're learning,
5962.22s - 5964.26s |  but everybody is in there laughing.
5964.26s - 5971.78s |  So here they are, the Social Engineering Community.
5971.78s - 5975.78s |  Oh, hello, DEF CON, I'm back and I'm joined with Snow.
5975.78s - 5977.74s |  It's me, JC.
5977.74s - 5979.38s |  Hi, I'm Snow.
5979.38s - 5982.62s |  And we bring you the Social Engineering Community.
5982.62s - 5985.06s |  So this is a huge labor of love.
5985.06s - 5987.66s |  It's a lot of work and I apologize about the lines,
5987.66s - 5988.82s |  but that's just part of it.
5989.18s - 5991.18s |  We gotta try and bring some line games in next year.
5991.18s - 5994.34s |  So I'm going to let Snow talk about the competition,
5994.34s - 5997.54s |  our Social Engineering Community Vishing Competition.
5998.82s - 6000.66s |  All right, so for those of you
6000.66s - 6003.18s |  who are not familiar about the competition,
6003.18s - 6006.06s |  it's not just show up here and do cool shit.
6006.06s - 6010.86s |  We pre-select 14 teams and they spend months
6010.86s - 6012.98s |  doing OSINT and building plans.
6012.98s - 6014.98s |  So much work goes into this
6014.98s - 6017.86s |  before they even step foot into DEF CON.
6017.86s - 6020.98s |  Then once they get here, they spend 22 minutes
6020.98s - 6024.26s |  in our soundproof booth in front of you all
6024.26s - 6028.18s |  placing live vishing calls, which is terrifying.
6030.06s - 6032.74s |  And as Grifter said, we like to up the ante every year.
6032.74s - 6035.74s |  Each year we get a little bit better at what we're doing
6035.74s - 6037.50s |  and then we also push the limits.
6037.50s - 6039.10s |  This year we had a heart rate sensor
6039.10s - 6041.06s |  for the competitors to wear.
6041.06s - 6043.34s |  That was fun to watch going from 80 to one.
6043.34s - 6046.86s |  I think the max was 165 I saw.
6046.86s - 6049.50s |  I felt like we needed paramedics on standby.
6049.50s - 6052.58s |  It was a little nerve wracking, but we also did something.
6052.58s - 6054.70s |  It wasn't an official competition,
6054.70s - 6056.50s |  but we decided to push the limits again
6056.50s - 6059.18s |  and Saturday morning following our same structure,
6059.18s - 6062.18s |  we had a completely AI team.
6063.78s - 6064.62s |  That was it.
6064.62s - 6065.46s |  They weren't typing prompts.
6065.46s - 6068.86s |  It was a full AI bot talking to someone
6068.86s - 6070.42s |  and that was incredible.
6070.42s - 6072.98s |  So now we're looking at how do we incorporate the AI piece
6072.98s - 6075.38s |  into our competition for next year?
6075.38s - 6076.86s |  So a lot of research, a lot of thinking,
6076.86s - 6078.26s |  a lot of work for us next year.
6078.26s - 6079.62s |  But without further ado,
6079.62s - 6082.54s |  our second place team was Hall and Ocent
6082.54s - 6085.10s |  and I'm joined on stage with our first place team.
6085.10s - 6086.26s |  I like that name.
6086.26s - 6090.94s |  A girl has a team and that team is comprised of Andy, James
6090.94s - 6095.02s |  and unfortunately their third teammate had to not be present
6095.02s - 6097.38s |  due to an emergency, but Jace.
6097.38s - 6107.16s |  So Andy, James and Jace, our first place team.
6107.16s - 6108.00s |  Awesome.
6108.00s - 6108.92s |  Thank you everyone to help support us.
6108.92s - 6112.36s |  Attendees are Gund, Nikita, Grifter, DT.
6112.36s - 6123.04s |  Thank you so much.
6123.04s - 6124.48s |  Oh, thanks.
6124.48s - 6125.32s |  Presence.
6125.32s - 6126.14s |  Thanks.
6126.14s - 6127.32s |  Bribes.
6127.32s - 6132.32s |  So this next crew put on an incredible competition.
6133.68s - 6135.40s |  I actually heard enough about it that I was like,
6135.40s - 6136.24s |  I got to make it over there.
6136.24s - 6137.72s |  I've got to make it over there
6137.72s - 6140.92s |  from the folks who were participating.
6140.92s - 6144.40s |  The Embedded Systems Village CTF put together
6144.40s - 6145.68s |  an incredible challenge.
6145.68s - 6146.92s |  They had, what did you say?
6146.96s - 6150.36s |  70 different teams that were competing
6150.36s - 6153.00s |  and they had to be gated through different things.
6153.00s - 6154.16s |  I'll let them get into that.
6154.16s - 6158.32s |  I will say though, what really warms my heart
6158.32s - 6160.30s |  is that they handed me something they had made.
6160.30s - 6164.88s |  It was a badge that they stopped and handed it to me
6164.88s - 6167.88s |  and they said, wait a minute, get him the instructions.
6167.88s - 6169.20s |  He'll hurt himself.
6172.00s - 6178.20s |  The Embedded Village Systems CTF.
6178.20s - 6179.20s |  Hey, DEF CON.
6179.20s - 6181.40s |  I'm Tevo from the Embedded Systems Village.
6183.08s - 6186.08s |  I first want to thank all the DEF CON organizers
6186.08s - 6188.82s |  and the village goons, John and Pedro.
6190.00s - 6191.84s |  This year was a lot of work
6191.84s - 6193.02s |  and I really appreciate everything
6193.02s - 6194.12s |  that you were able to help us with
6194.12s - 6196.16s |  and it was a great event.
6196.16s - 6197.50s |  I want to thank the team behind me
6197.50s - 6199.28s |  that helped put on this challenge.
6199.28s - 6201.36s |  It made a really incredible CTF.
6201.36s - 6203.20s |  We had over 50 challenges.
6203.20s - 6205.48s |  It started with some embedded devices
6205.48s - 6208.40s |  that had known vulnerabilities and end-day vulnerabilities
6208.40s - 6211.20s |  from LTE gateways to satellite base stations
6211.20s - 6213.50s |  and ruggedized camera systems.
6213.50s - 6216.32s |  This year, the challenge that we added
6216.32s - 6220.36s |  was that when teams got to a certain threshold,
6220.36s - 6222.56s |  we would give them an embedded development board
6222.56s - 6224.04s |  with challenges baked into that
6224.04s - 6225.24s |  and they would take that home
6225.24s - 6226.34s |  and they worked on them overnight
6226.34s - 6227.48s |  and they would come back the next day
6227.48s - 6230.40s |  and they would get a bunch of points in the CTF.
6230.40s - 6233.48s |  I want to give a big props to the team, BYU Pony,
6233.48s - 6234.92s |  who made a really good push
6235.36s - 6236.88s |  and actually got tied at one point,
6236.88s - 6240.60s |  but ultimately lost out to our winners, Flowers by Irene.
6261.22s - 6262.22s |  We're psychoholics.
6262.22s - 6264.98s |  We don't just win challenges, we run them.
6264.98s - 6267.34s |  We get black badges and we give them away.
6268.60s - 6269.44s |  I don't know.
6269.44s - 6272.34s |  All right, so if you're not familiar with this contest,
6272.34s - 6276.06s |  Crafting Compile is on the contest stage.
6276.06s - 6278.82s |  I'll let them get into all of the actual details
6278.82s - 6279.94s |  about how the contest went,
6279.94s - 6281.86s |  but I will say that one of the things
6281.86s - 6285.46s |  that, see, that's what they told me I would hurt myself with
6285.46s - 6287.78s |  and now DT is just swinging it around.
6290.18s - 6291.14s |  What are you saying?
6291.14s - 6292.10s |  I didn't say anything, man.
6292.10s - 6292.94s |  I'm at school.
6292.94s - 6293.78s |  We're good.
6296.34s - 6297.94s |  One of the parts of their challenge, though,
6297.94s - 6300.34s |  is that they have a team distraction
6300.34s - 6302.70s |  who is meant to distract the competitors
6302.70s - 6305.78s |  throughout the entire contest.
6305.78s - 6307.38s |  Well, at one point,
6307.38s - 6309.96s |  one of the members of team distraction came up to me
6309.96s - 6312.68s |  and said, hey, we need to talk about the sun
6312.68s - 6314.64s |  because it's really, really bright over there
6314.64s - 6316.72s |  and it's like blinding people and stuff.
6316.72s - 6320.50s |  And I was like, you want me to fix the sun?
6321.68s - 6325.76s |  And I was like, aren't you on team distraction?
6325.76s - 6327.48s |  Badge the sun.
6327.48s - 6328.64s |  All right, so.
6328.64s - 6336.03s |  All right, Crafting Compile.
6336.03s - 6340.19s |  I can feel the love, I can feel the love.
6340.19s - 6341.71s |  Hey, everyone.
6341.71s - 6345.01s |  So yeah, this psychoholics team is kind of interesting.
6345.85s - 6347.85s |  So a little background on Crash Compile.
6347.85s - 6350.13s |  It's a programming drinking game.
6350.13s - 6353.69s |  So we had 49 teams register.
6353.69s - 6354.93s |  Nine of them made the cut.
6354.93s - 6356.45s |  And on the main stage,
6356.45s - 6359.25s |  they had to go through a series of programming challenges.
6359.25s - 6361.69s |  In this case, they had to actually write code
6361.69s - 6363.17s |  to navigate a maze
6363.17s - 6366.61s |  and discover all these programming challenges along the way.
6366.61s - 6368.85s |  And anytime they messed up,
6368.85s - 6371.41s |  something didn't work or we just felt like it,
6371.41s - 6372.41s |  they had to drink.
6374.13s - 6375.37s |  For a long time.
6377.25s - 6380.69s |  We went through, I think it was around 145 beers
6380.69s - 6384.25s |  for nine teams in a short amount of time.
6384.25s - 6385.09s |  Very good.
6386.05s - 6389.25s |  The winning team, Hack O' Spaghetti,
6389.25s - 6390.49s |  not only got drunk,
6390.49s - 6393.97s |  but they also win this magnificent dice
6393.97s - 6396.53s |  that we put together, solid steel.
6396.53s - 6398.25s |  Very dangerous.
6398.25s - 6399.45s |  Don't break the laptop.
6399.45s - 6400.53s |  Don't break the laptop.
6400.65s - 6401.49s |  Don't break it to DT.
6401.49s - 6403.73s |  He'll throw it in the office.
6403.73s - 6404.69s |  Just willy nilly.
6406.01s - 6408.61s |  Anyway, we really enjoyed it this year.
6408.61s - 6409.65s |  Things went really well.
6409.65s - 6412.61s |  Wanted to thank all of the contest goons,
6412.61s - 6414.85s |  contest events goons.
6414.85s - 6416.65s |  Everything went off swimmingly.
6416.65s - 6418.45s |  We even made our own sign this year,
6418.45s - 6420.07s |  which was like arts and crafts.
6420.07s - 6421.17s |  I really enjoyed that.
6423.25s - 6424.81s |  But yeah, thank you everyone.
6424.81s - 6429.94s |  Thank you.
6429.94s - 6430.76s |  Thank you.
6430.76s - 6431.60s |  Thank you.
6431.60s - 6432.44s |  Thank you.
6432.44s - 6433.26s |  Thank you.
6433.26s - 6436.53s |  Get out.
6436.53s - 6437.97s |  I actually, just to be clear,
6437.97s - 6439.81s |  I do love the Psychaholics.
6439.81s - 6441.93s |  I play D&D with a couple of them, so.
6443.87s - 6445.05s |  All right.
6445.05s - 6447.03s |  This next crew up here,
6447.03s - 6447.87s |  I always say this,
6447.87s - 6450.45s |  this is a contest that's also near and dear to my heart
6450.45s - 6452.51s |  because I used to run it.
6452.51s - 6454.29s |  And when I did,
6455.33s - 6457.09s |  we did a lot of bad things,
6457.09s - 6459.09s |  but they have taken it,
6459.09s - 6463.33s |  allegedly, we did a lot of bad things.
6463.33s - 6465.25s |  They've taken it to the next level.
6465.25s - 6467.01s |  They've actually integrated it so much
6467.01s - 6468.29s |  into the conference now
6468.29s - 6471.69s |  that it really is part of DEF CON.
6471.69s - 6474.25s |  So, and then at a certain point,
6474.25s - 6477.25s |  there's always been strip teases,
6477.25s - 6478.65s |  but this was the first year
6478.65s - 6480.69s |  that a robot dog was twerking
6480.69s - 6482.11s |  while that was going on.
6483.13s - 6490.39s |  The scavenger hunt.
6490.39s - 6491.23s |  Allegedly.
6491.23s - 6492.07s |  Allegedly.
6492.07s - 6494.27s |  Oh, this, I love this.
6494.27s - 6495.27s |  Did you see?
6495.27s - 6496.83s |  They run over our stickers.
6496.83s - 6497.67s |  Fantastic.
6498.67s - 6500.19s |  Just like that.
6502.19s - 6504.87s |  That is some authentic traction.
6504.87s - 6505.71s |  So as mentioned,
6505.71s - 6507.11s |  we are the DEF CON scavenger hunt.
6507.11s - 6510.95s |  This is our 27th consecutive year here at the con.
6512.03s - 6512.91s |  My name is Zora.
6512.91s - 6515.59s |  This is the 10th year I've been working the scavenger hunt
6515.59s - 6517.23s |  as a judge alongside Sconce,
6517.23s - 6519.11s |  who it's also his 10th year.
6519.11s - 6523.27s |  We have EvilMofo in his 12th year as a judge for the hunt.
6523.27s - 6524.99s |  We have Balsa for his third year.
6524.99s - 6526.19s |  And of course, DualD,
6526.23s - 6528.31s |  who is busy packing up all our shenanigans
6528.31s - 6531.27s |  in his 15th year working the hunt.
6531.27s - 6533.11s |  If you don't know who we are,
6533.11s - 6538.11s |  we are allegedly the cause of all shenanigans at the con.
6538.31s - 6540.31s |  And one of the best ways that you can experience
6540.31s - 6543.35s |  a little bit of everything that DEF CON has to offer.
6543.35s - 6545.71s |  A lot of the past teams and players
6545.71s - 6548.79s |  have become core parts of this community.
6549.75s - 6550.95s |  So with that,
6551.75s - 6556.75s |  we have had a record of 150 teams sign up to play this year.
6559.03s - 6559.87s |  And with that,
6559.87s - 6570.05s |  our top three teams are all first time DEF CON attendees.
6570.05s - 6574.33s |  So we'd like to acknowledge our second and third place teams.
6574.33s - 6577.45s |  Our third place team is Degenerates
6577.45s - 6579.77s |  with a total of 103 points.
6580.77s - 6585.77s |  Our second place team is Regenerate One with 118 points.
6587.21s - 6589.17s |  And of course our first place team,
6589.17s - 6592.09s |  Bananarchy with 143 points.
6592.09s - 6592.93s |  Coming up guys.
6608.73s - 6611.65s |  So with that, thank you so much.
6611.65s - 6612.97s |  Thank you for always having us
6612.97s - 6615.13s |  and allowing us to raise all sorts of help.
6616.09s - 6617.13s |  Second and third place teams,
6617.13s - 6618.69s |  come see us outside to track one
6618.69s - 6630.23s |  and we'll see y'all next year.
6630.23s - 6632.55s |  All right, so we really like contests
6632.55s - 6635.75s |  that try to engage multiple aspects of the community
6635.75s - 6638.87s |  or try to push people to get outside of their comfort zone,
6638.91s - 6640.11s |  learn new skills,
6640.11s - 6641.83s |  engage new attendees
6641.83s - 6645.27s |  and challenge them throughout the conference.
6645.27s - 6647.83s |  This next contest did all of those things
6647.83s - 6649.95s |  and really brought some,
6649.95s - 6653.91s |  tried to focus on bringing new attendees into it
6653.91s - 6656.99s |  and pushing them to really, really experience DEF CON
6656.99s - 6658.79s |  as it was meant to be experienced.
6658.79s - 6667.79s |  And so with that, Octopus Games.
6667.79s - 6669.03s |  What's up guys?
6669.03s - 6672.66s |  Who knows about Octopus Game?
6672.66s - 6674.58s |  If you would have told me three years ago
6674.58s - 6675.66s |  when I came up with the idea
6675.66s - 6677.10s |  that I'd be up here speaking,
6677.10s - 6678.90s |  giving one of our players a black badge,
6678.90s - 6680.54s |  I would have probably laughed at you.
6680.54s - 6685.42s |  But yeah, my original idea was to rip off the show Squid Game
6685.42s - 6686.90s |  and create a battle royale
6686.90s - 6689.62s |  and everyone would meet up and battle with kids games
6689.62s - 6691.74s |  and they would make friends and explore the con
6691.74s - 6693.22s |  and it was awesome.
6693.22s - 6694.86s |  And over the next two years,
6694.86s - 6696.10s |  it's grown and evolved
6696.10s - 6699.62s |  and we have an amazing team of volunteers.
6699.62s - 6703.14s |  Let me, Josh Mason's calling me right now.
6703.14s - 6704.34s |  It's too late.
6704.34s - 6705.18s |  You got to answer it.
6705.18s - 6707.74s |  If you get called on stage, you have to answer.
6707.74s - 6708.58s |  It's too late.
6708.58s - 6710.26s |  I fucked up.
6710.26s - 6711.10s |  They'll call back.
6711.10s - 6714.10s |  Okay, so I did very little to help the people
6714.10s - 6715.74s |  that should be up here are behind me
6715.74s - 6716.58s |  and they're kind of shy,
6716.58s - 6717.50s |  especially this lady.
6717.50s - 6718.50s |  This is my wife, Nicole.
6718.50s - 6719.82s |  She ran the game this year.
6719.82s - 6722.66s |  So really they deserve all the credit.
6722.66s - 6723.86s |  I did very little.
6725.62s - 6728.26s |  So thank you, Nicole, for running the contest
6728.26s - 6730.66s |  and all of our volunteers this year.
6730.66s - 6733.02s |  Wade, who has one of the most famous mustaches
6733.02s - 6734.06s |  in InfoSec.
6735.30s - 6737.94s |  Josh Mason, who was just trying to call me right now
6737.94s - 6739.38s |  and I should have answered it.
6739.38s - 6742.38s |  Jibby, Erica, Jen and George, thank you so much.
6742.38s - 6743.58s |  Thank you to our sponsors,
6743.58s - 6746.34s |  Black Girls Hack, Cyber Supply Drop,
6746.34s - 6747.98s |  Women's Society of Cyber Jiu-Jitsu
6747.98s - 6749.62s |  is really awesome to give our players
6749.62s - 6751.70s |  some really good prizes this year.
6751.70s - 6755.74s |  And thank you to Grifter, Nikita, DT,
6755.74s - 6758.14s |  everyone on the contest and events crew,
6758.14s - 6760.02s |  Cabe's and Seco, everybody.
6760.02s - 6761.26s |  Like this is really awesome.
6761.26s - 6763.86s |  And yeah, we just wanted to build a contest.
6763.86s - 6767.74s |  That's kind of the unofficial tutorial quest for the con.
6767.74s - 6769.46s |  We want people to explore the villages,
6769.46s - 6772.34s |  meet people, like you said, outside of your comfort zone.
6772.34s - 6774.10s |  So yeah, thanks for having us.
6779.30s - 6780.26s |  All right, we're not done yet.
6780.26s - 6781.18s |  Sorry, sorry.
6782.10s - 6783.98s |  Little, little premature.
6783.98s - 6785.98s |  We had 120 competitors.
6785.98s - 6789.02s |  16 of them completed all 12 challenges
6789.02s - 6790.94s |  with the final challenge tiebreaker
6790.94s - 6794.10s |  being a large game of Simon Says.
6794.10s - 6796.62s |  And the winner was Greg.
6796.62s - 6797.46s |  That's all we know.
6797.46s - 6798.30s |  He's not here right now.
6798.30s - 6800.26s |  We do have his information and we'll be giving him the badge.
6800.26s - 6801.46s |  Thank you.
6801.46s - 6802.30s |  Oh, good.
6802.30s - 6803.62s |  Let's save this one badge.
6803.62s - 6804.66s |  Problem solved.
6804.66s - 6805.50s |  Oh, you got it?
6805.50s - 6806.34s |  Okay.
6806.34s - 6807.46s |  So you'll get it to Greg.
6807.46s - 6808.38s |  You'll get the badge.
6808.38s - 6809.22s |  Okay, great.
6809.22s - 6815.79s |  Thank you very much.
6815.79s - 6818.87s |  All right, this next contest really brings it.
6818.87s - 6822.75s |  They bring a huge team to literally build a city
6822.75s - 6827.67s |  inside of the contest area to outfit it with utilities
6827.67s - 6830.43s |  and to put on one hell of a show
6830.43s - 6844.19s |  with that Red Alert ICS CTF.
6844.19s - 6845.19s |  Hi, DEF CON.
6845.19s - 6846.71s |  Annyeonghaseyo from Korea.
6847.59s - 6849.99s |  So we've been running the Red Alert ICS CTF
6849.99s - 6852.23s |  for the past three days.
6852.23s - 6854.31s |  And we hope that our players have had a lot of fun.
6854.31s - 6858.23s |  We've run a pure ICS team CTF, right?
6858.23s - 6861.55s |  And we had 62 teams show up this year
6861.59s - 6863.43s |  and it's been a fun weekend, I hope.
6864.27s - 6867.35s |  For quick results on joint third position,
6867.35s - 6870.15s |  we have three teams, Corridor Crew, Dollar Rip,
6870.15s - 6871.63s |  and Ripper's Cape.
6871.63s - 6873.55s |  Second position, Noob Tube.
6873.55s - 6876.27s |  And first position, Team Tesuji.
6876.27s - 6882.44s |  Black Badge winners.
6882.44s - 6885.48s |  And just a quick note on the amount of work
6885.48s - 6886.32s |  that the team has done.
6886.32s - 6889.08s |  They came in second place last year and they kept working.
6889.08s - 6892.48s |  They came back this year and they just won the CTF.
6892.48s - 6895.24s |  And thank you DEF CON for making us a Black Badge event
6895.60s - 6898.72s |  for the third time and the second time in a row right now.
6898.72s - 6901.80s |  And a special gratitude to our contest leads,
6901.80s - 6904.72s |  contest goons, Sikov, Cabes, Grifter,
6904.72s - 6906.32s |  everyone here on stage.
6906.32s - 6908.64s |  And for the rest of my team on stage and off stage
6908.64s - 6911.08s |  who have come in from Korea and from Singapore.
6911.08s - 6914.72s |  And to our sponsor and partner, Athena Dynamics as well.
6914.72s - 6922.84s |  Thank you very much, everybody.
6928.98s - 6930.86s |  All right, if you were in the contest area,
6930.86s - 6932.94s |  you really couldn't miss this one.
6932.94s - 6937.38s |  The next folks coming to the stage are the Car Hacking CTF.
6937.38s - 6940.06s |  One of the things that I love about this CTF
6940.06s - 6941.98s |  is that they continue to innovate.
6941.98s - 6944.02s |  They continue to switch things up
6944.02s - 6947.32s |  and they actually convince manufacturers
6947.32s - 6950.18s |  to allow them to add aspects of the contest
6950.18s - 6952.70s |  into what they're doing with the vehicle.
6952.70s - 6957.70s |  So, like I said, the contest creators that are here
6958.02s - 6960.22s |  really make DEF CON what it is.
6960.22s - 6962.02s |  They put in a significant amount of work
6962.02s - 6964.46s |  and they even in cases jump through
6964.46s - 6968.54s |  what must only be the most ridiculous legal hoops
6968.54s - 6969.74s |  to make these things happen.
6969.74s - 6971.54s |  So, the Car Hacking CTF.
6976.33s - 6977.27s |  Thank you, Grifter.
6978.21s - 6979.05s |  I'm gonna be quick,
6979.05s - 6981.57s |  cause I wanna relax and go get in a hot tub.
6981.57s - 6982.61s |  I'm Justin Justin.
6982.61s - 6985.13s |  I'm the chief of the Car Hacking Village.
6985.13s - 6986.63s |  This has been our 10 year anniversary.
6986.63s - 6989.83s |  So, thank you DEF CON for letting us do this for 10 years.
6989.83s - 6991.73s |  Cannot believe it's been 10 years now.
6993.17s - 6994.53s |  Some firsts this year.
6994.53s - 6996.21s |  We brought a semi-truck this year.
6996.21s - 6997.21s |  I don't know if anybody's seen,
6997.21s - 6999.53s |  but we've been trying to do this for a few years now.
6999.53s - 7000.45s |  We actually made it happen.
7000.45s - 7001.93s |  So, we had a class eight semi-truck here
7001.93s - 7004.45s |  that people were able to learn and hack on.
7004.45s - 7006.57s |  And like Grifter was saying, another first for us,
7006.57s - 7010.81s |  we had an OEM Rivian actually put flags in their vehicle
7010.81s - 7013.95s |  for people to hack on and try to figure out and find.
7013.95s - 7015.21s |  So, that was really big for us
7015.21s - 7017.41s |  and amazing that an OEM actually worked with us
7017.41s - 7018.67s |  to put flags in their vehicle.
7018.67s - 7020.29s |  So, huge shout out to Rivian.
7020.29s - 7023.83s |  Thank you.
7023.83s - 7026.11s |  Moving into our CTF challenge.
7026.67s - 7027.79s |  We had about 15 challenges.
7027.79s - 7031.99s |  We tried to keep them very hard and difficult.
7031.99s - 7035.11s |  They were all around automotive networking and exploitation.
7035.11s - 7037.15s |  We had 95 teams registered this year.
7037.15s - 7039.63s |  So, a big shout out to all the teams that played.
7040.59s - 7041.79s |  Our last problem was solved
7041.79s - 7044.23s |  about an hour before the contest closed.
7044.23s - 7046.39s |  And to dig into some of our winners this year,
7046.39s - 7049.55s |  I'll just start with our second place team was Canucks.
7049.55s - 7052.03s |  So, congratulations.
7052.03s - 7054.35s |  And moving into our first place team,
7054.35s - 7057.11s |  who actually also won a Tesla.
7057.11s - 7059.15s |  So, we actually gave away a car this year
7059.15s - 7060.67s |  for our first place prize.
7060.67s - 7061.99s |  It wasn't just, well,
7061.99s - 7063.47s |  we found out about a black badge later,
7063.47s - 7066.11s |  but we're not only just allowing the winners
7066.11s - 7067.11s |  to get a black badge this year,
7067.11s - 7068.87s |  they are also winning a Tesla.
7068.87s - 7071.19s |  So, congratulations to our first place team.
7071.19s - 7072.47s |  Upper score.
7072.47s - 7078.27s |  Congratulations and thank you guys again.
7078.27s - 7079.11s |  Thanks Defcon.
7089.76s - 7091.00s |  All right.
7091.00s - 7093.68s |  You know them and you love them.
7093.68s - 7095.24s |  They knew, they were the only ones
7095.60s - 7097.08s |  who knew they were getting a black badge
7097.08s - 7098.00s |  before this morning.
7098.00s - 7101.20s |  And that's because I texted Jeff yesterday
7101.20s - 7102.96s |  as Hacker Jeopardy was starting.
7102.96s - 7105.80s |  I said, hey, it's the 30th anniversary.
7105.80s - 7107.24s |  We're doing this, right?
7107.24s - 7111.16s |  And he just sent back, yes, with exclamation points.
7111.16s - 7116.16s |  So, what they don't know is like Jeff and I had talked
7116.32s - 7118.56s |  and I said, hey, one of the guys on the team
7118.56s - 7122.52s |  for Hacker Jeopardy already has a black badge.
7122.52s - 7124.56s |  And he was like, so there's just two guys
7125.00s - 7125.84s |  that don't have black badges
7125.84s - 7128.44s |  on the 30th anniversary winning team.
7128.44s - 7130.60s |  We should give them two black badges.
7131.56s - 7146.04s |  So, come up and get those two black badges, Hacker Jeopardy.
7146.04s - 7149.44s |  30 fucking years of Hacker Jeopardy, Jeff.
7150.80s - 7154.92s |  Not many of you know that when we did Hacker Jeopardy one,
7154.92s - 7157.74s |  Jeff was my van of vinyl.
7160.04s - 7163.60s |  There are pictures, we will make sure that they are up.
7163.60s - 7167.60s |  And Nikita has somehow tolerated our bullshit
7167.60s - 7169.64s |  for how many years now?
7169.64s - 7173.12s |  Grifter and DT, the support that we've had.
7173.12s - 7178.12s |  And you guys, you've made this 30 years absolutely amazing.
7179.72s - 7183.16s |  And as long as I fucking stay vertical,
7183.16s - 7185.56s |  you can't get rid of me.
7185.56s - 7188.16s |  We will return, Hacker Jeopardy.
7188.16s - 7190.92s |  30 fucking years, thank you all.
7191.20s - 7196.20s |  This year, it came down at the very end.
7196.64s - 7200.00s |  We had three teams for the final.
7200.00s - 7202.20s |  And everybody could have won.
7202.20s - 7204.40s |  Everybody could have won.
7204.40s - 7207.92s |  And the final category was to do some sort of bullshit,
7207.92s - 7212.40s |  figuring out what all the OSI layers were
7212.40s - 7214.20s |  in reverse alphabetical order.
7214.20s - 7218.20s |  So one of the teams got it absolutely right,
7218.20s - 7220.62s |  not in the form of a question.
7221.12s - 7226.12s |  Another team got it absolutely right,
7227.56s - 7230.30s |  but not in reverse order.
7232.12s - 7235.28s |  So the only team that got it right is,
7235.28s - 7239.32s |  my other computer is your stepmom.
7239.32s - 7240.64s |  Let's hear it for them.
7254.11s - 7255.31s |  Congratulations, guys.
7258.47s - 7259.63s |  Make it weird for them.
7260.67s - 7267.08s |  All right, and last but certainly not least,
7267.60s - 7271.32s |  I say this every year, they need no introduction,
7271.32s - 7272.32s |  capture the flag.
7281.69s - 7283.57s |  Good afternoon, DEF CON.
7283.57s - 7285.37s |  We are Nautilus Institute,
7285.37s - 7288.25s |  third time organizers of DEF CON Capture the Flag.
7288.25s - 7291.61s |  And I assure you, there are actually more than three of us.
7291.61s - 7295.13s |  So kicking things off, once again,
7295.13s - 7297.09s |  we partnered with LiveCTF
7297.09s - 7301.85s |  to bring more audience enjoyable activities into our game.
7301.85s - 7305.63s |  LiveCTF is the head-to-head speed hacking component
7305.63s - 7307.45s |  of DEF CON Capture the Flag,
7307.45s - 7310.01s |  where participants must battle head-to-head
7310.01s - 7311.27s |  in a tournament for points
7311.27s - 7313.89s |  that are added to their final score.
7313.89s - 7318.37s |  You can see the full recaps online at livectf.com
7318.37s - 7322.83s |  or scan this QR code, pretend,
7322.83s - 7325.29s |  to go right to the final match.
7325.29s - 7327.89s |  All challenges are already open source
7327.89s - 7330.61s |  and linked from that site as well.
7330.61s - 7333.37s |  Our favorite moment was in one of the first rounds
7333.37s - 7336.69s |  where last year's winning team, Maple Mallard Magistrates,
7336.69s - 7339.97s |  were knocked right down into the spirit world lower bracket
7339.97s - 7342.39s |  due to an unintended solution.
7342.39s - 7346.41s |  Always watch your stir and comps versus mem comps.
7346.41s - 7348.67s |  Congratulations to Blue Water
7348.67s - 7359.11s |  for an undefeated run through LiveCTF.
7359.11s - 7361.07s |  All right, you know we've got to say thanks
7361.07s - 7363.31s |  to a bunch of people who made this possible.
7363.31s - 7366.07s |  So thanks to all the hardworking DEF CON goons
7366.07s - 7369.19s |  in every department, Dark Tangent, Nikita, Grifter,
7369.19s - 7372.47s |  Caves, Seacove, Aster, the rest of the DEF CON staff,
7372.47s - 7374.25s |  especially the knock and sock goons
7374.25s - 7376.91s |  who were extremely helpful with our
7378.75s - 7381.63s |  sometimes very quick needs.
7381.63s - 7384.41s |  Your work, dedication and creativity and ingenuity
7384.41s - 7387.81s |  inspire us to continue to make a mountain worth climbing.
7387.81s - 7389.51s |  This year's finals hosted teams
7389.55s - 7391.95s |  that qualified from many contests.
7391.95s - 7395.95s |  DEF CON CTF finals in 2023, HITCON in Taiwan,
7395.95s - 7399.03s |  Plaid CTF in the US, OCTF in China,
7399.03s - 7402.53s |  and our own qualifiers hosted this May.
7402.53s - 7406.75s |  Our qualifiers saw 1,700 teams submit hundreds of solutions
7406.75s - 7408.79s |  to dozens of challenges.
7408.79s - 7412.51s |  For finals, 12 teams flew in from dozens of countries
7412.51s - 7417.37s |  to the largest DEF CON CTF venue yet.
7417.37s - 7420.33s |  We built eight attack-defense challenges,
7420.33s - 7422.09s |  one King of the Hill challenge,
7422.09s - 7423.61s |  and our friend from Live CTF
7423.61s - 7426.65s |  ran 22 head-to-head Live CTF matches.
7426.65s - 7428.91s |  The scoreboard was busy the whole time,
7428.91s - 7430.61s |  and first place was up for grabs
7430.61s - 7434.68s |  up until the last hour of the game.
7434.68s - 7437.46s |  In third place this year, we had Super Dice Code.
7440.84s - 7444.64s |  There we go.
7444.64s - 7447.64s |  In second place, and the winners of the Live CTF,
7447.64s - 7454.33s |  we had Blue Water.
7454.33s - 7456.97s |  And in first place, some of the only people in the world
7456.97s - 7460.01s |  who have been on this stage more than I have for CTF,
7460.01s - 7479.83s |  Maple Mallard Magistrates.
7479.83s - 7481.07s |  Good afternoon, everyone.
7482.15s - 7487.15s |  We're thrilled and honored to be the DEF CON 32 CTF winners.
7487.19s - 7490.79s |  It's a privilege to represent MMM,
7490.79s - 7494.75s |  our amazing international team with PPP from the US,
7494.75s - 7498.95s |  Daduk from Korea, and Maple Bacon from Canada.
7498.95s - 7502.11s |  Winning three years in a row
7502.11s - 7505.63s |  really shows the dedication, brainpower we have,
7505.63s - 7507.91s |  and teamwork we've got.
7507.91s - 7511.87s |  The past few days were intense and challenging,
7511.87s - 7514.91s |  but that's what pushed us to our best.
7514.91s - 7516.79s |  And of course, a huge thank you
7516.79s - 7518.87s |  to the organizers and DEF CON
7518.87s - 7522.75s |  for crafting such a dynamic and engaging competition.
7522.75s - 7525.19s |  And to my two teammates,
7525.19s - 7528.11s |  your hard work, skill, and passion
7528.11s - 7531.55s |  are the reasons we're standing here today
7531.55s - 7533.55s |  as champions once again.
7534.39s - 7535.35s |  Thank you, everyone.
7535.35s - 7537.75s |  We can't wait to see you all again next year.
7537.75s - 7550.40s |  Thanks.
7550.40s - 7551.24s |  All right.
7551.24s - 7554.24s |  So this is where I would like to thank
7554.24s - 7555.52s |  all of our departments
7555.52s - 7558.52s |  that have made this conference possible.
7558.52s - 7560.76s |  And I'd also like to point out,
7560.76s - 7564.04s |  none of us were ready to change locations
7564.04s - 7565.88s |  so quickly six months ago.
7566.88s - 7568.84s |  I haven't really told the story, but...
7569.44s - 7572.72s |  So we'd had this really long-standing relationship
7572.72s - 7573.76s |  with Caesars,
7573.76s - 7577.12s |  and the main person that I would work with,
7577.12s - 7578.60s |  I wouldn't talk to very often
7578.60s - 7580.44s |  because things would be going right.
7581.36s - 7583.80s |  And almost 20 years.
7583.80s - 7586.36s |  And I get a call, I get a message,
7586.36s - 7590.08s |  and like, hey, are you available for a call sometime?
7590.08s - 7593.04s |  And I'm thinking, oh, I don't hear from him very often.
7593.04s - 7594.72s |  I wonder what's going on.
7594.72s - 7596.36s |  So I ask our salespeople,
7596.52s - 7599.32s |  Caesars sales, like, should I get ready for this call?
7599.32s - 7602.12s |  They're like, we don't know what the call's about.
7602.12s - 7603.16s |  I go, okay.
7603.16s - 7604.00s |  Oh, 20 years.
7604.00s - 7605.64s |  I bet he's retiring.
7605.64s - 7606.64s |  He's gotta be retiring.
7606.64s - 7608.24s |  He's gonna give me a heads up he's retiring
7608.24s - 7610.32s |  and he's gonna pass me off to the next guy.
7610.32s - 7611.60s |  Okay, cool.
7611.60s - 7613.96s |  So I get on the phone call and we're chit-chatting
7613.96s - 7616.92s |  and I'm waiting for him to tell me that he's retiring.
7616.92s - 7618.40s |  And he's like, I've got some bad news.
7618.40s - 7620.04s |  We're terminating the contract.
7621.28s - 7622.88s |  Oh, so you're not gonna be able to do it?
7622.88s - 7625.88s |  And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
7625.92s - 7627.36s |  Oh, so you're not retiring.
7629.00s - 7631.12s |  This is gonna be a problem.
7631.12s - 7633.76s |  And yeah, that was quite the moment.
7633.76s - 7637.48s |  And that's when it just all happened all at once.
7637.48s - 7642.48s |  And so I said, what the fuck do I do now?
7642.92s - 7646.36s |  And he said, oh, remember Janice used to work for us?
7646.36s - 7648.08s |  Yeah, she's over at the LVCC now.
7648.08s - 7649.76s |  We've got a date lined up for you.
7649.76s - 7651.12s |  They're holding the space.
7651.12s - 7652.84s |  Give them a call.
7652.84s - 7654.28s |  Super awesome.
7654.28s - 7657.68s |  And so it worked out and here we are,
7657.68s - 7660.12s |  which meant that everybody on this list,
7660.12s - 7663.76s |  all the teams, departments, contests, creators, villages,
7663.76s - 7667.40s |  we all had to pivot at warp speed
7667.40s - 7669.36s |  to make this conference happen,
7669.36s - 7671.56s |  which I'll be honest at many times
7671.56s - 7673.22s |  did not quite look possible.
7674.08s - 7675.96s |  But I think what's happened
7676.92s - 7678.40s |  is I think we've all just gone through
7678.40s - 7682.56s |  this giant trial by fire experience, right?
7682.56s - 7685.16s |  It was really kind of a little traumatic,
7685.16s - 7686.72s |  but we pulled it off.
7686.72s - 7690.12s |  And I think because the event was so positive
7690.12s - 7694.36s |  and the space so good, we had a great experience.
7694.36s - 7696.36s |  Who likes this space?
7696.36s - 7704.08s |  It was not something we would have done on our own.
7707.14s - 7708.20s |  We wouldn't have just decided
7708.20s - 7709.66s |  to make this kind of a big change,
7709.66s - 7711.88s |  but since we were forced to make the change,
7711.88s - 7713.90s |  we made the best of it.
7713.90s - 7717.26s |  So I just want to thank all the departments
7717.26s - 7719.06s |  and all the goons that made it possible.
7719.06s - 7720.82s |  Let's give you guys a round of applause.
7720.82s - 7730.22s |  Thank you.
7730.22s - 7733.22s |  And I'd like to acknowledge and recognize
7733.22s - 7735.30s |  the goons that are retiring.
7735.30s - 7739.22s |  Gmark, Noise, Ira, Estabang, Gattaca, Dekuna,
7739.22s - 7744.22s |  The Saint, Morphix, Brick, or Bick, Wham, Casper,
7747.14s - 7750.74s |  and all the current gold badge holders and all.
7750.74s - 7753.42s |  So a gold badge holder is sort of like an Uber badge.
7753.42s - 7757.62s |  After 10 years of service, if you decide to retire,
7757.62s - 7760.36s |  you get attendance for life for the service.
7761.34s - 7764.38s |  And then Noons, which are the new goons coming in.
7764.38s - 7765.82s |  So thank you, everyone.
7765.82s - 7773.53s |  Noons!
7773.53s - 7775.25s |  So this is us, so I'll skip by that.
7775.25s - 7777.33s |  Thank you, thank me, thank you.
7777.33s - 7778.17s |  Okay.
7780.21s - 7784.31s |  Also, we try to keep a lot of the content online year round.
7785.15s - 7787.91s |  We have a bunch of social stuff that we try to do.
7787.91s - 7791.27s |  Darrington does a movie night on our Discord.
7791.27s - 7794.31s |  We have our DEF CON social server.
7794.31s - 7797.53s |  We've got stuff on YouTube, Instagram, all that stuff.
7797.53s - 7799.91s |  There's ways to participate with the community year round,
7799.91s - 7803.03s |  or even if you don't get to attend in person.
7804.67s - 7808.15s |  So I have, I think I'm almost out of slides,
7808.15s - 7812.35s |  but I do have something here, dark chocolate story.
7812.35s - 7815.51s |  Okay, so I have to tell you the dark chocolate story.
7815.51s - 7817.55s |  In the badge, at some point,
7817.55s - 7819.63s |  you can elusively sometimes come across
7819.63s - 7820.77s |  the dark tangent character.
7820.77s - 7823.57s |  I guess I'm pretty elusive and I run away from you a lot.
7824.79s - 7828.27s |  But apparently, and no one told me, Mar,
7828.27s - 7832.91s |  that if you get near me and the bright stars align
7832.91s - 7834.79s |  and there's some proximity something,
7834.79s - 7837.99s |  it says that the dark tangent will give you dark chocolate.
7838.19s - 7842.43s |  Or the dark chocolate character arrives.
7842.43s - 7843.59s |  I don't know what it is.
7843.59s - 7845.61s |  So the first time it happens to me,
7845.61s - 7847.43s |  I'm walking down the hall and someone runs up to me
7847.43s - 7851.20s |  and says, dark chocolate.
7851.20s - 7854.08s |  I'm like, okay, what's going on?
7854.08s - 7856.32s |  I had no idea, I was totally bewildered.
7856.32s - 7858.76s |  The second time it happens though,
7858.76s - 7861.76s |  it's last night, it looks like maybe a husband and wife
7861.76s - 7864.88s |  or boyfriend, girlfriend, and they are like,
7864.88s - 7867.36s |  we've got him, we found him, dark chocolate.
7867.36s - 7870.28s |  And they come up to me and they're, dark chocolate.
7871.92s - 7874.96s |  What do we, like if I'm near you, I get a,
7874.96s - 7877.86s |  and I just so happen to have a chocolate bar in my pocket.
7877.86s - 7883.71s |  And so, there they are.
7883.71s - 7885.85s |  There they are, right there.
7892.88s - 7894.22s |  There they are.
7894.22s - 7895.90s |  And I'm thinking to myself, holy shit,
7895.90s - 7897.66s |  I've got chocolate in my pocket.
7897.66s - 7900.10s |  And so I'm, they're like, so dark chocolate,
7900.10s - 7903.06s |  and I just unzip my pocket, I hand them the chocolate bar
7903.06s - 7904.46s |  and I turn around and walk away.
7904.46s - 7909.46s |  And they're like, holy fuck, that worked.
7912.10s - 7913.58s |  It was amazing, and here you are.
7913.58s - 7916.02s |  I just, I knew that it was probably a story
7916.02s - 7918.30s |  you're gonna tell forever because it was like perfect,
7918.30s - 7920.42s |  everything aligned, so that was awesome.
7921.48s - 7922.78s |  And there they, I'm glad I told the story,
7922.78s - 7924.98s |  I'm glad I wrote that down, awesome.
7924.98s - 7928.66s |  Okay, so for next year, we expect to see you back
7928.66s - 7930.36s |  August 7th to 10th.
7937.24s - 7941.32s |  I think this space is amazing, and it gives us a,
7941.32s - 7943.28s |  so some of the comments I heard was,
7943.28s - 7947.28s |  my shoulders aren't bruised from being bumped into.
7947.28s - 7950.94s |  Other people said that it felt like a con from 10 years ago,
7950.94s - 7953.08s |  even though there might be a lot of people here,
7953.08s - 7956.24s |  they didn't feel so much like FOMO and pressure,
7956.24s - 7958.68s |  and it was much more chill and relaxed.
7958.68s - 7961.16s |  Is that a pretty honest estimation, you think?
7961.16s - 7962.06s |  Yeah, pretty cool?
7964.12s - 7966.72s |  I know there's always gonna be growing pains, but it,
7967.72s - 7972.20s |  so as organizers, we're really close to the problem,
7972.20s - 7974.56s |  and sometimes you don't see the big picture,
7974.56s - 7976.66s |  and so for me, I was really obsessing
7976.66s - 7980.80s |  over all the problems, and all I was reading online
7980.80s - 7984.40s |  was people saying, amazing, everybody under one roof,
7984.40s - 7987.36s |  this'll be great, we haven't done this since DEF CON 20,
7987.36s - 7988.28s |  yeah, 27.
7988.44s - 7989.28s |  Yeah.
7991.28s - 7995.16s |  And so, that's when I realized the power
7995.16s - 7996.88s |  of sort of community all under one roof
7996.88s - 7999.60s |  was gonna just wash over all these problems,
7999.60s - 8002.32s |  and that was really, I mean, that was one of the reasons
8002.32s - 8004.68s |  why we really put the energy in to make this happen,
8004.68s - 8007.46s |  was because we thought the benefits of all under one roof
8007.46s - 8009.36s |  was gonna be amazing, and it really,
8009.36s - 8012.56s |  holy, who, what, who's that by the door there?
8012.56s - 8013.40s |  Hey there.
8014.48s - 8015.84s |  Hey, giant chickens.
8016.40s - 8018.96s |  Oh, Jesus Christ.
8024.68s - 8029.44s |  All right, see you next year at the LVCC West Hall.
8029.44s - 8031.20s |  More content will be online,
8031.20s - 8035.24s |  and you are now authorized to disengage.
