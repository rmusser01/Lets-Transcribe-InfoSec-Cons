**Introduction to Warflying**
- Warflying combines wardriving and flying
- Explores the safety, legality, and feasibility of detecting WiFi from an airplane
- Utilizes a Cessna 182 for data collection

**Presenters**
- **Sean McKeever**: Senior security researcher from Metro Detroit
- **Matt Thomassen**: Security professional, commercial multi-engine pilot, licensed airframe and power plant mechanic

**Concept and Motivation**
- **Line of sight**: Advantage in detecting radio frequencies from the air
- Curiosity about the extent of WiFi visibility from an airplane
- Exploration of aircraft and RF interactions

**Safety and Regulations**
- **Safety**: Primary responsibility is to fly the airplane safely; distractions can be fatal
- **Regulations**: FAA guidelines on portable electronic devices and aircraft operation
- **FCC perspective**: Phones should be in airplane mode during flights to avoid interference

**Technical Details**
- **Aircraft used**: Cessna 182 with high wing for better ground visibility
- **Flight parameters**: Cruising speed and altitude considerations for optimal data collection
- **Data collection equipment**: Use of Wiggle app and linSSID on phones and laptops

**Data Collection and Analysis**
- **Test flights**: Conducted multiple flights with varying altitudes and methods
- **Data formats**: Wiggle outputs in KML and CSV formats; includes altitude data
- **Distance analysis**: Attempts to measure the range of detected WiFi signals

**Challenges and Observations**
- **Distractions**: Importance of maintaining focus on flying rather than data collection
- **Legal and airspace constraints**: Need to navigate within permissible airspace
- **Privacy concerns**: Warflying is not stealthy due to aircraft visibility

**Results and Findings**
- **Access points detected**: Thousands of unique BSS IDs collected during flights
- **Distance capabilities**: Signals detected from several kilometers away
- **Comparison with wardriving**: Warflying collects data faster but less comprehensively than wardriving

**Future Exploration**
- **Further investigation**: Exploring different speeds, altitudes, and aircraft types
- **Hardware considerations**: Potential use of drones and different antenna setups

**Conclusion and Acknowledgments**
- Gratitude towards aviation authorities and community for support
- Encouragement for responsible and safe exploration of warflying techniques
