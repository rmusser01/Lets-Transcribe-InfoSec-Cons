 Okay guys, we'd like to welcome you and thank you guys for showing up. Hopefully everybody's
3.92s - 8.72s |  having a really great DEF CON. A lot of great talks out there. We're hoping that ours is at
8.72s - 13.52s |  least mediocre for you guys. We're going to be discussing 10 years in bug bounties
14.24s - 19.68s |  and what we've learned, how we've learned from my perspective as a triage and the enemy,
19.68s - 24.80s |  so to speak. If anybody has submitted stuff, who all has submitted stuff to bug bounties?
24.80s - 34.72s |  Okay, so yeah, I'll be the bad guy today. Nick's here. He is one of the top hackers.
34.72s - 38.24s |  He'll introduce himself and his credentials also. And he's going to be speaking from the
38.24s - 42.64s |  researcher side that said, I'm also a researcher. So we're going to be kind of having a discussion
42.64s - 48.64s |  as to how can you have the best experience as a bug bounty hunter and have the best chance
48.64s - 52.80s |  of success and what does success look like. So that's going to be what we're going through
52.88s - 55.04s |  with this talk. So hopefully you guys get something out of it.
57.09s - 60.85s |  So how many of you are full-time bug bounty hunter here?
62.61s - 63.09s |  Just one.
66.29s - 74.69s |  So we kind of doing this talk because I've been into bug bounty since a decade. So
75.49s - 82.61s |  I'm just trying to explain all the experiences and how a bug bounty can be a full-time carrier
82.61s - 89.65s |  for you as well. So it's kind of a daytime job as well and night time too.
90.69s - 102.45s |  So I've been doing a lot of bug bounties on SYNAC platform and I recently been awarded as
102.45s - 110.93s |  SYNAC Red Team Legend. I'm also a founder of B-Sides Ahmedabad. It's the biggest conference
110.93s - 118.85s |  in India and I also have been advisor to an ACM product. So Charlie.
119.73s - 126.69s |  Guys, generally I'd like to say hi. I have a really unusual background. A lot of people in
126.69s - 130.85s |  the security space do. A lot of us are not just coming straight out of school as bug bounty
130.85s - 137.17s |  hunters, as Red Team. I spent over two decades in customer service and dealing with as an
137.17s - 142.45s |  international translator and international manager for an airline. Then decided I love
142.45s - 148.37s |  technology. It's always been a passion of mine. I was the guy who built Napster servers. I got my
148.37s - 154.85s |  MCSE for amusement one time. So I was that guy who grew up with these old systems and
154.85s - 158.77s |  just loved it enough that then I started really studying coming back into the field
158.77s - 164.13s |  and was really, really blessed to have an opportunity to come in as a triager
164.13s - 172.05s |  and in SYNAC's vulnerability operations team. I have also helped go over 2,400 different
172.05s - 178.29s |  assessments and have probably, I think last poll was somewhere around 40,000 individual reports.
178.85s - 182.93s |  So I've seen quite a few things. I've talked to some people who I have actually triaged their
182.93s - 190.29s |  reports. So a few of them in the audience. I have headed developments on some products around
190.29s - 198.21s |  OWASP, NIST, OSINT, API, headless API, and most recently some AI testing. So a lot of
198.21s - 204.77s |  breadth on our testing and how we go about these things. So I'll walk you through my journey,
204.77s - 217.33s |  how I started and how I continue my full-time bug bounty hunting stuff. And what are my experiences
217.33s - 229.73s |  and what are my failures, how I keep on continuing and finding bugs and earning from it.
229.73s - 238.69s |  So I started in 2013. So I wasn't aware about bug bounties at that time because there is
238.69s - 249.01s |  not much exposure of bug bounties at that time. Only Google and PayPal was running bug bounty
249.01s - 261.89s |  programs at that time. And it's not that much visible to anybody like a non-bug bounty person.
261.97s - 273.41s |  And so I dropped out from college because I do not like much of I do not have much interest in
273.41s - 283.25s |  their knowledge and stuff like that. So I dropped in 2012 and I started looking for the job. So
283.73s - 293.89s |  I accidentally joined an ethical hacking training company. And I usually go out of money
294.77s - 306.45s |  like in less than a month. And I had no idea about bug bounties and stuff. And so one day,
306.45s - 316.69s |  one of my co-workers, he was sitting on a computer and he was submitting some accesses to
316.69s - 326.53s |  PayPal. And after a few days, he got some bounty from the PayPal. So he posted an image on Facebook.
326.53s - 334.13s |  So Facebook was quite a used application at that time. So he posted a photo on Facebook. And
334.13s - 342.45s |  after a few days, I have seen that photo. And next day, I went to the office and asked him
343.09s - 352.85s |  what exactly is this. So he described me that some companies pay bounties if you submit some
352.85s - 363.17s |  vulnerabilities to them. So then from there, I got introduced to bug bounties. And since then,
365.09s - 371.97s |  I started doing a lot of research on what other companies are there too, which is running the
371.97s - 380.21s |  independent programs. And I only get like two companies, just Google and PayPal during that
380.21s - 387.41s |  time. And no other companies was running an independent program. So there was no, there was
387.57s - 395.49s |  So there was no, there was, right now there, there is a lot of bug bounty platforms,
397.33s - 407.17s |  that are running a lot of programs over them, but there was not much exposure of bug bounty
407.17s - 413.81s |  platforms during that time, but more of independent programs running on,
414.53s - 421.09s |  running their bug bounty themselves. I think it was an interesting point you made there is that
421.09s - 428.61s |  the bug bounty space is very much a show me thing. You can be the guy who is a doctorate,
428.61s - 433.65s |  sorted up, has every cert out there, you've run SANS, you've been the SANS instructor.
434.45s - 438.85s |  But if you can't put rubber on the road, the guy who doesn't even have a high school degree is
438.85s - 444.53s |  going to beat you. This is a very egalitarian space. I can say on our end as a triage team,
444.53s - 448.21s |  we don't look at that. I don't care what your certs are. I care what you found.
449.01s - 453.49s |  So this is a space that all that stuff is a matter of your skillset and what you do.
454.05s - 458.37s |  And so I think there's a really good thought there is that none of that matters. And this is
458.37s - 461.97s |  a chance for you guys to start working and get some of the best in the world at biting Google
461.97s - 466.45s |  engineers and seeing if you're smarter. The good news is they have to be right 100%. We only have
466.45s - 477.82s |  to be right once. So when I was searching for Google bug bounties, I came across a lot of
477.82s - 486.30s |  blogs. And there was one blog and this guy, this guy is a good friend of mine now. But at that
486.30s - 495.98s |  time, it was unknown. But he just went to some Google application and he writes some
499.02s - 505.10s |  simple access payload and the payload got triggered. So he got a bounty out of it. So
505.10s - 515.90s |  I was like, he got a very simple bug from the Google and got a bounty out of it. So
515.90s - 524.22s |  I got really motivated out of it. So I thought, let's try these things on other Google products
524.22s - 535.02s |  as well. But I later realized that this stuff looks simple, but you have to dig a lot deeper
535.02s - 543.26s |  and you have to know about Google products and services to actually get these issues.
543.26s - 551.98s |  But these are, I mean, these are just old stuff. You can't find them nowadays. Only if you are
551.98s - 565.50s |  lucky. So I thought of give it a try to Google bug bounty first. So I was, during that time, I was
565.50s - 573.34s |  no idea about the bug, just submitting a simple random stuff without any logic. And I was simply
573.34s - 588.54s |  getting either rejected, no impact, duplicates, or hall of fame only. So I reported like whole year
588.54s - 593.66s |  to Google and I just got duplicates or rejected reports.
595.02s - 600.14s |  So one of the interesting things on this is that when we're out hunting, and I'm just as guilty of
600.14s - 605.10s |  it as anybody else, you see something, you get excited. Let me ask this, how many blue teamers
605.10s - 611.90s |  do we have and developers on the back end that are in the room? Few of you guys, right? As a
611.90s - 616.30s |  researcher, it's really easy to sit and say, oh my gosh, I just found this and go, it's not a
616.30s - 620.06s |  duplicate, it's another path. But you got to ask yourself, is that the same code on the back end?
620.06s - 625.58s |  Because Amazon doesn't code each product separately, guys. We know that. So it's the same things. We've
625.58s - 628.94s |  got to kind of ask ourselves as a researcher, wait a minute, is this really a duplicate? Is the same
628.94s - 633.58s |  code on the back end? You've got to get a little critical. You've also got to think, and he'd said
633.58s - 639.66s |  about impact. The problem with this is, let me ask this, if you're looking at, say, an HSTS flag
639.66s - 645.98s |  missing, what's the malicious use case? What are you going to do with it? Probably nothing.
645.98s - 651.50s |  If you can do something, show me. And so very much when you talk to a triage, show me the
651.50s - 655.66s |  malicious use case. If you've got a cross-site scripting, but it's unauthenticated, what are
655.66s - 661.10s |  you going to really do with that? Show me that you can pop a document.cookie, document.domain,
661.10s - 666.54s |  and then explain to me, yeah, that way I can get their credentials out. I would just have to send
666.54s - 671.66s |  that to my server. That way I can clearly see the malicious use. Make sure you show that impact. I
671.66s - 678.06s |  would say 80% of our rejections are probably because of low impact, and that it's just you
678.06s - 682.46s |  haven't proven what that malicious use case is, that now I need to go to my client and tell them,
682.46s - 687.18s |  I need you to spend engineering time, not only money on this bounty, but now I need you to spend
687.18s - 692.62s |  cycles off your engineering to fix this. And that's my business use case I need to make as a
692.62s - 698.06s |  triage, or isn't this worth fixing? So whenever you're looking at these things, we can't just
698.06s - 704.30s |  look at it as a pure security thing. As security practitioners, we want every last I dotted and
704.30s - 709.10s |  D crossed and perfection, but some of these things are just acceptable risk, and we have to think
709.10s - 714.06s |  about it and go, is it really okay? It might be. Unfortunately, we've had to look at it and say
714.06s - 720.46s |  Google API keys are very similar to this process. The fix is extremely expensive. Google has said
720.46s - 724.06s |  it's not something that they're particularly interested in, and nobody's done it. It's going
724.06s - 730.30s |  to cost them a lot of money to fix it when the risk is pretty minimal. So we have to kind of
730.30s - 734.94s |  consider those things as security practitioners and just not say we have to fix everything.
735.58s - 740.62s |  Let's fix the important things. And so when we're looking at a report, I always have to ask myself,
740.62s - 744.78s |  and I'm as guilty as anybody when I'm doing my own reports, is getting excited about the flaw.
745.74s - 751.18s |  I have to come back and go, is this really a risk? What's my impact? And so a lot of what
751.18s - 757.02s |  Nick was saying here at the beginning is duplicate, no impact. And those are what
757.02s - 762.30s |  people run into all the time is beginning balloting others. I know a couple of people
762.30s - 766.94s |  in this room that have had the same experience as me. Somebody new will come in. They'll get
766.94s - 770.54s |  excited. They're going to submit a dozen reports. That's Friday night. They're going out with their
770.54s - 775.58s |  buddies going, I'm going to quit my job because I just awarded $6,000 in bounties. I am the most
776.22s - 781.90s |  badass mofo on this planet. I'm quitting my job. He goes out, he parties. Saturday, he parties.
781.90s - 786.70s |  He maxes out the credit card because I've got $7,000 in bounties and money I rejected all in
786.70s - 794.30s |  10 minutes. He does not have happy words for me. And I'm going, yeah, this is all on our low impact
794.30s - 800.38s |  list. Did you read the documentation? And so these are the things you have to think through
800.38s - 805.58s |  is just slow down and ask yourself, what do I need to do? What is that triage you're going to do?
805.58s - 810.30s |  Because their job is to be a little critical and to force you to get better. So show the impact.
814.56s - 822.72s |  So if something didn't work out, you have to move on from that particular
822.72s - 829.28s |  thing. And you have to, I mean, there are a lot of stuff in the world, so you can move on and do
829.28s - 839.04s |  other stuff too. So maybe you will get lucky to have more success on that particular program
839.04s - 850.64s |  rather than the previous one. So I moved on at that time. And I heard about Nokia phone was,
851.28s - 858.80s |  there was a Nokia phone coming at that time. So they were running a VDP program, but their VDP
858.80s - 863.92s |  program is something like that. If you're finding any critical vulnerabilities on their program,
863.92s - 875.76s |  so they giving out their smartphones to hackers. So what I did, I listed out all their assets
875.76s - 883.92s |  and I started fuzzing for just for SQLite, because I was kind of more proficient into
883.92s - 890.64s |  finding a SQLite at that time. So this is how we react when a new program, when we see a new
890.64s - 902.00s |  program. So like I said, I listed out all their assets and started testing the SQLite. And one of
902.00s - 911.28s |  their assets, I got a SQL error. And further, I went ahead and just one or two commands and I was
911.28s - 920.72s |  able to dump their whole DB. So from here, they actually sent me some Lumia 820 devices.
924.08s - 928.64s |  So I think the one thing that we can take from this part of what Nix did, and you heard him say,
928.64s - 934.08s |  this was an area I was interested in. If you have an area that you have an interest in,
934.08s - 940.32s |  or that you have experience in your full time job, if you're a SQL database engineer, you're in
940.32s - 948.40s |  good shape. Because you know what to do with those databases to get SQL injections. If you are a web
948.40s - 954.96s |  designer, you've got a lot of that stuff to understand how to abuse HTML. So use the stuff
954.96s - 959.60s |  that you're interested in. And all of a sudden he said, I focus on just SQLite. Focus on that one
959.60s - 965.44s |  thing. Then take that one thing, run with it until you become the expert at it. You're going to start
965.44s - 970.24s |  getting to where you feel it. I've heard these guys a lot of times just say, I felt this, I just
970.24s - 975.92s |  knew it was there. That sixth sense is developed by repetition and doing it over and over. And when
975.92s - 981.04s |  you do that, you become really proficient in that thing. And so what you're seeing, I think that
981.04s - 987.68s |  Nix is describing is focus on that subject. Don't let yourself go for everything. The field is huge.
988.56s - 992.16s |  Focus on one or two things until you get proficient at it. Then you can add a new thing.
993.20s - 997.44s |  And so yeah, smartphones are not bad. Also, he's shifted to a program to add less competition.
998.80s - 1004.24s |  Sometimes, especially if you're new, going up against guys like this, it's going to be a tough
1004.24s - 1009.04s |  road. If you can go against the people, you know, who are a little less skilled, because he's not
1009.04s - 1015.28s |  going out for smartphones today. You know, maybe there are recognition programs. You know, there
1015.28s - 1019.36s |  may be a good point to going there and learning and using that as an education tool.
1022.93s - 1031.73s |  So key takeaways from this is don't give up anytime. And when one opportunity closes,
1031.73s - 1042.85s |  the other opens up. So if you find any critical vulnerabilities on any of the assets, and if you
1042.93s - 1055.65s |  get a good bug and a good reward, so you will get a lot of motivation out of it. So what motivation
1055.65s - 1066.85s |  do? Motivation actually do a lot of big things. Like in bug bounties, motivation counts a lot,
1066.85s - 1072.93s |  because if you're motivated, then you will be able to find more impactful vulnerabilities.
1073.49s - 1084.45s |  So I got motivated because of the last critical bug I found on the Nokia program. And I continued.
1085.09s - 1097.97s |  So in mid-2013, there was more programs come up, such as Mozilla started their web services
1097.97s - 1108.29s |  bug bounties. Baracuda Labs also has a web application firewall bug bounties running,
1108.29s - 1119.25s |  and they actually given out live devices on a virtual platform. And the PayPal is running since
1119.25s - 1133.73s |  2009. All of these running independent programs. So I was able to get some issues on these programs
1133.73s - 1147.17s |  and get some bounties out of it. So like I said, these are all things which I did when I got some
1147.17s - 1155.97s |  motivation from the last bugs. So it's kind of thing that if I continue doing Google, I might
1155.97s - 1166.85s |  get $500 or $1,000 bounty after two or three years. But I lost all my motivation till then,
1166.85s - 1174.29s |  because you're doing bug bounties till three years, and you are only getting $500 or $1,000
1175.41s - 1183.89s |  or something like that. But what I did, I keep on learning things from my rejections. So
1184.37s - 1195.01s |  I get a failure from Google, but I also ask them why you rejected my bug. So they actually explain
1195.01s - 1205.73s |  you that why we rejected. So they also tells you that if you can do this, then we can accept that
1205.73s - 1215.33s |  bug and move it to the award category. So that is how the motivation works.
1216.13s - 1221.81s |  Yeah. One important note here from the triage side, it's your triagers are always happy to tell
1221.81s - 1226.85s |  you why something wasn't accepted. I don't think any of our triagers just go, I don't have time,
1226.85s - 1233.17s |  go away. Because what we're trying to do is show you what number one did not work. So that way,
1233.17s - 1237.57s |  quite frankly, you don't fill up my inbox with junk and keep doing the same thing again.
1238.69s - 1244.13s |  So if you get a rejection, ask and try and understand why. And a lot of times they'll
1244.13s - 1250.69s |  be able to tell you, but if you can do this, now I'll take it. So that's your kind of explanation.
1250.69s - 1255.33s |  And this usually resolves around impact, but they'll be able to tell you, hey, this is just,
1255.33s - 1259.57s |  we're going to be low impact. We kind of don't care about this. You know, you had an eye door.
1259.57s - 1262.77s |  Yeah, you could get into somebody else's account, but you know what, you weren't logged in.
1263.41s - 1267.09s |  You're just changing their basket at, you know, the pizza place and get rid of a pizza.
1267.65s - 1271.01s |  Who cares? You know, you're not getting them to pay for your pizza.
1271.97s - 1276.93s |  So understand why they're looking at it the way they are. For example, cross-site scripting.
1276.93s - 1280.93s |  If you're not logged in, there's no data to come out of it. There's no malicious use.
1280.93s - 1286.53s |  They'll be clearly happy to say, hey, it's an unauthenticated cross-site scripting. I can't
1286.53s - 1291.09s |  take that. There's no impact. So ask them, communicate. They are very happy to communicate
1291.09s - 1295.73s |  these things. And part of their job is to think through them and go, okay, why won't I accept
1295.73s - 1301.81s |  this? So they know the reason. So talk to them, take that feedback and learn. I've seen way too
1301.81s - 1307.65s |  many people come in and just say, I submit the flaw. It gets rejected and I tell you why. And
1307.65s - 1313.41s |  next week you submit the same flaw and it gets rejected. And I tell you why. And a few days
1313.41s - 1319.25s |  later you submit a flaw. So just the same. And we go through this process and it keeps knocking
1319.25s - 1324.05s |  down the researcher's motivation, which is not at all what we want to do, but it's taking that
1324.05s - 1329.57s |  feedback and understanding what they're saying. They are now your teachers to help educate you
1329.57s - 1334.21s |  to how to make yourself a better pen tester in your normal day job, how to become a better bug
1334.21s - 1339.97s |  bounty hunter, how to improve overall. It may be that we're saying improve your reporting techniques,
1340.53s - 1345.01s |  you know, that I need more detailed steps. A lot of times you guys will be in that app for hours.
1345.01s - 1350.53s |  I have never seen it before. I'm walking into a blind to reproduce your bone and try and
1350.53s - 1353.97s |  understand, does it have impact? If you haven't clearly explained it, clearly showed me,
1355.57s - 1359.33s |  maybe I can't do it because I don't have the details and the knowledge of, oh, I redid this.
1360.13s - 1365.01s |  So make sure you're very clear to us, explain it, understand why we rejected it and ask questions.
1367.94s - 1377.22s |  So in 2014 or mid-2014, there was, I got to know about these three platforms running
1378.18s - 1387.94s |  some bug bounty programs on their platform. And while Hackovan and Bug Crowd was available to
1387.94s - 1395.54s |  sign up directly and the SINAC was doing some hands-on assessment, which includes written and
1395.54s - 1407.73s |  ID verification or something like that. And once you passed on the written and ID verification,
1407.73s - 1414.61s |  you will be onboarded on the platform. But the other two platforms, they are
1415.41s - 1425.25s |  directly available for signup. I guess Hackovan do not have a web application,
1426.21s - 1431.09s |  bug bounty program until the Yahoo comes in 2014.
1432.93s - 1435.65s |  I just noticed the spinach logo. I hadn't seen that forever.
1437.65s - 1441.41s |  So one of the things that kind of is interesting about the bug bounty model,
1441.41s - 1445.01s |  and a lot of you guys are kind of like, why do those companies exist? First of all, for you guys,
1445.01s - 1448.93s |  it consolidates it. It gives you one place you can find a bunch of targets instead of having
1448.93s - 1452.77s |  to Google all over the place. Additionally, you don't have to send it to the company and
1452.77s - 1456.93s |  hope that they don't just go, yeah, I'm going to reject that, but thank you. And I'm going to fix
1456.93s - 1462.21s |  it anyway. You know, we're kind of your middleman there to protect you. But that said, we're also
1462.21s - 1468.13s |  hired for the company's protection to reduce the noise and go through and say, is this valid for
1468.13s - 1472.69s |  them on their behalf? And we're an impartial third party. I can tell you that when I paid a vol,
1472.69s - 1477.25s |  there was nothing. It doesn't come out of my pocket. It was a big joke to a lot of people
1477.25s - 1480.21s |  like, oh, they're lowering my CVSS. They don't want to pay this. They don't want to pay that.
1480.77s - 1485.25s |  We're in the business to pay vols. If I don't pay any vols on the target, my client gets mad.
1486.05s - 1490.69s |  So I need to pay these vols. If I've got a bonus out there, I need to kind of pay it. That's why
1490.69s - 1497.09s |  I'm putting a bonus on it. The money becomes, I can say this after paying thousands and thousands,
1497.09s - 1501.41s |  probably well over a couple, probably half a million dollars out that I've spent personally.
1502.13s - 1507.17s |  It's monopoly money to me. I press that button. It's not 500. It's not a thousand.
1507.17s - 1513.73s |  It's not $4,000. It's just a button. It doesn't matter to me. It never processes in my head that
1513.73s - 1519.49s |  I just spent $10,000. So your triagers are not sitting and thinking, I need to hold on this
1519.49s - 1523.97s |  money. That's not how it works for us. We don't even get really accountable for it. It's just,
1523.97s - 1528.21s |  did we do it right? Was it a valid vol? Yeah. Did you pay what it's supposed to be paid? Yep. Okay,
1528.21s - 1533.49s |  good. So your triagers are not trying to hold this money back. We don't get bonuses based off
1533.49s - 1541.01s |  what I didn't pay you guys. That's not the whole different game if it was. So understand that the
1541.01s - 1545.89s |  bounty platforms are actually here to number one, show you where everything's at so that you can be
1545.89s - 1549.89s |  efficient with your time and not have to search new projects. Number two, we're your impartial
1549.89s - 1555.25s |  third party to make sure that what you're submitting is good for our clients and that
1555.25s - 1565.23s |  the clients are being fair to you. So when HackerOne started their first program, that is
1565.23s - 1576.19s |  Yahoo. So I got the first book and it is Yahoo mobile mail accesses. And they paid me only $277.
1577.55s - 1585.95s |  And so I was confused at why it is paid so low because it was under their Yahoo mobile email,
1585.95s - 1594.43s |  that is their main application. So I think then I thought I probably lagged at demonstrating the
1594.43s - 1605.55s |  impact here. And that's why the bounty was so low. Then the bug crowd, I submitted like 48 plus 29,
1605.55s - 1614.35s |  I don't know how much it is. And so just 29 accepted and 48 was duplicate. So when you do
1614.35s - 1623.63s |  bug bounty, duplicates are part of it. And you just have to take into consideration that you
1623.63s - 1628.83s |  will get the duplicates because someone will be faster than you in submitting the vulnerabilities.
1628.83s - 1638.59s |  If someone has automation, they will be more faster than you. And then the last, the report
1638.59s - 1650.67s |  writing. So I had a worst report writing at that time. And it was causing a lot of problems to me.
1651.55s - 1658.59s |  So that is the struggle. So yeah. I'm going to say this on report writing.
1659.71s - 1665.23s |  I've worked with a lot of our top guys and have said, some of them come back and said,
1665.23s - 1669.71s |  at first I hated y'all. I thought y'all were just running me through the ringer. I thought
1669.71s - 1674.67s |  you were going to have to do all this stuff, jumping through all the hoops. And later they
1674.67s - 1679.63s |  said, at my day job, I'm now 10 times better at writing a report because of what you made me do.
1680.99s - 1686.19s |  We don't want these reports that say, there's an injection. Here's your line.
1686.19s - 1692.59s |  Impact. I took your stuff. Y'all got to give me more than that. You've got to write it as
1692.59s - 1698.19s |  a compelling story. Because when I go to a CISO and particularly if I go to a CEO,
1698.91s - 1703.15s |  I hate to tell you guys, he doesn't know nor care what an idol is. He doesn't care what SQLI is.
1704.59s - 1708.27s |  He doesn't know that's not his job to know those things. He goes to SQLI. I don't,
1708.27s - 1712.67s |  whatever. If I tell him, I just downloaded your entire database and can delete your entire
1713.23s - 1718.43s |  production database. And I know who all your customers are. Are you caring now? Now he cares
1718.43s - 1724.03s |  because he knows that that's a newsworthy item. Tell me that scary story. Do this in detail.
1724.59s - 1728.59s |  Show me what can happen. You don't have to actually go out and publish it on the dark web
1728.59s - 1734.19s |  of course. That wouldn't work out well for us. But if you go ahead and you just say, look,
1734.19s - 1741.31s |  cross-site scripting, I've got document.cookie. I can send this out to my server and now harvest
1741.31s - 1745.79s |  credentials. And it's, you know, now it's persistent. Any logged in user, I can pull
1745.79s - 1750.19s |  that from them. If they go to that page, I can get your leads. I can get your engineers. I can
1750.19s - 1755.63s |  get your creds too. Now you've told me a scary story that I can take to the client. You've also
1755.63s - 1760.67s |  made it clear to the triage team who may not be as clear on that type of bond as you are. Because
1760.67s - 1765.31s |  like we said, you're working to become that world-class expert in it. You may actually know
1765.31s - 1770.67s |  more about that impact. So clarify your impact, write those reports, take a little bit longer
1770.67s - 1776.83s |  and write a more verbose story. Really give us extremely detailed steps as our reproduce.
1778.11s - 1781.95s |  And then give us some good feedback on how to fix this thing. Because you may know more than
1781.95s - 1785.23s |  the engineering team because to be blunt, they screwed it up in the first place.
1786.19s - 1791.39s |  So tell us, talk to us, be that story writer. I know as technical people, we want to keep it
1791.39s - 1796.51s |  concise to the point and no extra fat. In this case, sometimes getting a little wordier is worth
1796.51s - 1801.95s |  the time and will significantly improve your reporting. When you have a report that I love,
1803.31s - 1807.71s |  it's clear to me. And now I can start accepting it a lot more. If you start giving me garbage
1807.71s - 1811.47s |  reports that are real brief and real short, it's real easy for me to miss your point
1812.43s - 1815.87s |  and what you're actually getting at. So make sure you explain it,
1815.87s - 1819.23s |  over explain it a little bit. Tell me those scary stories and the impact.
1820.59s - 1827.71s |  Yeah. So I figured out that what are the shortcomings? It's like always looking,
1827.71s - 1833.79s |  I'm always looking for low hanging fruits, worst report writing, lacking chaining the report to
1833.79s - 1840.11s |  make it more impactful and obviously not so fast in reporting and the target approach.
1840.83s - 1845.87s |  Nix, I'm going to say one thing about low hanging fruit. When I first started, I thought Metasploit
1845.87s - 1851.39s |  was the answer to everything. Great tool, a lot of fun. In two and a half years, I saw exactly
1851.39s - 1856.43s |  one ball that was found with Metasploit. I was doing dozens a day. It's a very well-known tool
1856.43s - 1860.91s |  that's a low hanging fruit. Your dev team should be using it. If they're not, they need to be,
1860.91s - 1866.91s |  right? These scanners, we're going to have to go deeper. You're going to have to really learn
1866.91s - 1870.83s |  about the exploit, not just depend on the low hanging fruit popping from the scanners.
1871.39s - 1876.19s |  If that's what you're depending on, you've got a long road. You've got to get a little more
1876.19s - 1881.79s |  creative and do a little more. Some things are easy. Yeah, there's a few, sometimes cross-site
1881.79s - 1885.79s |  script things are really simple, but sometimes they're not. You've got to go a little farther
1885.79s - 1889.63s |  and the scanners may not point it out to you. You may have to start thinking through it and get a
1889.63s - 1899.39s |  little more creative. I started taking things a little seriously and I was delving into more
1899.39s - 1905.87s |  impactful findings and blogs by other researchers, learning from the community and exploring other
1905.87s - 1912.51s |  pen test reports, excellently written reports to figure out what actually going wrong from my end
1912.59s - 1920.35s |  and adapting the platforms, how platforms are working, what are the target rotations
1920.91s - 1933.31s |  and what programs are less eyes and what programs has more eyes and obviously the CTFN labs are
1933.31s - 1937.71s |  quite helpful because you will get to learn how the exploits is working.
1938.19s - 1946.43s |  And the one more thing, the one target, you have to target one at a time. So you will get a better
1947.39s - 1952.11s |  idea about how the target is working and how their business logic is.
1953.79s - 1958.59s |  Yeah. So learning from the community, one of the big things I've seen, and I'm going to say
1958.59s - 1963.71s |  something a little blasphemous right now. If you come into bug bounty hunting and you're looking
1963.71s - 1969.31s |  for the money, you're probably going to have a hard road. If you come into it and say, I have
1969.31s - 1974.11s |  paid thousands on courses, I have paid thousands for school and I paid a lot of money to get
1974.11s - 1979.87s |  certifications. This is free. You're going to be in the right mind space. Let the money come when
1979.87s - 1984.67s |  it will, right? That's a bonus. This is free training that you may actually get a little bit
1984.67s - 1989.47s |  of money for. As you start seeing that, you're going to start finding success. The people who
1989.47s - 1993.95s |  I know who came into it, who said, I just want to sharpen my skills are very successful. The
1993.95s - 1998.67s |  people who come into it and immediately I'm like, I need to pay a bill next weekend. I need to have
1998.67s - 2003.23s |  beer for Friday. You're going to have a hard time. You're going to get frustrated. So come into it
2003.79s - 2010.27s |  mind space wise and say, I'm wanting to learn and use the community. Whether it is discord,
2011.07s - 2015.63s |  the different channels that we have set up, we have Slack channels that you can actually just
2015.63s - 2019.95s |  reach out and say, Hey Nix, I'm kind of stuck now. He's not going to go and say, Hey, here's
2019.95s - 2024.35s |  a cross that script and they'll find it because he's also looking for it. Right? But if you're
2024.35s - 2028.51s |  stuck and you have a good idea, you're like, I just don't have this payload. Where can I look
2028.51s - 2034.03s |  for more info? That's where you can reach out for help from the community. Nobody's going to give
2034.03s - 2039.07s |  you the free answer, but you can start getting hit. You figure out how to get better and you've
2039.07s - 2045.07s |  got access to world-class trainers because they are doing it. So reach out, educate yourself,
2045.07s - 2051.07s |  use this as an education tool, use the community. Each of the platforms has a community person
2051.79s - 2055.79s |  who is there to help you succeed. That's their job. So use that.
2056.51s - 2065.55s |  So in my previous point, I delve into a target approach and platform adoption.
2065.55s - 2073.15s |  So what I mean to say from the platform adoption is, let's say H1, HackerOne and Buckrowd was
2073.15s - 2079.47s |  accepting reports on a first-come-first-served basis. But the other platform like SINAC is
2080.19s - 2088.43s |  using a quality rule during 2016 to 2023. And the quality rule is something like that,
2088.43s - 2100.03s |  that they choose the best written report during that time. And even if you submitted last and the
2100.03s - 2108.43s |  report is fine, then they submit the last report on the basis of just the report writing.
2108.43s - 2115.63s |  But this has been removed now and they start using first-come-first-served only.
2115.63s - 2122.83s |  So that is the platform adoption because you have to know what is going on
2122.83s - 2129.87s |  on the platform and how to work on the particular platform.
2131.07s - 2134.99s |  Yeah, each platform is a little different. And so when you're working with them,
2134.99s - 2139.47s |  make sure you know what your rules are. The first thing when you get on the platform,
2139.47s - 2145.55s |  read all the rules. And that's really kind of simple. I'll say the SINAC setup is fairly
2145.55s - 2150.27s |  complicated because you've got a VPN, you've got a VM, and you've got dedicated IPs that
2150.27s - 2154.67s |  you're coming from. When you're going with some others, maybe you need to note,
2154.67s - 2158.91s |  I'm a researcher in there because you're not on that secured network. They don't know who you are.
2159.71s - 2163.95s |  And you're sending attack traffic at a live target, guys. If they don't know who you are,
2163.95s - 2168.99s |  that may alarm them. So go and find out the rules. Make sure you're really clear before you go start
2168.99s - 2173.47s |  sending attack traffic and figure out which platform works for you. There is no one answer.
2173.47s - 2176.51s |  There is different platforms because they have different strengths and weaknesses.
2177.07s - 2181.23s |  So find out what works for you. And a lot of people work on all of them. There's no downside
2181.23s - 2187.39s |  to that. One interesting note, even though the quality rule, the QR, is now not a thing.
2188.43s - 2192.35s |  The reason why that happened was to make sure that the reports had good quality
2192.91s - 2200.27s |  and that they were written well. So you go back to remember what I said about write the report well.
2200.91s - 2204.91s |  That was what we were trying to get out there. So it was that important that we actually had
2204.91s - 2211.55s |  an entire rule around this and had platform-based stuff on it. So just remember that the triage is
2211.55s - 2219.07s |  going to very favorably respond to that good report writing. So when I have all of this in mind
2219.07s - 2226.11s |  and I refine my skills, I actually able to find some good vulnerabilities starting from
2226.43s - 2237.63s |  the HelloSign one. This was found in 2015. It was straight NSSRF that is called through the
2237.63s - 2243.95s |  event callback functionality. And I was able to call back their past WD file.
2247.31s - 2254.91s |  And Microsoft started their bug bounty program for online services in 2014, late 2014.
2254.91s - 2263.47s |  I submitted multiple reports and 90% reports got accepted while 10% got
2264.43s - 2275.63s |  duplicated only. So I was pretty fast. I understand what to do for a particular program.
2276.19s - 2284.35s |  And I target only one program at a time. And I focus more on high-impact vulnerabilities.
2284.35s - 2296.43s |  And then later I got listed into MSRC top 100 and also awarded with this laptop.
2299.87s - 2305.55s |  Then I came in full-time pursuit because I created a financial backup out of whatever
2305.55s - 2313.47s |  bug bounties I have got. I stepped away from 9-to-5 job and I turned into the full-time
2313.55s - 2321.39s |  bug bounty hunter. So that's how you can start being a full-time bug bounty hunter. You create a
2321.39s - 2327.15s |  backup for yourself and then only you can step away from a daily job and
2329.47s - 2334.91s |  start doing a full-time bug bounty. Because bug bounty has a lot of money,
2334.91s - 2341.23s |  but it also gives you a lot of stress too. Yeah. So one thing I'll say is that we've
2341.23s - 2345.71s |  noticed that first of all, he's started incorporating these techniques of listening,
2345.71s - 2350.75s |  improving his reporting, focusing, and starting to see success. One thing really important to
2350.75s - 2354.83s |  notice, and I've told people this a lot of times, if you're going to go out and Saturday you're
2354.83s - 2357.71s |  going to go, yep, I'm going to go bug hunt. I'm going to spend four hours on it and I'm
2357.71s - 2361.95s |  going to do a few hours on Sunday and see what happens. Your odds of success are almost zero,
2361.95s - 2367.39s |  okay? If that's your first time out there, it's going to take you a while, guys. Average
2367.39s - 2372.27s |  vols come in, your first average vol is 20 hours of research, okay? But then as he said,
2372.27s - 2375.63s |  it keeps getting faster. Then it becomes 10, then it becomes five, then it becomes two,
2375.63s - 2379.07s |  then it becomes 30 minutes, then it becomes 10 minutes to find a single lie.
2380.03s - 2384.99s |  But you have to put in the time. If you're planning on doing this, I'd say there's a 40-hour
2384.99s - 2390.59s |  rule here. Then if you're going to have a 98% chance of success, plan on spending 40 hours
2391.47s - 2396.67s |  dedicated and have most of it on one to two targets. Get to know that thing really well.
2397.71s - 2402.19s |  Spend that 40 hours, then assess whether this is for you or not. Because if you quit too soon,
2402.75s - 2405.87s |  you're not going to really benefit from it. You've got to be persistent.
2405.87s - 2410.59s |  You're going to start doing that and start seeing income coming in. Now, you may have a little shoe
2410.59s - 2415.15s |  box of income that you're like, okay, I'm making enough to take my family to a really nice dinner
2415.15s - 2420.35s |  this month. That's what I got off Bug Bounty is that really nice dinner, great steakhouse,
2421.07s - 2425.71s |  great. And you may be happy with that. Maybe you want the little bucket that's enough to
2425.71s - 2431.79s |  make a car payment. Maybe you start realizing it's getting bigger. We had one of our analysts,
2432.83s - 2437.79s |  really bright guy, senior analyst, paid him fairly well, of course. And he was bug hunting on the
2437.79s - 2444.59s |  side. And on very limited, very hardened targets, we started seeing he was making a lot of money
2444.59s - 2450.11s |  to the point that he was making more as a bug hunter than he was as a full-time security analyst.
2450.11s - 2454.59s |  And everybody asked him, why don't you quit? He goes, well, I like the guaranteed income, right?
2454.59s - 2460.19s |  Okay, fair enough. Finally, he got to the point that, and he had the money banked back,
2460.19s - 2465.55s |  sitting in the bank to float him for a while. But he realized that he was actually losing money
2465.55s - 2470.35s |  by working full-time as a security analyst. And that was when he decided to quit and go full-time.
2471.23s - 2476.91s |  So, wait on the money and use the education time and start watching where that bucket of
2476.91s - 2480.19s |  money is doing, how often it comes in, and then you can make those decisions.
2480.91s - 2486.83s |  Please do not jump off next week and go, I'm that good, I've got my OSCP, I've got my OSCE,
2486.83s - 2491.39s |  I'm going to become a full-time bounty hunter. Because that very well may turn out to be a very
2491.39s - 2495.95s |  bad financial decision, even if you're the best out there. You've got to have some time to figure
2495.95s - 2500.35s |  out what is your income going to look like from this. And so, use that time to spin up and figure
2500.35s - 2504.51s |  that out. And that's when you can start stepping aside from the nine to five with this.
2505.15s - 2511.63s |  So, when you've got motivation and some confidence, you can do better in the longer terms.
2511.63s - 2519.79s |  But you need to back by some good findings in order to keep those bug bounty hunter
2519.79s - 2526.27s |  carrier running. So, I'm moving on to some key discoveries that I've found during my
2527.23s - 2534.03s |  bug bounty hunting. A couple of them, like first one is SQL injection in
2535.23s - 2541.15s |  biggest e-commerce solution in the world. So, you can guess about it.
2542.91s - 2550.67s |  So, I was on boarded on a target at this e-commerce solution. And while modifying the
2550.67s - 2563.63s |  profile, I came across a country ID. And just a second. Okay. Sorry. I think this
2564.27s - 2575.90s |  slide, I don't know how it comes. So, yeah. So, it was an online car marketplace.
2575.90s - 2587.66s |  And so, I started running brute force on directories and files. And the application
2587.66s - 2595.58s |  keep redirecting me to the login page on each directory and file brute force. Like that.
2596.54s - 2608.70s |  And each getting redirected to 302. And it was kind of loop. And I tried to change the methods.
2608.70s - 2615.90s |  But I got the same result out of it. But so, what I do, I notice the application is using
2615.90s - 2623.50s |  a third party solutions. So, what I do, I went to the third party solution and found it was
2624.06s - 2632.06s |  a hosted e-commerce solution they're using. So, what I do, I went ahead and
2634.38s - 2639.66s |  see if there's any demo version available of the application. I couldn't find any demo version
2639.66s - 2650.46s |  available anywhere. So, what I did, I did a subdomain brute force of the third party provider.
2650.46s - 2663.39s |  And I found a demo version running. And the demo version, these are all the demo versions
2663.39s - 2671.95s |  that are available for that application. And after exploring a bit and watching the YouTube videos,
2672.43s - 2694.37s |  I found that once, I mean, there was a I found like I was looking for a path from the application
2694.37s - 2703.09s |  which I couldn't get. But after getting the demo version of it, I found that the application
2703.09s - 2708.53s |  do not have any authentication. But it was totally unauthenticated. They have added some
2709.97s - 2719.65s |  rules in the path that was denying me to actually accessing the direct path in the application. So,
2722.05s - 2731.57s |  what I did, I just used that demo version to retract all the paths. And I just changed the
2731.57s - 2739.25s |  domain name from the application. And I started fuzzing for vulnerability on all the parameters
2740.13s - 2747.65s |  that has been into that has been used into the application. And I found that I was
2748.53s - 2757.17s |  able to dump all of their databases because one parameter was vulnerable to SQLite.
2761.57s - 2772.29s |  Then this is one of the banking asset that I got. So, what they are doing that they are fetching
2772.29s - 2785.97s |  one JavaScript file from a CDN filename parameter. And what I did, so, CDN filename takes file input
2785.97s - 2793.73s |  from file input such as user underscore tools.bundle. So, in the comment, I have seen
2793.73s - 2804.93s |  there was a comment that the file comment which is having an API.github.com. And that user
2804.93s - 2814.93s |  dot user tools.bundle was printed in that particular path. So, I thought that let's do one
2814.93s - 2826.61s |  thing. That's user dot dot slash to come on to the root path and then try to use API.github.com
2826.61s - 2844.29s |  to query the internal data from the GitHub API. So, I just used the events query and I was able
2844.37s - 2853.57s |  to dump their internal events, all the events from the CDN file parameter as only because
2856.53s - 2867.01s |  the dot dot slash was taking all the file path to API.github.com only. Do you want to add something?
2867.97s - 2872.21s |  Right now, this is your fault. So, I'm going to let you go with that. You know, some of the things
2872.21s - 2876.61s |  that I'm thinking about in the back of my head right now is just the persistence. And some of
2876.61s - 2881.73s |  the things that we're kind of looking at is how do we succeed? You know, and so, I'd say the
2881.73s - 2886.69s |  persistence, keeping at it, learning, those are some of your key takeaways for how you start doing
2886.69s - 2892.85s |  this and how you start making money. How do we start succeeding in bug bounty? And just understanding
2892.85s - 2898.05s |  that there is a learning path. So, that's kind of where I'm thinking right now. But keep running
2898.05s - 2905.73s |  with the balls, man. I always like balls. So, this was an account takeover vulnerability. So,
2905.73s - 2913.09s |  after doing subdomain discovery, I stumbled across a subdomain and it was giving a 403
2913.81s - 2922.13s |  forbidden error. So, the 404 written error looks interesting to me. So, what I did, I just did a
2922.13s - 2928.69s |  quick Google search and it was listing out a lot of applications. But one of the applications looks
2928.69s - 2937.09s |  interesting. So, but it was asking for some deviant ID, which I do not know because that is
2937.09s - 2948.05s |  some unique thing. So, I searched everywhere deviant ID was not available anywhere. So, I just
2948.05s - 2957.33s |  did a simple Google search on deviant ID on images section. And I got some
2957.33s - 2968.05s |  yumpu.com having a lot of contract IDs available under the papers. And they have
2968.61s - 2978.85s |  them as a deviant ID as a deviant ID field. So, I collected all those deviant IDs from the
2978.85s - 2988.37s |  Google images section. And all those images are available on some yumpu.com site. I don't
2988.37s - 2997.09s |  know how to get it. So, in the subject section, they have a lot of these deviant IDs available.
2997.09s - 3004.37s |  I used those deviant IDs and I went to the application. I just used the forget password.
3004.37s - 3012.37s |  And I have seen that the past, the application was actually fetching the password for that
3012.37s - 3020.21s |  particular deviant ID and sending to the user in the plain text format in one request itself.
3020.21s - 3025.09s |  So, I just used that particular password and deviant ID to log into the application.
3027.23s - 3032.91s |  So, one thing I'm going to point out here is that you said something really interesting. I didn't
3032.91s - 3037.71s |  know what it was. So, I started looking for it. Google it. Google is your friend, right? I don't
3037.71s - 3042.91s |  know how we would ever begin to hack before Google was what it is now. A lot of your time is going to
3042.91s - 3047.87s |  be spent researching. Nobody in this room knows everything about everything in cyber. And if you
3047.87s - 3053.39s |  think you do, I would love to talk to you. Look at these things. When you see something you don't
3053.39s - 3059.15s |  understand, take a curiosity. Many times I've seen something that I've been like, okay, what is it?
3059.15s - 3064.03s |  All of a sudden, I find out that is a key piece of information that is not supposed to be shared.
3064.03s - 3068.11s |  This is a private something that is really sensitive. All of a sudden, I can start finding
3068.11s - 3073.23s |  out, wait, these are used for that? Really? Okay. Now, I'm interested in that parameter that was
3073.23s - 3077.79s |  just something weird beforehand. So, take the time to really understand the apps.
3078.59s - 3084.67s |  This is why earlier we said stop. Look at that one target. Get to know it. Go and spend five,
3084.67s - 3089.07s |  ten hours on that target to really know it in depth. And part of that is just going to be
3089.07s - 3094.11s |  your research time to understand what all these parameters are. DVM means something. They didn't
3094.11s - 3098.51s |  just come up with that randomly. So, what is it? What are they trying to communicate with that
3098.51s - 3103.15s |  number? Understand that, and you're going to have a lot better chance of success in finding the right
3103.15s - 3108.67s |  places to manipulate and poke. So, when you said I went and I Googled it, I wasn't familiar with it,
3108.67s - 3113.95s |  that's part of that time we said spend a lot of time on that target. Use that curiosity. Of course,
3113.95s - 3117.95s |  a lot of them are going to be nothing interesting, but it's when you find that one interesting that
3117.95s - 3122.19s |  you're like, oh, really? That whole parameter controls the entire account for admins.
3123.31s - 3128.11s |  Interesting. Now, I want to play with that one. So, it's going to help you focus whenever you
3128.11s - 3132.11s |  start doing these researches on things you don't understand and see it's kind of weirdness.
3132.75s - 3140.35s |  This was another one was an SSR of an ASM solution. The target launched and there was
3140.35s - 3147.31s |  no vulnerability submitted on it, no vulnerability accepted on it. So, this makes me curious that
3147.31s - 3155.31s |  why? So, I started digging into the application. So, what application is doing? It starts doing
3155.79s - 3162.27s |  recon for subdomain IP address and all the certs and it also creates a screenshot of
3162.27s - 3167.95s |  a parent domain too. So, I got interested that if it is creating a screenshot of that parent too,
3168.83s - 3182.11s |  maybe I can use some domains and redirect that domains to my custom payload and
3182.83s - 3191.31s |  that custom payload might come up, might extract some information from their internal
3192.19s - 3203.31s |  system and capture it as a screenshot. So, what I did, that is their application and
3203.87s - 3211.95s |  they are just creating a screenshot of whatever application is. So, what I did,
3213.55s - 3222.67s |  they were using Amazon as an infrastructure services. So, what I did, I just put this
3223.07s - 3237.07s |  and try to extract the data from their screenshots. So, that's how the screenshot is.
3238.11s - 3245.63s |  It was all empty. There was nothing on it. So, I was curious that why it's not coming
3246.19s - 3253.15s |  it's not coming as a screenshot. So, I was researching more on this application and I
3253.15s - 3260.75s |  found out that they are not using an EC2, but they are using the Lambda. So, I went to the
3260.75s - 3269.79s |  Twitter and I searched for what exactly the what how exactly I can do SSR with the Lambda. So, I
3270.27s - 3277.23s |  got a tweet that if you're if someone is using the Lambda function, you can particularly use
3277.23s - 3286.43s |  this particular request to actually query the internal data. So, next I created another
3287.55s - 3296.27s |  redirect request and it actually extracting the data from their Lambda function as a screenshot.
3296.27s - 3306.35s |  So, I again passed it into for the execution and what I did, it actually captures their
3307.47s - 3315.47s |  Lambda whatever Lambda event is running internally as a screenshot. So, that's
3316.99s - 3322.11s |  these are all key discoveries that I found in the solution.
3322.59s - 3326.19s |  So, as we're getting to write up, there's been one question that I've asked you before,
3326.19s - 3332.35s |  but I thought it was really kind of an interesting answer and I think a lot of people here. You are
3332.35s - 3339.31s |  globally known. You're on the Microsoft Hall of Fame, SYNAC Legends. You do well. We're up here
3339.31s - 3346.19s |  today. Talk to me a little bit about imposter syndrome. Do you have it still? Yeah, I mean,
3346.99s - 3352.91s |  I regularly, I mean, if you go to Twitter and you will find a lot of bug bounty tips.
3353.71s - 3362.51s |  So, you will get those imposter syndrome because looking at those, because I mean,
3362.51s - 3368.59s |  you will find someone like you must be missing something. You must be missing something out
3368.59s - 3375.55s |  from somewhere. I mean, someone is more skilled than you and you are lacking some,
3375.55s - 3380.99s |  some of the skills because they are getting more bounties, more impactful bugs. So,
3380.99s - 3389.55s |  obviously that's coming out into your mind, but maybe that person has been doing research from
3389.55s - 3396.59s |  last three, four months and then he found that impactful vulnerability. So, it depends on total
3396.59s - 3402.83s |  situation and you do not have to panic from that. I think that's the key there is don't panic just
3402.83s - 3407.15s |  because you miss something or because you didn't succeed. It doesn't mean you're wrong, right?
3407.95s - 3412.67s |  It just means that, Hey, let's keep going. You know, and I think one of the things you'd said
3412.67s - 3417.55s |  on that one time that really stuck with me and was that you woke up in the morning and kind of goes,
3418.11s - 3424.27s |  am I really here? Am I, this is what I'm doing for my job. And you get scared. And he said,
3424.35s - 3429.47s |  you sit down, start typing, start working, start to get in that mindset. Life starts running well.
3429.47s - 3432.83s |  Okay. Things are going good. Now I'll find a flaw. Now I'll find a second flaw. You know,
3432.83s - 3436.59s |  things are getting rejected. Things are getting accepted things. All that's going on any of the
3436.59s - 3440.11s |  day. You go, yeah, I got this. And the next morning you wake up and feel like you're fine.
3440.11s - 3445.71s |  Thank you again. So, I can say this, that stuck with me because I'm like, if he's doing it,
3446.35s - 3449.71s |  then it's not a problem if I'm doing it too. These are normal things for us,
3449.71s - 3453.15s |  especially when you add the full-time aspect of bug bounty and the pressure.
3453.79s - 3461.23s |  So just understand that the middle game is a lot in it and the persistence and understanding that's
3461.23s - 3467.07s |  where you're going to succeed in bug bounty is by being persistent, smart, intelligent,
3467.07s - 3471.55s |  go after it because yeah, you're competing against him, but he's also here to help you.
3472.51s - 3481.15s |  So like Charlie said that there are a lot of challenges while running the long time into
3481.15s - 3489.71s |  bug bounties. So imposter syndrome is one of them. Then if you're not earning one or two months,
3490.59s - 3496.67s |  you will start doubting yourself. Then the burnouts comes in and the frustration of,
3497.31s - 3504.91s |  if reports are rejecting or getting duplicated, the frustration comes in as well. And all of these
3504.91s - 3510.91s |  comes as a stress on you. So your mental health gets impacted.
3512.11s - 3516.19s |  So we're getting the signal to wrap it up, I think. Yeah, he's not back there.
3517.07s - 3521.31s |  So we will have these slides posted so you can go through, see some of the details on
3521.31s - 3525.55s |  this and cover it. But I think the basic thing is number one, treat this like a game.
3526.11s - 3530.59s |  Understand that it's a puzzle, own that puzzle and try and just keep it in that mindset.
3531.15s - 3537.31s |  Treat it as fun training and enjoy the process. Keep at it. You're going to get success if you
3537.31s - 3541.47s |  keep at it. It's one of those things, the more you work at it, the more likely you are to succeed.
3543.15s - 3549.55s |  Anything else to add? All right. Well, thank you guys. Appreciate it. Hope you had a good time.
