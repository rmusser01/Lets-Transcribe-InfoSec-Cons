  "title": "DEF CON 32 - Prime Cuts from Hacker History :40 Years of 31337 - Cult of the Dead Cow and Friends",
  "description": "The year is 1984\u2026 Ronald Reagan is President, it is a \u201cNew Mourning in America.\u201d In Texas, a small cabal of malcontents meet in an abandoned slaughterhouse, decorated with heavy metal band posters, satanic iconography, and, most ominously, the skull of a DEAD COW\u2026 As pirated copies of speedmetal and punk music play in the background, these erstwhile revolutionaries speak of their disillusion with The Way Things Are, and their obsession with their new computers. All over America, teens were waking to not just the typical dissatisfaction of adolescence, but the awareness that via these new modes of communication and interaction, they could meet like-minded others, have some illicit fun, and maybe, just maybe, change the goddamn world.\n\n1984 wasn\u2019t the beginning of hacking, but brought perhaps the first real blossoming of the culture. The spread of the personal computer, and the modem, brought the birth of not just cDc, but the Legion of Doom, and 2600 Magazine. 1985 would bring Phrack Magazine, and a true explosion in the written culture, with t-files becoming the currency of the Truly Elite. In this session, members of cDc, 2600, LoD, MoD, and r00t will talk about what made them hackers and phreaks, swap stories, and answer questions posed by Prof. Walter Scheirer of the University of Notre Dame and audience Q&A.",

0.27s - 5.43s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Um, so, some of you may know me, some of you might not, uh, my name's Death Veggie, I'm
5.43s - 9.51s |  the Minister of Propaganda for the Cult of the Dead Cow, uh, this is my, I don't know
9.51s - 12.55s |  how many DEF CONs, but the first one was DEF CON 3, so we've been around for a little bit
12.55s - 20.19s |  for that, so, uh, the reason I, I proposed this panel is, uh, 2024 is the 40th anniversary
20.19s - 24.19s |  of a lot of sort of like benchmarks in the computer underground and the hacking thing,
24.19s - 28.91s |  so it's, it's, 1984 is when Cult of the Dead Cow was founded, it's when 2600 Magazine
28.91s - 34.83s |  was founded, it's when the Legion of Doom was founded, um, as well as I think, uh, Chaos
34.83s - 40.51s |  Computer Club was founded, um, so, you want to do something to kind of talk about that
40.51s - 45.43s |  early hacker history, so, you know, this panel is really gonna kind of focus on the 80s and
45.43s - 49.71s |  early 90s, cause that's when we are from, and I think it's kind of something that the
49.71s - 55.23s |  stories are, are sort of underrepresented in the history just cause, you know, that,
55.23s - 59.71s |  this is a time when it really was underground and, and sort of, it's not, you know, at that
59.71s - 65.23s |  time sort of, um, hacker was a dirty word, it was, you know, synonymous with, with criminal in
65.23s - 69.55s |  the, uh, in, in the press, et cetera. So I've tried to get together, uh, a group of people
69.55s - 74.55s |  from, um, various different groups including, uh, CDC and LOD, Eric, uh, Emanuel Goldstein of
77.59s - 84.33s |  2600, um, uh, MOD, which, you know, it's, it's pretty, pretty exciting to get, to get, to get
84.33s - 87.73s |  John Thread in here, as well as Tommy D. Catt, who's been around, and the panel will be
87.73s - 92.73s |  moderated by Professor, uh, Shire from Notre Dame, who, uh, wrote a book, uh, A History of
95.11s - 99.07s |  Fake Things on the Internet, available at fine bookstores everywhere, um, that came out in
99.07s - 104.65s |  December. Um, so I'm gonna let him take the, take the mic and do the, the proper
104.65s - 105.45s |  introductions, I guess.
105.45s - 106.51s |  Let's get, let's get everybody on stage.
106.51s - 109.61s |  Go get, come up and, take, take your seats.
109.61s - 114.61s |  They're hiding in the back, I don't know what's going on here. Woo! Let's give it up for the
116.45s - 117.75s |  old school hackers!
117.75s - 128.80s |  One more seat here, and we got, there, we got three here and three there, so there's, oh, you
130.24s - 137.38s |  have seven people, I was thinking, yeah, I, I can count, counting, math.
137.38s - 143.12s |  Alright, let's jump into this. Um, welcome everybody, I think DeathVeggie did a phenomenal
143.14s - 149.78s |  job introducing what this panel is all about, uh, I'm sorry to interrupt, so your talk is not
149.78s - 150.48s |  on the monitor.
150.48s - 150.92s |  Uh oh.
150.92s - 151.62s |  Oh no.
151.62s - 152.82s |  And we wanna fix that.
152.82s - 153.62s |  Okay.
153.62s - 157.06s |  The tech, the tech support crew is gonna pause us.
157.06s - 158.26s |  Talk amongst yourselves.
158.26s - 159.22s |  Yeah.
159.22s - 160.46s |  I can give you a topic.
160.46s - 161.80s |  Take a break.
161.80s - 166.94s |  You know, the, the late Byzantine Empire, how, how much of the, you know, the late Roman
166.94s - 170.10s |  Empire did it carry over and how, versus how much of the Greek, so, so please, you know,
170.10s - 176.12s |  speak amongst yourselves.
176.14s - 177.58s |  It's like a commercial break.
177.58s - 178.74s |  A commercial break, yeah.
178.74s - 179.74s |  What are we advertising?
179.74s - 181.58s |  I don't know, network didn't tell us.
181.58s - 183.28s |  Probably ham.
183.28s - 188.29s |  Just delicious ham, it's made of pigs.
188.29s - 191.43s |  Spam, spam, spam.
191.43s - 194.53s |  I'm gonna tell them you, the real AV techs might be on the stage.
194.53s - 196.93s |  Uh, we're still, they're still sorting out the AV stuff.
196.93s - 198.43s |  What do you mean the real AV techs?
198.43s - 204.57s |  Uh, they're antivirus techs, they come from CrowdStrike.
204.65s - 210.53s |  A question, um, how vetted are these people?
210.53s - 219.24s |  There's a reason that we didn't bring our laptops.
219.24s - 224.28s |  I mean, we could do, well, I guess there's, there's, there's, uh, media to go around with
224.28s - 225.28s |  our introductions.
225.28s - 226.28s |  Um.
226.28s - 228.16s |  Is this going to be on the blooper reel or is this going to be on the.
228.16s - 229.16s |  I don't know.
229.16s - 231.00s |  I mean, maybe we should jump into the other stuff while they're still sorting that out
231.00s - 232.76s |  just because we've only got a limited amount of time.
232.76s - 233.76s |  Yeah, yeah.
233.76s - 235.40s |  We don't want to, yeah, let's, let's get into this.
235.40s - 236.40s |  Woo.
236.40s - 237.40s |  Let's do it.
237.40s - 238.40s |  Okay.
238.60s - 239.60s |  Yeah.
239.60s - 240.60s |  Yeah.
240.60s - 241.60s |  The stimulating conversations about the Byzantine Empire.
241.60s - 242.60s |  You can take that.
242.60s - 243.60s |  Maybe there's going to be a breakout room afterwards.
243.60s - 244.60s |  All right.
244.60s - 245.60s |  Hello everybody.
245.60s - 250.44s |  I am Walter Shire, a professor at the University of Notre Dame, um, and I have a really fun
250.44s - 254.08s |  job because I get to hang out with hackers.
254.08s - 258.96s |  I get to study the history of hacking, which is a fascinating topic and I think we're all
258.96s - 261.92s |  here because we want to learn something about it.
261.92s - 262.92s |  Yes.
262.92s - 263.92s |  There we go.
263.92s - 264.92s |  Got it.
264.92s - 265.92s |  Woo.
265.92s - 266.92s |  We got the AV working right here.
266.92s - 267.92s |  Yeah.
268.44s - 269.44s |  No, no.
269.44s - 270.44s |  It's just on.
270.44s - 271.44s |  I know.
271.44s - 272.44s |  It's on his screen.
272.44s - 273.44s |  Woo.
273.44s - 274.44s |  Okay.
274.44s - 275.44s |  Everybody brought their opera glasses, right?
275.44s - 276.44s |  All right.
276.44s - 277.44s |  Wow.
277.44s - 278.44s |  All right.
278.44s - 279.44s |  We're just going to keep going because this could take the rest of the panel, uh, to debug.
279.44s - 286.28s |  Um, a big part of my life as a technologist has been inspired by the six folks who are
286.28s - 292.16s |  up on this stage, uh, and I thought it would be really fun to just be in conversation with
292.16s - 297.20s |  them, uh, to try to understand where all this came from, how it has brought us here to this
297.20s - 302.72s |  moment at Defcon and probably our private lives, our professional careers, social lives,
302.72s - 303.72s |  right?
303.72s - 304.72s |  Is, is all wrapped up in hacking, right?
304.72s - 305.84s |  We'd love this stuff.
305.84s - 307.20s |  And where is it all going?
307.20s - 312.76s |  Can the past really help us understand where technology is going and perhaps fix a lot
312.76s - 317.56s |  of the annoying problems out there on the internet, uh, that we're all sort of concerned
317.56s - 318.56s |  about.
318.56s - 322.72s |  So I think it's gonna be a really fun panel and to begin, let's just jump in and do our
322.72s - 323.72s |  introduction.
323.72s - 326.76s |  So I'm going to start all the way here on my left with X.
326.84s - 329.96s |  So everybody, just, I want to know your origin story, right?
329.96s - 334.36s |  Let the audience know how you got into this, um, and where is it gone in your own life?
334.36s - 336.04s |  Is the mic good?
336.04s - 337.04s |  Yeah.
337.04s - 338.04s |  Alright.
338.04s - 344.00s |  Um, so I was from, I'm from Oak Ridge, Tennessee, uh, in East Tennessee that's, there was a
344.00s - 349.36s |  city created to basically do the nuclear testing that, to build the atomic bomb.
349.36s - 354.44s |  So the city was created, there was three or four, there's a national lab, uh, three or
354.44s - 361.76s |  four other labs and my father was a, uh, computer technician at one of the national
361.76s - 363.72s |  security complexes.
363.72s - 369.08s |  So most of the city, uh, everybody I grew up with, their, their parents were in, in
369.08s - 370.08s |  the government.
370.08s - 371.08s |  Got it.
371.08s - 372.08s |  Got it.
372.08s - 373.08s |  Yes.
373.08s - 374.08s |  Excellent.
374.08s - 375.08s |  Woo.
375.08s - 376.08s |  Thank you.
376.08s - 377.08s |  Thank you very much.
377.08s - 378.08s |  I don't know what's on the screen.
378.08s - 379.08s |  To everybody who's endeavored.
379.08s - 380.08s |  Yeah.
380.08s - 383.00s |  So everybody I grew up with, their, their parents were working for the national security
383.00s - 385.80s |  complexes, um, the national lab.
385.80s - 389.72s |  So everybody, there was a lot of smart people that I grew up with in high school.
389.72s - 393.40s |  So, um, my dad brought home a computer in 1985.
393.40s - 394.40s |  It was a compact luggable.
394.40s - 399.16s |  It was about 30 pounds with the, the tiny little seven inch screen and the fold out
399.16s - 400.16s |  keyboard.
400.16s - 401.16s |  I still have it in my attic.
401.16s - 402.16s |  Uh, it does not work.
402.16s - 406.96s |  It needs a new power supply, um, two floppy disks, no hard drive.
406.96s - 413.36s |  Um, so my dad brought it home with a Hayes 1200 bod smart mode and maybe so he could
413.36s - 418.56s |  do non non-security work at home, non non-confidential work at home.
418.56s - 421.28s |  Um, so he, he did give me access to it.
421.28s - 424.44s |  I, I didn't know what to do with the modem.
424.44s - 429.08s |  You know, he taught me basic, uh, so I would play games and, you know, control break out
429.08s - 430.52s |  of the finest language.
430.52s - 431.52s |  Yeah.
431.52s - 435.80s |  You can control break out of games to see what the code is doing.
435.80s - 441.48s |  Um, that's almost the extent of my programming, uh, ability.
441.48s - 447.48s |  But um, so before I was old enough to drive, I used to ride my bike down to radio shack,
447.48s - 451.84s |  which was a couple of blocks away and just hang out at radio shack with a couple of older
451.84s - 456.24s |  guys who were computer guys into the bulletin board scene and stuff.
456.24s - 459.36s |  And so they finally probably got annoyed with me being there.
459.52s - 461.80s |  Um, they gave, they gave me a number to call.
461.80s - 464.80s |  I called and got into the bulletin board scene.
464.80s - 468.96s |  Um, I was in love with the idea of being a hacker after seeing war games.
468.96s - 472.96s |  Um, but I, I had no, no, no way to get there.
472.96s - 476.32s |  Um, I'll make it a little bit shorter.
476.32s - 481.40s |  I finally found a bulletin board where I was on enough that somebody gave me access to
481.40s - 485.48s |  the secret section codes and wares, uh, mostly wares.
485.48s - 488.96s |  But um, there were frack magazine copies in there.
488.96s - 493.16s |  And once I started reading those, I was, I was in love with the idea of, I wanted to
493.16s - 494.16s |  be this.
494.16s - 495.16s |  I wanted to be a hacker.
495.16s - 499.60s |  I wanted to, uh, to, to learn what they were talking about.
499.60s - 503.60s |  Um, how much time are we getting for the introductions?
503.60s - 504.60s |  Keep going.
504.60s - 505.60s |  Keep going.
505.60s - 506.60s |  Okay.
506.60s - 512.20s |  So, uh, then, you know, graduated high school, I, uh, started college at the university of
512.20s - 515.96s |  Tennessee in Chattanooga where I got my first Unix account.
515.96s - 521.80s |  They gave all the students Unix accounts, um, for email.
521.80s - 527.16s |  Um, and from reading and seeing what people were doing, I saw that several people were
527.16s - 528.52s |  using IRC.
528.52s - 533.84s |  I got on IRC, I joined pound wares because I was, I was in, I wanted to play games for
533.84s - 534.84s |  free basically.
534.84s - 538.44s |  I, Tommy D. Cat was on there.
538.44s - 541.04s |  Um, uh, uh, who is of him?
541.04s - 546.44s |  He was on pound hack, joined pound hack and met, uh, some of the best friends I've had
546.44s - 547.44s |  in my life.
547.44s - 548.44s |  Thanks.
548.44s - 557.35s |  Before you go, I want to ask, like, uh, I would like to take a picture of the crowd.
557.35s - 558.35s |  So I'm going to do that.
558.35s - 563.79s |  And anybody who doesn't, you know, who doesn't wear your face, like blur your face just live.
563.79s - 564.79s |  So thank you very much.
564.79s - 570.07s |  I'm going to take one from this side and one from that side.
570.07s - 571.07s |  Thank you.
571.07s - 572.07s |  All right.
573.07s - 574.07s |  All right.
574.07s - 576.07s |  Manuel, you're up next.
576.07s - 584.43s |  Hey, um, well, I'm a manual Goldstein, um, a pen name that I coined 40 years ago, 1984,
584.43s - 586.87s |  a name that's from the book, 1984.
586.87s - 590.71s |  There's a lot of synchronicity here that kind of scares me actually, because I don't understand
590.71s - 591.71s |  how it all happened.
591.71s - 598.63s |  So, so, um, um, in, in tune, um, but yeah, 1984 was when a manual Goldstein technically
598.63s - 600.95s |  was born as a handle.
600.95s - 606.07s |  Um, but my, um, interest in technology started, I, well, I mean, I've always been interested
606.07s - 611.83s |  in technology, however limited I had access to grew up in a one parent household.
611.83s - 616.59s |  We never had much, but you know, we had a phone and I would play around with the phone
616.59s - 617.59s |  all the time.
617.59s - 619.39s |  Rotary dial phone.
619.39s - 620.71s |  People know what rotary dial phones are.
620.71s - 621.71s |  Okay.
621.71s - 622.71s |  Good.
622.71s - 623.71s |  Okay.
623.71s - 624.71s |  Sometimes I talk to crowds and they have no idea what I'm talking about.
624.71s - 629.31s |  Um, if you ever want to have some fun, get some teenagers, tell them to dial a number
629.31s - 630.31s |  on a rotary phone.
630.67s - 634.07s |  They don't, they don't know how to, how far they supposed to go with their finger.
634.07s - 636.63s |  They don't know if they're supposed to push it, they don't know if it's supposed to lift
636.63s - 637.63s |  up the receiver.
637.63s - 638.87s |  It's, it's a lot of fun.
638.87s - 646.39s |  Um, but yeah, so that was my, um, the extent of my, um, uh, access to technology until
646.39s - 652.11s |  my senior year of high school, when I heard this, this sound coming from this room, uh,
652.11s - 657.87s |  that had computer class in it, um, somebody was strangling a dolphin.
657.95s - 661.27s |  Well, it was just a weird, like kind of high pitched noise.
661.27s - 667.67s |  Turned out it was, um, uh, deck riders, uh, 300 bar deck riders, high speed deck riders.
667.67s - 673.07s |  Um, they were connected to, um, uh, a computer system that the entire school district was
673.07s - 674.59s |  connected to far away.
674.59s - 678.23s |  Uh, and all these people were typing away and I was fascinated by it, you know, that
678.23s - 680.87s |  you could type something and something would type back at you.
680.87s - 681.99s |  Uh, that was new.
681.99s - 683.99s |  That was, that was alien.
683.99s - 689.27s |  And, uh, my high school, Ward Melville High School in Setauket, New York, um, we had these
689.27s - 691.27s |  deck riders that other school districts didn't have.
691.27s - 694.19s |  They had shitty 110 baud connections.
694.19s - 695.83s |  We had the 300 baud connection.
695.83s - 699.95s |  Um, and so, you know, I just got more and more interested in that and, uh, started playing
699.95s - 700.95s |  around and never took a course.
700.95s - 705.47s |  To this day, I still have never taken a computer course, um, and which is weird.
705.47s - 710.35s |  Um, but, um, basically, uh, I'd stay after school and that's when the games would open
710.35s - 711.35s |  up.
711.35s - 714.47s |  You know, Star Trek and One Piece and all kinds of fun things like that.
714.47s - 719.15s |  Um, and, uh, basically that led to my interest in college.
719.15s - 723.67s |  Went to the State University of New York at Stony Brook, uh, and, um, well, I can tell
723.67s - 727.67s |  the story later about how I got the FBI to raid them, but that's, that's, that's gonna
727.67s - 729.39s |  take longer than a couple of minutes.
729.39s - 734.19s |  But basically, um, uh, Stony Brook was a place where I was able to, um, uh, meet like-minded
734.19s - 739.51s |  people, uh, expand, uh, my mind in, in many ways.
739.67s - 744.75s |  Uh, but mostly in, in just learning and being exposed to different, uh, perspectives.
744.75s - 749.03s |  Um, and I was an English major in a school that's mostly known for engineering.
749.03s - 751.51s |  Uh, so that kind of set me apart.
751.51s - 756.63s |  I like to write, I like to, um, uh, collate, worked for the, uh, campus, two campus newspapers.
756.63s - 763.35s |  Um, but it was the BBS scene, um, when, um, I had access to a modem.
763.35s - 765.91s |  Um, well, I should, I should explain.
765.91s - 767.47s |  I worked for the campus radio station.
767.47s - 774.15s |  Our chief engineer bought an H89, Heathcote H89, uh, and, um, we used that to connect
774.15s - 775.39s |  to BBSs.
775.39s - 780.43s |  And I found those to be fascinating, uh, bulletin board systems where these, these methods of
780.43s - 785.87s |  just connecting to people all throughout the country, uh, you could only have one person
785.87s - 786.87s |  on at a time.
786.87s - 790.95s |  So most of the time it was dealing with busy signals and waiting for them to go away so
790.95s - 791.95s |  you could connect.
791.95s - 794.35s |  And I think we were up to 1,200 bought at that time.
794.35s - 798.43s |  Uh, and by connecting to all these different bulletin boards, I was able to make friends
798.43s - 799.67s |  all over the place.
799.67s - 804.07s |  Um, how I was able to connect to long distance ones is also a different story.
804.07s - 809.47s |  Um, but basically I, the, the hacker and, and, and freak, phone freak bulletin boards
809.47s - 812.67s |  had these great stories, amazing stories.
812.67s - 814.63s |  Um, and I wanted to share those stories.
814.63s - 818.83s |  I wanted other people to read them because they were just so amazing about people going
818.83s - 824.11s |  to their central office to trash and get printouts and log in to the Cosmos system
824.11s - 830.63s |  and, and, and just all kinds of hacker adventures that I just knew the public would appreciate
830.63s - 832.79s |  if presented in, in the right manner.
832.79s - 837.51s |  Because believe it or not, back then in the early to mid eighties, hackers were being
837.51s - 838.51s |  demonized.
838.51s - 839.51s |  Yeah.
839.51s - 840.51s |  Imagine that.
840.51s - 846.99s |  Um, so people had a, a misconception and I figured all they had to do was hear some stories
847.15s - 850.67s |  and maybe they would, they would see another, um, uh, aspect to them.
850.67s - 854.87s |  Well, obviously that didn't happen, uh, but we did get a whole lot more hackers, a whole
854.87s - 858.39s |  lot more people that wanted in on this, on this magical world.
858.39s - 861.99s |  Uh, that's basically how the idea for 2600 got started.
861.99s - 866.19s |  Uh, what if we print this out and, and, and mail it to people?
866.19s - 867.59s |  Let's see if that works.
867.59s - 875.19s |  And basically, uh, we posted some, some, um, um, uh, I guess, uh, files, uh, G files or,
875.39s - 880.39s |  um, announcements on bulletin boards, um, send us an envelope and we'll send you an,
880.39s - 883.99s |  uh, an issue of a magazine in January of 1984.
883.99s - 888.39s |  And that's how the first issue went out to a bunch of people that just sent us an envelope.
888.39s - 901.44s |  Uh, and, um, uh, the rest is pretty much history, but that's how it started.
901.44s - 905.88s |  I think, uh, you know, I started out, um, kind of similar to, to X in some ways, but
905.88s - 909.24s |  although earlier, uh, you know, I had a dad that had worked at the computer industry,
909.44s - 912.72s |  uh, and a mom who had been, you know, working in a computer lab in the seventies.
912.72s - 915.92s |  And as a kid, I remember, you know, going and playing at the computer lab and with the,
915.92s - 917.00s |  with the punch cards and stuff.
917.00s - 920.88s |  But, you know, we got a computer in 1980, like a, uh, my dad built one from a kit, a
920.88s - 926.40s |  Sinclair ZX 80 and similar to X, like, you know, I was, uh, working in basic typing and
926.40s - 930.52s |  stuff like that anyway, fast forward to like kind of the mid eighties, my dad brought home
930.52s - 933.84s |  a modem, you know, I wasn't really doing anything with it at that time.
933.84s - 937.32s |  Maybe calling a couple, you know, uh, my friend's local board.
937.80s - 944.72s |  Um, in 1986, uh, my family went on a vacation to, uh, California to, I grew up outside of
944.72s - 950.40s |  Boston, um, and, uh, to visit my cousins who were in Silicon Valley.
950.68s - 954.00s |  And they, they sent me home with a, with a floppy disk that was full of text files.
954.00s - 955.00s |  So it's 1986.
955.00s - 958.92s |  This, this, uh, disk had cult of the dead cow files on it.
958.92s - 961.36s |  It had frack magazine, number three.
961.60s - 965.24s |  It had files from a group called, um, anarchy Inc.
965.32s - 969.68s |  It had, um, I think, uh, one of the LOD technical journals, et cetera.
970.08s - 973.52s |  And it sort of was like, Oh man, there's this, all this other cool stuff going out
973.52s - 973.64s |  there.
973.64s - 975.32s |  And I started to call other BBSs.
975.84s - 978.08s |  Um, you know, they would have a list of numbers at the bottom.
978.08s - 981.40s |  So I'd start calling BBSs in other parts of the country, talking to people.
981.76s - 986.12s |  And I realized that, you know, I had, I was growing up in like this, like a relatively
986.12s - 991.12s |  small, relatively conservative town in the outskirts of Boston where I was the weird
991.12s - 991.44s |  kid.
991.88s - 995.00s |  And like, so being on BBS is like, Oh, holy shit.
995.00s - 996.60s |  There are other people like me out there.
997.00s - 1000.28s |  And it's what, you know, my grandmother used to affectionately refer to as smarty
1000.28s - 1000.80s |  weirdos.
1000.84s - 1002.72s |  She's like, you and your friends are smarty weirdos.
1003.12s - 1004.92s |  It's like, which I think is fair.
1004.92s - 1012.44s |  You know, she didn't have the language for neuro atypical, but, um, so, uh, you
1012.44s - 1015.12s |  know, I called these things, meeting people all over and learning stuff.
1015.12s - 1018.48s |  And then there was the day that my parents got a $600 phone bill.
1019.08s - 1024.00s |  And, um, yeah, they sat me down and my dad was like, this will not happen again.
1024.32s - 1027.68s |  I was like, okay, well, I'm not going to stop talking to my friends in Sweden.
1028.00s - 1030.08s |  So, uh, how do I do this for free?
1030.12s - 1033.12s |  And, you know, so that led into like learning how to make, you know, phone,
1033.16s - 1037.20s |  phone calls for free, either, you know, uh, war dialing, uh, sorry, codes or
1037.20s - 1038.68s |  wardrobe dialing locally.
1039.08s - 1042.80s |  And I love to find what we call the global out dial modems, which was basically
1042.80s - 1046.24s |  businesses for their own people would have like, okay, you dial in a local number.
1046.48s - 1048.52s |  Then there's just a modem that will allow you to call anywhere.
1048.76s - 1051.08s |  And a lot of times he's had no security on them at all.
1051.08s - 1055.04s |  Cause there wasn't really a concept of that at the time, or it was just like a
1055.04s - 1056.32s |  default password or something like that.
1056.32s - 1058.96s |  So then I could call whatever I want with no, never get a bill.
1059.44s - 1064.28s |  Um, In the, you know, I also started working with, uh, you know, talking to
1064.28s - 1067.60s |  other people like into the culture that had cow, I was eventually invited in
1067.60s - 1071.88s |  cause I was, uh, um, setting up, uh, Alliance teleconferences, which were.
1072.88s - 1077.16s |  Just, it was teleconferencing, but at that time teleconferencing cost
1077.16s - 1078.68s |  like multiple dollars a minute.
1078.80s - 1081.88s |  Like, and so, so I was just setting these up for free on hacked accounts.
1081.96s - 1082.28s |  Sorry.
1082.28s - 1085.60s |  I mean, allegedly setting these up for free on allegedly hacked
1085.60s - 1086.60s |  account in 40 years, man.
1088.32s - 1095.84s |  Um, and, uh, eventually they, uh, invited me to join and I guess, you know, somehow
1095.84s - 1097.52s |  that was over 30 years ago.
1097.72s - 1099.00s |  Time is fucking weird.
1099.56s - 1101.08s |  Um, but yeah, I don't know.
1101.20s - 1108.78s |  So Patrick,
1111.86s - 1118.46s |  my, uh, my, my introduction to computers sort of happened in the late seventies.
1118.46s - 1122.82s |  My father was a physicist who was working at the national center for atmospheric
1122.82s - 1127.42s |  research, and they had one of the first craze super computers.
1127.42s - 1130.70s |  And, uh, back then it was really exciting.
1130.70s - 1133.98s |  It had its own room, this cooling system all around it.
1134.74s - 1137.74s |  Kind of like an orange hexagon shaped tower.
1137.74s - 1142.70s |  And, uh, my, my father, uh, taught me to program this incredible language
1142.70s - 1152.62s |  called Fortran 77 that you'd feed it on punch cards and, uh, that, that led
1152.62s - 1158.30s |  subsequently to, to me getting an Apple two, no plus, and you could get the 16
1158.30s - 1161.82s |  K Ram card and get, you know, solder in a shift key mod.
1161.82s - 1163.46s |  So you had lowercase on it.
1163.50s - 1166.82s |  And, uh, you know, it was amazing stuff.
1166.82s - 1172.30s |  And then, uh, after that was, I think came out with a 5.25 inch disk drive.
1172.30s - 1175.38s |  So you didn't have to use cassette tape anymore to sort of things.
1176.18s - 1181.06s |  And in the very beginning, uh, there were like these different gatherings
1181.10s - 1190.46s |  of Norway, typical individuals who had gathered together to play with computers.
1190.46s - 1196.06s |  And, uh, it was in person and that eventually led to, uh, being online and
1196.06s - 1197.94s |  coming in contact with more people.
1197.94s - 1203.46s |  And there was the piracy scene of getting software because it's like, well, I'm,
1203.50s - 1207.90s |  I'm a kid, I don't have like all this crazy money to buy this software.
1207.90s - 1209.10s |  I'm not really going to use.
1209.86s - 1216.62s |  And what it turned into was the most interesting thing about 99% of all
1216.66s - 1218.90s |  software other than collecting it.
1218.90s - 1224.06s |  Cause she got them all is very important, especially if they're zero day old wares.
1224.82s - 1228.94s |  Um, but it was just like the protection scheme.
1228.98s - 1233.50s |  What did you guys do and pour into this to try to prevent people from copying it?
1233.54s - 1239.54s |  And then all of that went online with modems at the lightning fast speed of
1239.54s - 1245.38s |  like 300 Baud, which, uh, you know, increased exponentially and as has been
1245.38s - 1252.10s |  mentioned, I got like, my mom got her first like $2,000 phone bill and it's
1252.10s - 1258.70s |  just put the fuck is this like, well, I'm not going to stop calling my
1258.70s - 1260.50s |  friends all over the world.
1260.86s - 1264.06s |  So how does the phone system work exactly?
1264.06s - 1266.06s |  And how are all these things connected?
1266.06s - 1269.18s |  Which led to an interest in, in freaking.
1269.18s - 1273.62s |  And by that time, uh, I was living in New York city, hanging out in the Lower East
1273.62s - 1274.14s |  side.
1274.14s - 1278.78s |  And, uh, there was this thing called youth international party lines, which was
1278.78s - 1282.58s |  actually started by, uh, you know, one of the people was Abby Hoffman.
1282.58s - 1284.90s |  It was the whole countercultural movement.
1284.90s - 1286.94s |  It was left of the left back then.
1287.42s - 1292.02s |  And, uh, it metamorphosed into tap and there were the tap meetings on the Lower
1292.02s - 1292.74s |  East side.
1293.26s - 1299.38s |  And, uh, we got together and do a lot of interesting things with, uh, the phone
1299.38s - 1303.50s |  company computers because they really had a fascinating network.
1303.50s - 1307.58s |  I mean, cosmos is, you know, Unix and uppercase, and it has a lot of
1307.58s - 1310.66s |  undocumented commands that you're not supposed to know about.
1311.62s - 1317.82s |  And, uh, that whole culture of being online and connecting with people, uh,
1317.82s - 1321.62s |  sort of led to the formation of these groups who would work together.
1322.10s - 1327.74s |  And that, that was the beginning of, uh, well, LOD, uh, there was a previous
1327.74s - 1333.10s |  group called nights of shadow that kind of self-destructed and, uh, there,
1333.10s - 1337.78s |  there's this person who may even be here somewhere at this conference.
1337.78s - 1341.22s |  I don't know who, who, who's the founder of the legion of doom.
1341.82s - 1351.26s |  And, uh, we, we, we basically, we basically, you got together people who
1351.26s - 1353.34s |  were good at different skill sets.
1353.34s - 1356.66s |  There was the people who were good with the phone systems, people who are good
1356.66s - 1361.42s |  at hacking and actual coding and programming and the social engineers.
1361.74s - 1366.66s |  And together you would all pull your talents together to cause greater
1366.66s - 1368.62s |  chaos than you could buy yourself.
1371.14s - 1379.06s |  So that, that was, uh, you know, the eighties into the very early nineties
1379.06s - 1385.18s |  where, uh, my, my friend and, uh, another person from LOD, uh, Bruce
1385.18s - 1391.30s |  Fancher and I started Mindvox and Mindvox was the first internet
1391.30s - 1393.54s |  access provider in New York city.
1394.02s - 1397.62s |  This was, uh, we started the company in 1991.
1397.66s - 1403.90s |  We went live in 1992 and suddenly everybody on earth had to get on
1403.90s - 1405.46s |  this thing called the internet.
1406.70s - 1410.42s |  That was, uh, it was a tremendous amount of fun.
1410.46s - 1412.34s |  It was complete chaos.
1412.42s - 1418.86s |  And I'm very grateful to have, uh, lived through, uh, this timeline that most of
1418.86s - 1420.74s |  us sitting here right now share.
1421.14s - 1422.34s |  Thank you very much.
1428.62s - 1430.30s |  Tommy DeCatt, you are up next.
1430.54s - 1430.90s |  Yeah.
1431.14s - 1432.26s |  Hello, Defcon.
1432.86s - 1436.26s |  Hey, been coming here for a while.
1436.30s - 1438.42s |  Uh, let me, uh, give you a little background.
1438.42s - 1442.58s |  Does it, uh, it's not too different from a couple of the, the people over there.
1442.58s - 1447.34s |  I guess, uh, Walter, he kind of described us as the new wave coming into the scene.
1447.78s - 1455.30s |  Um, 1983, I was 13 years old and, uh, I had a Commodore 64 at that time.
1455.30s - 1458.26s |  I kind of liked games, uh, and my dad got a modem.
1458.82s - 1462.42s |  So the problem was that modem wasn't for a Commodore 64.
1462.46s - 1464.46s |  It was for a CPM based system.
1464.46s - 1471.42s |  So basically I needed to, to learn how to control that modem in a, in, in, in
1472.18s - 1476.42s |  basically on the CDN CPN system, I had to reverse engineer the drivers on
1476.46s - 1478.46s |  that to, to write my own bulletin board software.
1478.46s - 1481.42s |  So I could get people to call me to get me where it's right.
1481.86s - 1485.74s |  Um, eventually I did get, get a modem for that Commodore 64.
1486.02s - 1489.58s |  Um, but also, you know, I wanted more games for that.
1489.58s - 1494.98s |  So what I found the, the, the currency for getting games, uh, you could get codes too.
1494.98s - 1498.30s |  You could, uh, you could call long distance for free.
1498.30s - 1500.22s |  There's all kinds of neat things you could get to.
1500.22s - 1505.66s |  So I kind of discovered the world of, uh, freaking, I guess, uh, you could
1505.66s - 1512.78s |  call me a co kitty at that point for, uh, whatnot, but, uh, you know, as, as I
1512.78s - 1517.62s |  started learning about, uh, access to things, you know, that, that became kind
1517.62s - 1522.98s |  of addicting, uh, there were toys out there that I wanted to get into, there
1522.98s - 1527.18s |  were games out there, but mostly I started learning about other computers,
1527.18s - 1532.42s |  other systems, and it just kind of started, uh, creating a bit of a thirst
1532.42s - 1533.02s |  for knowledge.
1533.02s - 1539.66s |  So, uh, a lot of the things we did back in the day, I would say is, is, uh,
1539.66s - 1541.78s |  Gear Dad getting access to these things.
1541.78s - 1545.02s |  I mean, I'm wearing this little thing that, uh, you know, emulates a system
1545.02s - 1549.70s |  that came out in 2001 that plays games so much cooler than, you know, all the,
1549.70s - 1553.58s |  the hoops I, I jumped through to get the games for the system I had at that time.
1554.02s - 1559.46s |  But, uh, as, as, you know, reaching out and, and, uh, finding people out there
1559.50s - 1563.58s |  kind of similar to me, I discovered there were communities or, you know, you
1563.58s - 1565.10s |  didn't have to go at this alone.
1565.50s - 1570.90s |  So, uh, reaching out to the, the bulletin board systems in the area, uh, I
1570.90s - 1575.38s |  discovered, I think it was a metal shop, uh, was one of the first metal shop AE.
1575.38s - 1575.58s |  Yeah.
1575.58s - 1579.14s |  One of the first, uh, big boards I got into and started learning about the scene
1579.14s - 1583.22s |  and that's where I learned, uh, a lot of those, uh, kids met up, uh, at this
1583.22s - 1583.62s |  place.
1583.62s - 1589.22s |  Uh, I, I lived in Midwest at the time and there's a, a Galleria mall in St.
1589.22s - 1592.46s |  Louis that they had what they call 2,600 meetings.
1592.46s - 1597.10s |  So I started showing up there, met some like-minded folks, traded games and
1597.10s - 1600.06s |  whatnot, and they started telling me, well, you know, this is actually about
1600.06s - 1600.82s |  this magazine.
1601.22s - 1606.54s |  So that's kind of where I saw, uh, Emmanuel's work, uh, come in, in there
1606.54s - 1611.30s |  and that, that started lighting a path, you know, so it's all about the access.
1611.30s - 1614.78s |  And I started reading about other people who did things, you know, maybe it's not
1614.78s - 1620.98s |  the most exquisite stuff, uh, or hacks, but people are showing that they're
1621.74s - 1623.02s |  curious about things.
1623.54s - 1626.18s |  So that really engaged my interest.
1626.22s - 1632.86s |  Uh, I started, uh, talking to, uh, there's a, a guy Sigmund, uh, who had,
1632.86s - 1635.30s |  uh, Rosetta news was a bookstore.
1635.30s - 1638.22s |  And he said, you know, if you like that magazine, maybe you'll want to take a
1638.22s - 1642.38s |  look, look at this, uh, 411 blacklisted, take a look at those things.
1642.42s - 1646.38s |  And it started, you know, expanding my mind, reaching out to other things.
1646.38s - 1649.02s |  And there are other communities out there too.
1649.34s - 1655.34s |  Um, where the, the BBS scene is, uh, uh, originally like the, the, the
1655.34s - 1660.18s |  wares and, uh, whatnot, people were really private, but there's some other
1660.18s - 1663.82s |  groups that really started reaching out socially and connecting.
1664.22s - 1670.26s |  Um, I saw, uh, I guess, uh, you know, talking about links you find on a
1670.26s - 1674.50s |  bulletin boards to other boards around the system, requiring access to get out
1674.50s - 1678.62s |  their codes, uh, figuring out how to freak blue boxing, whatever techniques
1678.62s - 1680.42s |  you need to, to, to reach out there.
1680.70s - 1683.70s |  But their, their communities are building around that time in the mid
1683.70s - 1685.34s |  eighties, uh, early eighties.
1685.62s - 1688.62s |  Uh, there's mind mocks there, there's the well and whatnot.
1688.90s - 1692.50s |  Uh, there's a system called the versatile, uh, where somebody take an
1692.50s - 1695.54s |  Apple to computer and just load it up with modems, but those people
1695.54s - 1696.74s |  could talk to each other.
1697.18s - 1703.30s |  Uh, that started building up into, to other, uh, interconnected systems.
1703.58s - 1709.70s |  I think bitnets, uh, was the, the first real major interconnected network, uh,
1709.70s - 1713.42s |  other than, you know, like, uh, telling it or whatever that was for a research
1713.42s - 1718.50s |  purpose, but they had a, a, a chat program on there where if you had an
1718.50s - 1724.06s |  account on a bitnet computer, you could tell relay at like CUNY VM or some
1724.06s - 1728.42s |  other, uh, system that had a relay host on it and it would connect you with
1728.42s - 1730.34s |  other people that were trying to talk to relay.
1730.38s - 1735.30s |  That was the first real chat system I saw on a, on a network system.
1735.86s - 1741.82s |  And then in 1989, Yarkel or can there, or, or I can't pronounce the name.
1741.82s - 1742.26s |  I'm sorry.
1742.50s - 1748.26s |  Um, invented IRC and that was internet relay chat.
1748.26s - 1752.38s |  That was based on the, the bitnet, uh, client that came before that.
1752.38s - 1755.18s |  So I, I found that really interesting.
1755.98s - 1762.50s |  Um, reaching out, talking to people, uh, first joined up plus wares, I believe,
1762.54s - 1769.10s |  uh, in 1989 and, uh, the channels at that time had a plus, not a pound symbol
1769.10s - 1771.62s |  in front of them for, you know, whatever reason there, there've been
1771.62s - 1773.38s |  iterations over, uh, the years.
1773.82s - 1780.94s |  But, uh, yeah, the first person I, I saw on IRC in November, 1989, I think was
1780.94s - 1786.02s |  guns, uh, guns was a girl from the university of Illinois, uh, Champaign
1786.02s - 1790.38s |  Urbana, and just a, a, a little shout out for that.
1790.66s - 1794.90s |  Um, shortly after that, so yeah, I met a girl first thing on it.
1797.90s - 1798.22s |  Yeah.
1798.38s - 1802.74s |  Shortly after that, you know, look at plus hack, uh, saw some people on there,
1802.74s - 1806.46s |  but, uh, mostly with IRC, I saw there's a opportunity to kind of
1806.46s - 1808.02s |  rebrand myself a little bit too.
1808.50s - 1812.10s |  If you put in a nickname, you're limited to nine characters and that didn't
1812.10s - 1815.58s |  really fit the, the nicknames that are, you know, still undisclosed to this
1815.58s - 1818.22s |  day of, of what I used before that point.
1818.22s - 1820.02s |  But, you know, I kind of rebranded myself.
1820.02s - 1822.94s |  He was like, I'm not necessarily a wares dude anymore.
1823.14s - 1824.10s |  I'm just a script kiddie.
1824.10s - 1824.82s |  That's a lot better.
1825.18s - 1831.34s |  Um, but what I, I saw is there's a currency, uh, between wares and hack.
1831.66s - 1832.78s |  You could take those codes.
1832.78s - 1836.58s |  You could take those wares, take those techniques to get into systems and
1836.62s - 1839.54s |  you could kind of enable the communities between.
1839.54s - 1844.02s |  So, uh, one of the things I did in the early nineties, I guess, is kind of
1844.34s - 1847.02s |  start creating that bridge between communities.
1847.42s - 1854.54s |  Um, and I did that by, uh, creating a couple of bots that set on those channels.
1854.90s - 1856.86s |  Uh, there's hat cat and where's cat.
1857.70s - 1861.42s |  And basically they maintain the peace through, uh, violence.
1861.70s - 1869.22s |  So, um, the, but the, what that did is it set me in a position where, uh, IRC
1869.22s - 1871.50s |  was kind of where everybody was popping up.
1871.50s - 1875.50s |  Anybody was, anybody would try to pop up in that area and I would see them come up.
1875.50s - 1880.22s |  So what was interesting is I saw a lot of people, you know, both on the stage
1880.22s - 1884.46s |  and in this room, you know, literally grow up through, through IRC.
1884.46s - 1886.14s |  And that was, that was kind of special.
1886.14s - 1890.98s |  And this community is really built in a way that back then I didn't really expect.
1894.22s - 1896.78s |  It's just, I look out here, it's just amazing.
1898.34s - 1898.86s |  All right.
1898.90s - 1902.10s |  And last but not least, the one and only John Threat.
1902.50s - 1903.30s |  Yo, what's up?
1904.06s - 1904.42s |  I am.
1907.14s - 1907.86s |  That's kind of you.
1907.90s - 1912.78s |  Uh, one question I have is that first of all, just before I get started, uh, yo,
1912.78s - 1916.14s |  you guys sure you weren't calling sex lines to run up those bills, man?
1916.58s - 1917.66s |  You could tell me, bro.
1919.90s - 1922.06s |  So where should I start?
1922.10s - 1922.42s |  All right.
1922.82s - 1923.62s |  What was the question?
1924.54s - 1925.98s |  What is your origin story?
1926.94s - 1928.02s |  How did you become a hacker?
1928.90s - 1929.30s |  All right.
1929.30s - 1931.02s |  So, uh, yeah.
1931.02s - 1932.90s |  So I'm from Brooklyn, Brownsville.
1932.90s - 1934.70s |  Anybody here from Brooklyn, Brownsville?
1935.98s - 1936.62s |  Oh, really?
1936.66s - 1937.54s |  It's fucking quiet.
1937.74s - 1938.10s |  All right.
1940.10s - 1941.22s |  Before we get started.
1941.50s - 1941.82s |  All right.
1941.82s - 1942.46s |  Raise your hand.
1942.46s - 1947.02s |  If you, uh, have broken into a computer before, who, yo, what's up?
1947.06s - 1947.78s |  Come on, do it.
1948.50s - 1948.94s |  Nice.
1948.94s - 1949.62s |  This is good.
1949.70s - 1951.06s |  That makes me feel at home.
1951.82s - 1952.22s |  I'm home.
1952.70s - 1953.02s |  All right.
1953.02s - 1954.90s |  So for me, I'm from Brownsville, Brooklyn.
1955.50s - 1961.42s |  Um, my mother worked at a school, uh, then, uh, yeah, they had computers there
1961.46s - 1963.26s |  and it wasn't any games or anything.
1963.26s - 1964.54s |  So I was just fucking with it.
1964.54s - 1964.90s |  Right.
1965.22s - 1967.38s |  There was like a Apple two or something.
1967.98s - 1970.06s |  And yeah, so I'll fucking with this thing.
1970.06s - 1974.78s |  And then there was a, there was this lovely woman, uh, Sheila.
1975.30s - 1980.02s |  Um, um, she lived in park slope and her and her partner, she was very cool.
1980.02s - 1983.26s |  She had like a Mohawk and said, and she was like, yo, I want you to
1983.26s - 1984.70s |  come to my house and just cold.
1985.50s - 1988.58s |  And then boom, I'd be there and she'd be like, no games, just cold.
1988.90s - 1991.74s |  And I just be there and I'd be like, I don't know if this is fun anymore,
1991.74s - 1994.82s |  but that's all I can fucking code.
1994.82s - 1995.10s |  Right.
1995.58s - 1999.66s |  So in a lot of ways, that's like the crucible for me, I was just
1999.66s - 2002.38s |  fucking coding and shit, all that shit didn't even matter.
2002.58s - 2007.54s |  So then, uh, uh, eventually I did get a computer and then I did get a modem.
2007.66s - 2011.90s |  I, you know, I, yeah, I'm not going to say how I got that motor, but yeah,
2011.94s - 2018.46s |  trust me, my mom didn't buy that modem for the Commodore 64, but for me, I
2018.46s - 2020.90s |  only know breaking into systems.
2020.90s - 2021.78s |  That's my shit.
2022.18s - 2024.50s |  That's what I do as a hacker.
2024.54s - 2027.42s |  That's like the starting point for me.
2027.58s - 2031.74s |  So initially, yo, that was all I did was just breaking computers.
2031.74s - 2034.70s |  The time I saw a pound hack, I was already breaking into computers.
2034.70s - 2036.22s |  I was like, I don't need this chat shit.
2037.86s - 2038.62s |  Just break in.
2047.10s - 2051.46s |  Uh, yeah, no, for a long time, actually on, uh, the instructions for IRG, it
2051.46s - 2053.82s |  was like how to do a, uh, a band.
2053.82s - 2055.14s |  Permaban was Netwiz.
2055.14s - 2057.42s |  That was my hacker handle at that time.
2057.46s - 2058.34s |  You were the example.
2059.50s - 2060.58s |  I mean, I tore that shit up.
2060.58s - 2063.54s |  So anyway, the, I mean, I was really bad.
2063.54s - 2068.54s |  So, um, but I think that like, for me, that was like the start.
2068.54s - 2073.10s |  I feel like I was, uh, uh, in a lot of ways, like hacking is magical.
2073.10s - 2075.82s |  One of the reasons I asked you to raise your hands is because if you've ever
2075.82s - 2080.82s |  broken into a system there, yo, to be honest, that shit is like an orgasm.
2081.26s - 2082.98s |  It's like a tingle goes up your spine.
2083.66s - 2084.90s |  It's unbelievable.
2085.34s - 2090.18s |  The feeling it's also such a creative exercise that a lot
2090.18s - 2091.22s |  of people don't realize it.
2091.22s - 2093.02s |  Now there's different ways to relate to it.
2093.18s - 2096.54s |  Some people relate to it in a technical sense and that's fine, but
2096.54s - 2098.06s |  there's also like an art to it.
2098.54s - 2102.86s |  And a beauty to it, into exploring and using your imagination as ways
2102.86s - 2104.78s |  to get around in different systems.
2105.06s - 2107.14s |  And a lot of times people don't really think about that.
2107.14s - 2109.50s |  Like for me, and maybe I'm going too far.
2109.50s - 2112.26s |  We can talk about this later, but it's the idea that actually sometimes
2112.26s - 2116.38s |  reflects in security too much where it's like, okay, efficiency, here's
2116.38s - 2121.86s |  a checklist, but the beauty of the attacker or the hacker or whatever
2121.86s - 2126.14s |  you want to call it is using your imagination in a pure form to get
2126.18s - 2129.74s |  around and look at data and not let the world restrict you.
2129.74s - 2131.02s |  You don't think about that.
2131.30s - 2135.34s |  And that was allowing me to have access to computers around the world
2135.54s - 2139.22s |  and look at data that I wasn't going to get at the public, at the public
2139.22s - 2141.74s |  library or on fucking, I don't know.
2141.74s - 2142.22s |  What do you got?
2142.22s - 2144.14s |  You guys watch those TV news things.
2144.30s - 2145.06s |  Is that what you guys do?
2145.50s - 2146.58s |  Anybody watch TV news?
2146.58s - 2147.46s |  Yo, don't watch that shit.
2147.46s - 2148.18s |  It's terrible.
2149.14s - 2151.82s |  So my point is, yo, they're going to just tell you whatever.
2151.82s - 2154.26s |  And I don't mean to make a, I could make a long comment on that, but my
2154.26s - 2157.62s |  main thing is that that was like part of the freedom of the hackers.
2157.62s - 2162.22s |  Like, yo, just pure information, contextualizing it for yourself.
2162.50s - 2165.94s |  And that's like also that rebel spirit that really defines
2165.94s - 2168.02s |  the mythology of the hacker.
2168.26s - 2169.30s |  All right, I'm gonna stop there.
2169.34s - 2169.70s |  Peace.
2175.88s - 2176.28s |  All right.
2176.92s - 2179.36s |  There are a couple of threads that came out of all these origin
2179.36s - 2181.20s |  stories that I want to pick up on the first one.
2181.20s - 2186.08s |  Let's just take a hook from what John was telling us about hacking.
2186.08s - 2187.44s |  What were the early techniques?
2187.44s - 2192.44s |  Like, what were you guys doing to make free calls and explore these
2192.44s - 2196.64s |  new communications channels or just let your imagination run wild
2196.64s - 2198.36s |  all over the information space?
2198.56s - 2200.56s |  So I, if I, I'll start out.
2201.80s - 2206.16s |  So I assume most people here have seen the movie war games, right?
2206.20s - 2208.76s |  You know, raise your hand if you haven't seen war games.
2209.84s - 2211.96s |  Oh yeah, there you go.
2211.96s - 2212.88s |  Now you've got some hope.
2212.92s - 2213.84s |  You got some homework.
2214.20s - 2221.28s |  Um, so most of this, most stuff in war games, you know, was not real,
2221.28s - 2225.20s |  but there were some, both kernels of, of actual practice and technology.
2225.40s - 2228.44s |  So, you know, there's a, you know, one of the plot points is Matthew
2228.44s - 2232.28s |  Broderick's character, um, just sets his computer to call every phone
2232.28s - 2233.56s |  number in an entire area code.
2233.56s - 2234.72s |  Cause he wants to find a system.
2235.04s - 2236.64s |  That is what we would do.
2236.68s - 2240.12s |  I mean, we actually called it war dialing after war, after, uh, after war
2240.12s - 2243.40s |  games, cause you set your computer call every phone number in, you know,
2243.40s - 2245.72s |  six, one, seven overnight, you wake up in the morning and you got a
2245.72s - 2247.12s |  list of where a computer answered.
2247.40s - 2250.48s |  It doesn't keep a list of how many people you woke up and swore into the phone.
2251.08s - 2254.12s |  But, um, and then you just call each one of these things to see
2254.12s - 2255.00s |  what answered at the other.
2255.00s - 2256.28s |  And some might be fax machines.
2256.28s - 2259.60s |  Some might, you know, you don't have nothing kind of really responds, but
2259.60s - 2262.84s |  some do, and then you figure out like, what is what, um, so that was like one
2262.84s - 2264.44s |  way we found systems before the internet.
2264.84s - 2267.88s |  Um, oh, yours is off.
2268.76s - 2272.04s |  No, no caller ID.
2272.20s - 2272.80s |  No caller ID.
2272.80s - 2275.44s |  So we could do this all night long and not worry.
2275.48s - 2275.98s |  Yeah.
2276.48s - 2281.04s |  And, uh, then also same with like to get, uh, phone codes.
2281.04s - 2283.12s |  Cause you know, calling cards, cause long distance calling was
2283.12s - 2284.16s |  really fucking expensive.
2284.16s - 2285.44s |  You know, dollars a minute kind of thing.
2285.84s - 2290.56s |  Um, as our parents found out, but, um, the, uh, so you'd set it, you'd
2290.56s - 2295.28s |  like find a local, uh, you know, the number for like a, uh, MCI credit
2295.28s - 2297.64s |  card or something, and you'd set your computer, just call it and basically
2297.76s - 2301.44s |  we were brute forcing and originally like these calling card codes were like
2301.44s - 2306.28s |  six digits, um, you know, and so you would, you would get them really quickly.
2306.52s - 2311.04s |  And again, like, it's actually like in hindsight, it's kind of surprising
2311.04s - 2314.04s |  that more of us didn't get in trouble for that, but like, I guess they just
2314.04s - 2318.72s |  weren't, it's so funny because that's what I was always worried I would get
2318.72s - 2321.84s |  in trouble for, and that's the one thing the feds didn't care about were free
2321.84s - 2326.84s |  phone calls, but the way that we would find things very similar, we just, uh,
2326.88s - 2333.00s |  800 number scan, I would go to pay phones and just dial manually and listen
2333.00s - 2336.96s |  for weird things picking up again, no caller ID, uh, you wouldn't
2336.96s - 2338.24s |  be traced on an 800 number.
2338.68s - 2342.88s |  Uh, and I remember we found something once called, um, and it'd be wild.
2342.88s - 2346.52s |  If anybody remembers this, it was called travel net run by general motors.
2346.64s - 2349.28s |  Anybody have any memory of this?
2349.32s - 2349.68s |  Okay.
2350.20s - 2351.56s |  Uh, one, one person.
2351.56s - 2351.88s |  Okay.
2352.20s - 2356.36s |  Uh, it was just some weird system that was actually voice activated.
2356.36s - 2362.28s |  You would speak the codes and it was, it was two sequences of four numbers.
2362.80s - 2365.76s |  Um, and we realized after, after getting a whole bunch of these codes that
2365.76s - 2367.20s |  they all added up to the same number.
2367.20s - 2370.44s |  I don't know why that was never figured that out, but the way we got our first
2370.44s - 2375.24s |  code was by social engineering, by calling general motors asking, uh, yeah,
2375.24s - 2376.52s |  you know, I'm over in accounting.
2376.52s - 2378.12s |  I need more info on the travel net system.
2378.36s - 2382.48s |  They directed us to a recording that showed people how to use
2382.48s - 2384.68s |  it and they used a demo code.
2385.48s - 2387.72s |  And I tried to demo code and it fucking worked.
2390.76s - 2391.60s |  I couldn't believe it.
2391.92s - 2395.04s |  And from there, you know, I just mixed the numbers around
2395.04s - 2396.64s |  a little bit and got more codes.
2396.64s - 2400.52s |  Before you knew it, we had a hundred codes and we could call all over the
2400.52s - 2404.84s |  place with that, without any fear of, of being, um, traced or caught.
2405.16s - 2408.60s |  Uh, the only problem was it would have a beep every now and then, uh, every
2408.60s - 2411.52s |  couple of minutes it would beep to indicate, I don't know what, uh, time
2411.52s - 2414.64s |  passing by, but that's hard if you're on a modem when that happens.
2414.64s - 2418.00s |  So that was the only disadvantage, but it sure was a gateway.
2418.16s - 2420.24s |  I think you like, you touched on a, on a good thing when you
2420.24s - 2421.24s |  mentioned social engineering.
2421.24s - 2425.36s |  Cause like as, as today back then, like I, the, what I always say is
2425.36s - 2428.40s |  that like the weakest link in any security chain is the human one.
2428.40s - 2431.12s |  And so, you know, it would be a matter of like, you know, finding people
2431.12s - 2433.64s |  and convincing people like, yeah, you know, I'm calling, you know, at the
2433.64s - 2436.56s |  time it wasn't it, but it was like, you know, I'm calling from the phone
2436.56s - 2437.88s |  company or I'm calling from this.
2437.88s - 2439.24s |  I'm calling from that, like that.
2439.24s - 2442.68s |  And dumpster diving to find like phone numbers, to find login information,
2442.68s - 2445.64s |  to find, you know, all kinds of like manuals, all kinds of stuff.
2445.64s - 2447.36s |  I mean, that's how, you know, you would learn stuff.
2447.36s - 2451.04s |  And then a lot of times if, if either you would type it up into a text
2451.04s - 2453.32s |  file to share with other people, or if you were lucky, other people
2453.32s - 2455.56s |  had already found this and that's what you were learning, learned from
2455.56s - 2458.60s |  is like, you know, I learned about Cosmos from like manuals that other
2458.60s - 2462.36s |  people at Cosmos was like a, a phone, like the phone company, AT&T is
2462.36s - 2464.92s |  basically phone database where they would set things up, et cetera.
2465.20s - 2466.92s |  And I learned about that from a text file.
2466.92s - 2470.28s |  It might've been an LOD technical journal that had like a Cosmos manual,
2470.28s - 2472.72s |  but yeah, I mean, that's kind of the way we were learning.
2472.80s - 2476.84s |  Just a quick work around though, with the, you know, yeah, all that stuff
2476.84s - 2480.84s |  with like caller ID and everything like that, yo, to work around with
2480.84s - 2484.72s |  that, when that came out, was it just, yo, you just hack a system and
2484.72s - 2487.28s |  he used a modem on a system that global out tile.
2487.76s - 2488.04s |  Yeah.
2488.28s - 2491.80s |  So a lot of times you would use like a proxy, which of course is nowadays.
2492.60s - 2496.36s |  That's the bread and butter of, you know, international hacking attacks
2496.36s - 2499.96s |  is to make sure that you have sort of like a proxy, but that was the
2499.96s - 2504.64s |  same thing back then, like early use of like proxies and out dials to mask
2504.68s - 2508.72s |  where you're making the call from and fuck them up the best is actually
2508.72s - 2510.52s |  when you hack from their computer.
2510.52s - 2514.64s |  And then it's kind of like a Mobius loop a little bit.
2515.00s - 2518.28s |  Another great method we used was something known as extenders.
2518.36s - 2520.08s |  You ever use extenders?
2520.36s - 2525.88s |  Basically, um, uh, you would call, say a plumber, uh, after hours and the
2525.88s - 2530.72s |  phone would, uh, forward, uh, using very crude forwarding method to an
2530.72s - 2534.12s |  answering service, the answering service would pick up wanting to take a message
2534.12s - 2535.84s |  for, for Joe, the plumber or whatever.
2536.28s - 2538.24s |  And you would, uh, wait for them.
2538.28s - 2539.08s |  You wouldn't say anything.
2539.08s - 2541.96s |  They'd eventually hang up and it would trip down to a dial tone, except
2541.96s - 2543.68s |  it was his dial tone, not yours.
2544.04s - 2547.80s |  So then you could make phone calls from the plumber's phone line.
2548.16s - 2552.04s |  I don't know why I'm picking on this plumber, but you know, any say a used
2552.04s - 2555.76s |  car dealer, anyone who forwarded their number after hours.
2556.04s - 2558.92s |  Oftentimes it would trip down to an unrestricted dial tone.
2559.00s - 2562.44s |  And, um, yeah, you would never be traced on that.
2562.56s - 2563.24s |  Also time.
2563.24s - 2564.76s |  Has it been kind to that term?
2564.76s - 2567.00s |  Cause now it sounds like a product at a gas station.
2569.36s - 2572.52s |  Another thing that we do is like, you know, um, for at least to make
2572.52s - 2578.32s |  free voice phone calls, um, was, uh, you know, you use actual piece of hardware.
2578.32s - 2582.96s |  I either you'd make one yourself, like a beige box, or you'd acquire
2582.96s - 2585.04s |  something completely legally.
2585.52s - 2588.64s |  Um, and not off of the back of a phone truck called alignment's
2588.64s - 2592.12s |  handset or lines, but set, um, which is basically, you know, some people
2592.12s - 2594.64s |  are some, actually somebody yesterday came up and gave me one for free,
2594.64s - 2598.32s |  which is amazing because my older one, an ex left with her.
2598.48s - 2600.32s |  So I was, I'm really excited to have it.
2600.48s - 2603.72s |  So it's basically, you know, like a little like phone, phone thing
2603.72s - 2608.24s |  with originally a dial and then later tile and just two clips for, uh,
2608.24s - 2609.48s |  you know, the two phone lines.
2609.48s - 2613.36s |  And you'd go outside a business, or I guess you could do somebody's house
2613.36s - 2617.12s |  or even like a big, like foam junction box and just clip on and you'd find
2617.12s - 2619.24s |  a live line, a live phone number.
2619.24s - 2620.44s |  And then you could just dial for free.
2620.48s - 2623.76s |  And so for instance, back at the loft, like the, the original, original
2623.76s - 2627.36s |  loft, like, which was a big industrial building, that's how we would make
2627.36s - 2630.16s |  free phone calls is we'd go back into like into the phone closet and just
2630.16s - 2633.28s |  clip on and just think, call other people, call you, call, you know, our
2633.28s - 2636.72s |  friends and other parts and, you know, then whatever business would get the
2636.72s - 2637.00s |  bill.
2637.00s - 2639.96s |  And, and, you know, we're punk kids.
2639.96s - 2641.24s |  We didn't give a shit.
2641.28s - 2644.56s |  We would get, we would get on our answering machine, um, an hour
2644.56s - 2650.84s |  long, uh, teleconference recording of 40 people just all talking at once.
2650.84s - 2653.16s |  And why not call 2,600 answering machine?
2653.16s - 2657.12s |  And, and then I, we'd, we'd have to wade through all this.
2657.44s - 2659.72s |  Uh, and then a few weeks later, we'd get a call from Alliance
2659.72s - 2662.24s |  telecom and said, do you know anybody who might've been calling
2662.24s - 2663.28s |  at this particular time?
2664.24s - 2669.80s |  What was really cool, what Eric was just mentioning, um, was, uh, Alliance
2669.80s - 2672.36s |  teleconferences, those are very popular.
2672.36s - 2677.52s |  And just, there were like voice chats for groups of, uh, neuro atypical
2677.52s - 2678.92s |  individuals who found them.
2679.20s - 2684.24s |  Um, but in, in terms of in-person cons, we had in-person conversations.
2684.48s - 2686.40s |  Yeah, very much so.
2686.68s - 2691.76s |  Um, but, uh, in, in terms of just like making calls, uh, the codes were
2691.76s - 2696.08s |  super helpful because you could, you know, set up something to scan them
2696.08s - 2699.72s |  and, you know, come back in the morning and you got a thousand of them.
2699.72s - 2701.92s |  You could just use them disposably.
2701.92s - 2705.72s |  You can call all over planet earth because back then that was
2705.72s - 2708.40s |  a significant barrier to entry.
2708.40s - 2710.36s |  I mean, now everything's free back then.
2710.36s - 2714.28s |  It's, you know, as has been mentioned, it's dollars per minute.
2714.92s - 2719.12s |  And, uh, then, then you discover, oh, Hey, I can just actually get into
2719.12s - 2722.68s |  their computer system and download all of their codes, which is
2722.68s - 2725.04s |  a lot more elegant and efficient.
2725.60s - 2731.28s |  And the really cool, uh, kind of collision of old and new technology
2731.28s - 2735.16s |  happened, uh, for me anyway, in, in New York city, because I had two
2735.16s - 2740.28s |  phone lines and one was, uh, an ESS, which is electronic switching.
2740.68s - 2745.00s |  That was brand new because they use out of, out of band signaling.
2745.00s - 2746.84s |  Everything was digital.
2747.08s - 2751.12s |  My other phone line was a crossbar five, which is a mechanical switch.
2751.16s - 2753.12s |  Everything is in band.
2753.12s - 2757.32s |  So that means you can trunk lines using 2,600 Hertz.
2757.88s - 2761.52s |  And, uh, there's software that was available for computers that
2761.52s - 2762.76s |  would let you generate that.
2762.76s - 2767.08s |  It would pop up a keypad and, uh, uh, it has a couple of extra keys.
2767.08s - 2771.40s |  There's like KPST, which is key pulse forward start.
2771.96s - 2776.92s |  Uh, and you know, essentially you're a TSPS operator, which is transit
2776.92s - 2781.28s |  service position switch, if I'm remembering it correctly across decades
2781.28s - 2785.92s |  of time, and you're basically an operator and you're invisible and
2785.92s - 2789.64s |  you're inside their network and you can do whatever you want, it's like
2789.68s - 2793.52s |  John mentioned, uh, it's one hell of a dopamine rush.
2793.52s - 2796.96s |  You just killed the final boss on that level.
2797.60s - 2797.84s |  Yeah.
2797.84s - 2801.16s |  Instead of working in the system of numbers, you're attacking
2801.16s - 2801.80s |  the system there.
2801.80s - 2804.48s |  You're working around it with the blue boxes and all the
2804.48s - 2806.24s |  various colored boxes back then.
2806.84s - 2809.20s |  I was going to, you know, when you're talking about codes, like, you
2809.20s - 2811.44s |  know, you'd get these things and they were, they're basically like
2811.72s - 2813.36s |  currency in the, in the hacker world.
2813.36s - 2814.20s |  Like you would trade them.
2814.20s - 2817.16s |  You, and so first of all, it was currency in terms of like, okay, I've
2817.16s - 2820.32s |  got this, what have you got, but also it was cred, like you would be like,
2820.32s - 2823.32s |  Hey, you know, you know, you call this BBS and it has all the, you
2823.32s - 2825.96s |  know, all, you know, good codes, you know, basically.
2825.96s - 2828.36s |  And this is like, a lot of this is like where the term zero day,
2828.36s - 2829.24s |  that's user exploits.
2829.24s - 2832.40s |  Now zero day originally was like, where's like freshly cracked
2832.40s - 2833.44s |  things and zero day codes.
2833.44s - 2834.60s |  Like they had just been cracked.
2834.60s - 2836.00s |  So, you know, you know, it's going to be good.
2836.00s - 2838.24s |  So somebody would have all the good, the good codes.
2838.24s - 2839.36s |  Then they were, you know, elite.
2839.92s - 2840.08s |  Yeah.
2840.08s - 2844.88s |  Or like a rad, not like anybody would reuse or retrade codes, right?
2844.92s - 2845.32s |  Well, no, no.
2845.32s - 2846.96s |  I mean, they would, but that's like, it's currency, you know,
2846.96s - 2848.20s |  like it gets passed around.
2848.24s - 2848.40s |  Yeah.
2848.40s - 2850.36s |  So I'm curious, how did all this evolve?
2850.36s - 2850.52s |  Right.
2850.52s - 2853.44s |  I mean, if you go back to these old text files, it's like, here's the
2853.44s - 2856.36s |  list of the default passwords for unit.
2856.36s - 2859.44s |  And like, obviously that, you know, stopped working after a certain point.
2859.84s - 2862.00s |  Um, what, what happened next?
2862.00s - 2862.12s |  Right.
2862.12s - 2865.20s |  You get into the nineties, security starts to become a thing.
2865.32s - 2869.24s |  You'd think it would stop working after a certain point, but in actuality,
2869.24s - 2870.96s |  it, it kept on for a long, long time.
2871.00s - 2873.40s |  How many things do you hear about still that it's like, oh, there's a default
2873.40s - 2874.84s |  password that's hard coded somewhere.
2874.84s - 2876.08s |  It's just like that still happens.
2876.08s - 2877.64s |  Like we have not, hence again.
2877.64s - 2878.12s |  There you go.
2878.12s - 2879.96s |  The old human file is still useful.
2880.72s - 2881.48s |  Admin admin.
2883.78s - 2884.26s |  That's true.
2884.26s - 2887.30s |  That, uh, default passwords still work today.
2887.46s - 2888.50s |  It's very nice.
2889.02s - 2889.78s |  Um, thank you.
2890.18s - 2894.82s |  I think that, uh, but in addition to that, one thing I think, you know, I, you
2894.82s - 2899.34s |  know, that I probably could speak to is that in the evolution of hacking, one of
2899.34s - 2905.14s |  the things that, you know, that I particularly practiced, um, is the idea
2905.14s - 2911.34s |  that in a way, you know, the password is the first entrance, but that's
2911.34s - 2913.18s |  like sucking on a baby bottle.
2913.62s - 2916.10s |  You want to graduate to drinking liquor.
2916.34s - 2921.02s |  And the way you do that is you say, yo, I don't need just one password.
2921.06s - 2924.74s |  I'm going to just take the whole password file and you start there.
2925.18s - 2929.90s |  Then that graduates to, yo, I just going to fucking take the whole network.
2930.14s - 2936.34s |  And that idea of like, sort of like bringing the lens back to like the
2936.34s - 2942.42s |  larger picture made it very easy to sort of like scale up the hacking
2942.82s - 2947.50s |  because once you see it as this thing, like some people will go like, yo, we
2947.50s - 2949.98s |  need ideas out the box, right?
2949.98s - 2952.78s |  Then there's some, some other person and they think they're even smarter.
2952.78s - 2954.62s |  They're like, but there is no box.
2954.78s - 2959.62s |  But to be honest, it's really a rhizomatic.
2959.66s - 2965.30s |  Like it's not, it's entire fucking surface of multiple domains.
2965.34s - 2972.02s |  And that idea was, that's, you know, what was able to allow, you know, uh, people
2972.02s - 2976.18s |  that I, you know, interacted with in the hacking sphere to be able to break into
2976.18s - 2977.38s |  so many computers.
2977.74s - 2981.26s |  And that once again, is that that's sort of like the evolution.
2981.26s - 2985.38s |  It went from those ideas of default passwords, getting in, learning it, but
2985.38s - 2989.70s |  then learning to the point where, like I said, it, yo, that the password just
2989.70s - 2990.58s |  became invisible.
2990.58s - 2992.98s |  That's just an individual user.
2992.98s - 2997.46s |  If you could see the whole system and take the system, everything's yours.
3001.88s - 3004.92s |  You know, John, you might be able to talk a little bit more about this.
3004.92s - 3009.00s |  Cause this is, you know, I think you have more personal experience, uh, than, than
3009.00s - 3012.72s |  many of us, you and other people in MOD about like, I mean, you own the phone
3012.72s - 3016.48s |  system and you could, you could do things with that, that like are still like kind
3016.48s - 3019.32s |  of mythical, like, you know, turning people's home phones into pay phones and
3019.32s - 3019.92s |  stuff like that.
3019.96s - 3020.84s |  Sorry, allegedly.
3021.20s - 3024.32s |  So maybe you can talk a little bit more like owning the system and like what that
3024.32s - 3029.48s |  was like and like, you know, both from a, an experiential and like, I don't know,
3029.80s - 3030.40s |  talk around that.
3031.00s - 3033.36s |  I mean, one of the things, thank you, first of all, thank you for that.
3033.64s - 3038.04s |  Um, I probably wasn't going to talk about the magic of, of, uh, phone hacking.
3038.04s - 3044.04s |  What's interesting is that, that yo, it is like this hidden network that controls
3044.04s - 3044.92s |  everything right now.
3044.92s - 3050.04s |  A lot of it has shifted to the idea about mobile, but yo, the original phone system
3050.04s - 3053.48s |  that still works is, it's amazing.
3053.48s - 3054.64s |  And it's complexity.
3054.92s - 3061.04s |  So many things came out of those initial, uh, engineers who design a system, but
3061.12s - 3062.16s |  how robust it is.
3062.16s - 3065.28s |  I mean, like it was literally built to survive nuclear attack.
3065.28s - 3069.44s |  Like you, you look around your town of any size and there is going to be like a
3069.44s - 3070.52s |  hardened building.
3070.52s - 3072.36s |  That's, that's the old phone switching office.
3072.52s - 3073.04s |  That's right.
3073.04s - 3078.68s |  And then system, system five actually paved the way for like what everyone uses
3078.68s - 3079.16s |  today.
3079.20s - 3083.88s |  So that idea about the phone system, yo, you could control everything.
3084.24s - 3086.44s |  There was like, you know, you can make service orders.
3086.44s - 3087.36s |  You could change things.
3087.36s - 3088.32s |  Yes, I did.
3088.40s - 3092.12s |  Uh, I love changing people's, uh, uh, you want to, you know,
3092.12s - 3093.64s |  yeah, you could turn it into a pay phone.
3093.92s - 3097.68s |  You could, uh, remember, I don't even remember if people don't know, maybe don't
3097.68s - 3098.92s |  know what a pay phone is, whatever it means.
3098.92s - 3103.72s |  Like you, you would pick up your phone at home and try to make a call and it would
3103.72s - 3105.52s |  be, please, please insert 25 cents.
3105.52s - 3106.68s |  It's like, what?
3107.32s - 3108.76s |  Yeah, I missed that.
3108.76s - 3116.28s |  So then, um, but yeah, no, I mean, effectively it's amazing that, yo, there's
3116.28s - 3120.68s |  so many things that we don't think about is control, you know, data passing through
3120.68s - 3123.04s |  these phone systems, both voice and data.
3123.28s - 3126.48s |  So yeah, it was unbelievable in that regard.
3126.48s - 3131.00s |  And then it was always like the, the, maybe the, that is the part that is maybe
3131.00s - 3135.88s |  mythical, but actually already written about is that, uh, you know, the DMS 100
3136.24s - 3142.40s |  had the famed, um, remote headset, um, um, which, yeah, you could listen in the
3142.40s - 3145.52s |  phone lines, like obviously like cross bar and the older ones, you had to have a
3145.52s - 3150.12s |  physical tap on the line, but then they were like, Oh shit, let's put remote
3150.32s - 3153.28s |  ability to listen in and yo, that shit.
3153.52s - 3153.92s |  Yeah.
3154.00s - 3155.12s |  Probably shouldn't touch that.
3155.16s - 3158.28s |  But anyway, it never existed, John.
3158.28s - 3160.04s |  It was an undocumented feature.
3160.12s - 3160.48s |  Yeah.
3160.48s - 3160.76s |  Yeah.
3160.80s - 3163.04s |  I love undocumented features.
3163.80s - 3164.16s |  Yeah.
3164.72s - 3168.84s |  To this day, even something dumb, I see a binary, I'll just hit like string on it
3168.84s - 3171.40s |  and just be like, what the fuck's in this motherfucker just in case.
3171.92s - 3176.08s |  But yeah, I think, um, you know, but just to, to, to close that out, the phone
3176.12s - 3180.60s |  system, I think it's interesting because so many, so many people have forgotten
3180.64s - 3184.92s |  about that aspect that, that was like this whole domain that still really does
3184.92s - 3185.40s |  exist.
3185.40s - 3190.28s |  And that includes like the, the complex, uh, signaling system seven, which
3190.28s - 3195.88s |  probably I shouldn't mention, but if you do know about it, whoa, there's multiple
3195.88s - 3198.60s |  stratas that control the data in this network.
3198.60s - 3202.96s |  And yeah, uh, probably no one's gonna mention it, but me and I'm done with it.
3202.96s - 3203.60s |  So, all right.
3204.44s - 3206.08s |  They being HLRs.
3206.68s - 3208.48s |  Patrick mentioned something really interesting.
3208.48s - 3210.48s |  He said a lot of this stuff is free today.
3211.00s - 3215.92s |  And I just want people to realize that that's all we wanted back then was to
3215.92s - 3217.36s |  make communications free.
3217.36s - 3224.37s |  We fucking won and we don't seem to realize we've, I mean, that was part of
3224.37s - 3224.61s |  the thing.
3224.61s - 3226.73s |  I said, be like, Oh, how can you steal from the phone company?
3226.73s - 3228.41s |  And it's like, you're not fucking stealing.
3228.41s - 3229.89s |  Cause you're not taking anything away.
3230.13s - 3230.25s |  Yeah.
3230.25s - 3232.09s |  If you're building it back to the phone, exactly.
3232.09s - 3232.33s |  Yeah.
3232.45s - 3236.33s |  And their, and their profits were first of all, untaxed, like my bell and just,
3236.33s - 3237.53s |  you know, tens of billions.
3237.85s - 3242.77s |  And, um, so, and it, we knew like it costs them nothing for a long distance
3242.77s - 3243.09s |  phone call.
3243.09s - 3244.69s |  It costs, you know, pennies, pennies, and they were charging.
3244.69s - 3246.09s |  And so it's like, you know, fuck you.
3246.09s - 3250.57s |  Like we're going to take it for free, all the spring codes, MCI codes, uh,
3250.57s - 3251.65s |  travel net, whatever.
3251.65s - 3254.65s |  It was all so that we could connect and talk to each other.
3254.81s - 3256.49s |  Something we all take for granted now.
3257.29s - 3257.49s |  Yeah.
3257.49s - 3262.45s |  And, and, um, computer access, you know, we all have Linux, you know, on, on our,
3262.45s - 3263.25s |  our laptops.
3263.25s - 3267.05s |  And back then, the only way you can on our televisions, on our light everywhere,
3267.85s - 3269.81s |  everywhere, all have access to something.
3269.81s - 3273.09s |  But back then the only way to get access to a Unix system was to either work for
3273.09s - 3276.61s |  the phone company or have an accredited account at a university, which many of us
3276.61s - 3277.09s |  did not have.
3277.09s - 3279.17s |  So breaking in was the only way to learn.
3279.29s - 3279.57s |  Yeah.
3279.61s - 3282.45s |  That, I mean, for me, that was like, you know, who's going to get a, you know, a
3282.45s - 3287.33s |  13 year old kid access to, you know, a Unix system in, in, you know, 1986.
3288.17s - 3289.09s |  Hey, you got any wares?
3289.25s - 3289.61s |  Sorry?
3290.05s - 3290.89s |  You got any wares?
3290.93s - 3291.73s |  Oh, you got any wares?
3292.29s - 3292.85s |  Hot wares.
3293.13s - 3293.33s |  Yeah.
3293.33s - 3296.73s |  Like, uh, um, and so it was really, you know, again, I grew up outside of Boston
3296.73s - 3300.61s |  where there's a lot of academia, a lot of, a lot of, uh, you know, tech companies
3301.05s - 3304.09s |  at the time, a lot of defense, you know, probably still a lot of defense industry
3304.09s - 3304.29s |  stuff.
3304.29s - 3308.09s |  So I'm kind of lucky I was doing this in the eighties and not, you know, 10 or 20
3308.09s - 3308.57s |  years later.
3308.97s - 3314.49s |  Um, but, uh, you know, if I wanted to learn about a new computer system, I had
3314.49s - 3317.57s |  to, you know, break into it and get access to it to like figure out, you know, to
3317.57s - 3317.93s |  learn about it.
3317.93s - 3318.77s |  And that's what I wanted to do.
3318.81s - 3324.37s |  So Emanuel brings up a good point about, you know, illustrating the fact that like
3324.37s - 3326.73s |  hacker culture changed so much.
3326.73s - 3331.37s |  It's, it spawned a trillion dollar industry, but it's more than that.
3331.37s - 3334.17s |  Even as you, I look around here, look at this community.
3334.65s - 3336.17s |  There is a special thing.
3336.17s - 3341.45s |  Like I still speak to hackers I know around the world from every country.
3341.81s - 3345.69s |  Um, sometime they don't like me cause maybe I hacked their country.
3345.93s - 3349.17s |  Yo, that's how understanding comes together.
3349.17s - 3351.25s |  But the main thing, hacker culture, it's incredible.
3351.25s - 3356.89s |  So just, can I just tie it into like the nineties, that eighties and nineties cruxable.
3357.05s - 3359.05s |  So now there were hackers that predated us, right?
3359.05s - 3360.01s |  Tap, blah, blah, blah.
3360.01s - 3363.65s |  I don't know what they listened to Grateful Dead or Arlo Guthrie.
3363.77s - 3365.13s |  There's nothing wrong with that.
3366.21s - 3367.65s |  I like a good, you know what I mean?
3367.65s - 3368.85s |  Choctaw Ridge or something.
3368.89s - 3374.01s |  But my point being that eighties and nineties was super special for the
3374.01s - 3378.01s |  acceleration of hacker culture and how much it changed everything.
3378.01s - 3383.33s |  And in that, in that is like, yo, there was like skateboarding running parallel to that.
3383.33s - 3388.13s |  There was expansion of hip hop that went from street music to like the number one
3388.13s - 3393.21s |  music in the entire planet, fucking punk music, fucking, and the overlap between
3393.21s - 3396.61s |  punk and hip hop that, that happened in New York.
3396.73s - 3402.21s |  All these amazing cultures that are part of the tapestry of our life all coincided
3402.21s - 3407.25s |  with the rise of hacking, all these communities, all these people who develop
3407.25s - 3410.05s |  like rich digital identities to this day.
3410.05s - 3414.25s |  Like I'm sure everybody here, like even the goons, everybody has these alternative
3414.25s - 3415.81s |  names that represents that.
3415.81s - 3421.33s |  But all of that kind of started with the anonymous names and additional pieces.
3421.33s - 3425.49s |  And like I said, the things that Manuel mentioned that, you know, in a lot of ways
3425.49s - 3428.25s |  that caused like conversations about free phones.
3428.25s - 3431.37s |  If that's what the consumers want, that's what we're going to give them.
3431.37s - 3435.53s |  And it's so many examples of how hacker culture has done that.
3435.53s - 3439.97s |  And even to today, pushing things like, you know, right of repair or like, you know,
3439.97s - 3444.93s |  or even the GitHub, that nature of like, yo, you know, like I, like I have a car
3444.93s - 3446.81s |  thing, for instance, you know what I mean?
3446.81s - 3448.93s |  And they shut it down, but like, it doesn't matter.
3448.93s - 3451.73s |  Yo, the community is going to come together, recode that shit.
3451.73s - 3452.45s |  And you know what I mean?
3452.45s - 3455.01s |  I'm going to turn it into like a toilet flusher with music.
3455.01s - 3456.33s |  But that's not the point.
3456.33s - 3461.81s |  The point is that that is an outgrowth of all that hacker culture that is embodied
3461.81s - 3463.05s |  here in this room today.
3463.05s - 3464.13s |  So just wanted to mention that.
3464.13s - 3465.41s |  I think that's a really good point.
3465.41s - 3471.65s |  Like, especially you mentioned GitHub and I never thought about it this way, but it
3471.65s - 3475.21s |  is, it is like, you know, the really the embodiment of the old, the hacker ethic of
3475.21s - 3478.13s |  like, you know, you, you, you share information, like you, you, you learn
3478.13s - 3481.05s |  something new and now you, or you write something new and you share it.
3481.05s - 3484.61s |  And that's like what a public repo is to a lot of degree or like, or open source,
3484.61s - 3486.85s |  you know, it's this like, Hey, I figured out this cool thing.
3486.85s - 3487.61s |  I've made this cool thing.
3487.73s - 3489.13s |  Now you can also use it.
3489.13s - 3491.53s |  Or, and you can also, you know, change it and make your own thing.
3491.65s - 3491.81s |  Yeah.
3491.81s - 3493.21s |  Let's stay, let's stick with this thread.
3493.21s - 3496.41s |  So everyone here is mentioning community, right?
3496.41s - 3497.53s |  This is a key thing.
3497.69s - 3501.69s |  You know, there's this profound development of this new information network, the phone
3501.69s - 3502.85s |  system, it's popular.
3502.85s - 3503.25s |  Why?
3503.45s - 3505.09s |  We can talk to each other, right?
3505.09s - 3507.65s |  And people are finding community, especially hackers.
3507.81s - 3509.61s |  So what happens when all this evolves, right?
3509.61s - 3513.81s |  How do we end up at this mega conference with what, like 30,000 people?
3514.49s - 3515.77s |  How did all, how did all that start?
3515.85s - 3519.53s |  Well, I think it probably started at the very, for early, you know, hacker cons,
3519.53s - 3523.49s |  which like, like party con summer con, like in the very late eighties.
3523.89s - 3526.81s |  Um, I think 90 or something like that.
3526.81s - 3529.65s |  Oh, even before that, I think Tommy, you were at like, weren't you at like one
3529.65s - 3530.61s |  of the first summer cons?
3530.61s - 3532.41s |  I said 91 to 92.
3532.41s - 3533.81s |  I grew up in the area.
3533.81s - 3535.41s |  So I had access.
3535.57s - 3538.97s |  So like we had summer cons that were put on at that point, it was like, you know,
3538.97s - 3541.53s |  maybe people would share a little bit of information, but it was informal.
3541.53s - 3543.65s |  It was basically like, you're meeting the face behind the monitor.
3543.65s - 3546.77s |  You go and like, you know, you go show up at this like motel in St.
3546.77s - 3549.81s |  Louis and there's like 20 other, you know, hacker people.
3549.81s - 3551.61s |  And one of them is agents deal.
3551.61s - 3557.49s |  Who's a fed, but, um, like, uh, or to be fair, actually not, uh, not actually fed
3557.49s - 3558.37s |  just an informant.
3558.85s - 3560.37s |  Uh, how did you guys not know that?
3561.09s - 3564.01s |  I mean, well, I mean, he did a lot of legitimate stuff.
3564.05s - 3568.13s |  It like he, so the agents deal was this guy, Justin Tanner Peterson, um, who
3568.13s - 3573.93s |  basically, uh, he legitimately was a phone freak who had owned, uh, the phone
3573.93s - 3577.81s |  company to the extent that he had basically could be caller number, whatever
3577.81s - 3578.69s |  for a radio station.
3578.69s - 3580.05s |  So he was winning vacations.
3580.05s - 3581.13s |  He was winning cars.
3581.13s - 3584.17s |  He was winning, you know, he was always like he was over always caller 99 or
3584.17s - 3584.49s |  whatever.
3584.85s - 3586.29s |  He eventually got busted for that.
3586.29s - 3588.93s |  So they turned state evidence, state's evidence, and would show up to these
3588.93s - 3591.61s |  cons and be, and ask like leading questions like, Oh yeah.
3591.61s - 3592.89s |  So what are you been up to recently?
3592.89s - 3595.01s |  Tell me about the new hacks and stuff.
3595.33s - 3599.13s |  Unfortunately he also, well, fortunately or unfortunately he couldn't stop, you
3599.13s - 3601.57s |  know, uh, fucking with shit himself.
3601.73s - 3602.97s |  So he got busted again.
3603.25s - 3607.41s |  And, and one of my favorite stories is that, so, so Justin, Justin had, he had
3607.41s - 3607.89s |  one leg.
3608.33s - 3612.13s |  Um, and when he was, when he was busted, the news, I remember the news article
3612.13s - 3614.33s |  was like, Oh, he was apprehended after a brief foot chase.
3614.33s - 3617.65s |  And I was like, I would hope it would be brief.
3619.89s - 3621.81s |  Well, these days he'd really get away.
3621.93s - 3622.41s |  Yeah.
3622.45s - 3623.41s |  What technology has done.
3626.01s - 3628.81s |  Oh, so I, I got distracted.
3629.41s - 3631.25s |  We ended up from cons to a fake leg.
3631.25s - 3631.41s |  Yeah.
3632.65s - 3633.25s |  Um, yeah.
3633.25s - 3636.65s |  So, so I think, you know, we started out with like these, these sort of very
3636.65s - 3639.49s |  informal just meeting up and then eventually like a kind of more formal,
3639.49s - 3640.89s |  like, okay, we're going to share information.
3641.17s - 3645.09s |  Cult of the dead cow in the, in the early nineties had the first, you know,
3645.33s - 3649.41s |  founded the first, um, hacker con where we actually invited journalists and
3649.41s - 3653.17s |  invited like even law enforcement to talk and to come and like meet hackers.
3653.53s - 3657.05s |  Cause there was this understanding that like, there was like, we saw that there
3657.05s - 3660.73s |  was a lack of understanding in law enforcement and judicial communities,
3660.73s - 3664.61s |  like as, as sort of Emmanuel alluded to earlier, this demonization of hackers,
3664.81s - 3668.05s |  where it's like hacker was synonymous with criminal and not like, not like a
3668.05s - 3671.25s |  cool criminal kind of necessarily, but like, you know, they were like, okay,
3671.25s - 3674.81s |  you know, you, you are, you know, almost like mobster or kind of, kind of thing.
3675.25s - 3681.45s |  Um, but, uh, so, you know, we wanted to, to meet these people and sort of, uh, uh,
3681.45s - 3684.33s |  have, be able to have conversations and, and it's, you know, it's harder to
3684.33s - 3687.05s |  demonize somebody once you've met them, you know, once you, once you interact
3687.05s - 3692.81s |  with them and so, um, you know, and then that, that DEF CON was founded by Jeff
3692.81s - 3696.41s |  Moss and he, he kind of carried on that idea with the whole, like bringing in,
3696.49s - 3699.69s |  uh, explicitly like feds to talk and things like that.
3699.69s - 3703.21s |  And they had, you know, the spot, the fed contest, et cetera, um, to sort
3703.21s - 3707.01s |  of like make it a game, but yeah, I mean, it's, if I can jump in for one
3707.17s - 3711.49s |  sec, what you're saying right there was really interesting because Mindvox had,
3711.49s - 3718.13s |  uh, a forum that was actually moderated by, uh, Kim Clancy, who at the time was
3718.13s - 3720.21s |  a active secret service agent.
3720.77s - 3724.73s |  And the participants were many of the people, the secret service had just
3724.73s - 3730.49s |  raided an operation Sun Devil, including legion of doom members and a collection
3730.49s - 3732.53s |  of other very colorful people.
3733.25s - 3740.33s |  So it was a conversation and sometimes it's slightly psychotic and angry and
3740.33s - 3743.77s |  stuff, but communication was taking place.
3743.81s - 3751.21s |  And the people who had arrested in some cases, prosecuted the individuals were
3751.21s - 3756.09s |  able to sit there and interact with them, talk with them after all this was over
3756.09s - 3761.69s |  and done with, and try to come to some sort of understanding regarding why this
3761.73s - 3763.05s |  occurred, what had happened.
3763.05s - 3766.57s |  And it was just like super cool because it's like, Hey, you're a secret service
3766.57s - 3766.93s |  agent.
3766.93s - 3770.89s |  You want to talk to people and understand the whole culture.
3770.89s - 3771.89s |  It was really awesome.
3772.33s - 3774.69s |  I wonder, John, do you, do you have like any, any views on this?
3774.69s - 3779.41s |  Cause I know like you come out of a much more, you know, you, you guys were in the
3779.41s - 3783.57s |  shit and like, you know, and, and, you know, paid the price to some extent for,
3783.61s - 3787.29s |  you know, from these feds that we're talking like all like, oh yeah, you know,
3787.29s - 3789.97s |  we're meeting, we're, we're getting like, you know, we're being all friendly with
3789.97s - 3793.29s |  and, and you had, you know, had a bit of a different friends though.
3793.33s - 3795.17s |  I mean, I didn't really go to cons.
3795.21s - 3799.25s |  I mean, part of it is like, yeah, you know, I just like breaking a computer that I
3799.25s - 3806.93s |  need to go like to a con, but I think, you know, I, yeah, I think, um, I, I, all
3806.93s - 3809.49s |  right, could I, I got two things thinking about that though.
3809.81s - 3814.09s |  I don't want to take it too far off track, but one thing is interesting in talking
3814.09s - 3819.93s |  about that is for instance, um, yo, is there, uh, uh, how many people,
3819.93s - 3822.45s |  go to ethical hacker con?
3824.41s - 3825.37s |  Like one, right?
3825.37s - 3826.37s |  Two, three, no one.
3826.37s - 3827.97s |  Oh, I thought you meant just a ethical hacker con.
3827.97s - 3833.57s |  So my point being is like, yo, the mythology really lies with the, the idea
3833.61s - 3837.05s |  of the hacker that breaks into stuff and explores things.
3837.05s - 3841.53s |  I think it's funny that they have all these terms, ethical hacker, blah, blah,
3841.53s - 3845.29s |  blah, the white hat, black hat, divided, god I hate that term, you know what I mean?
3845.29s - 3849.09s |  Like, what the fuck that, you know, me, I like non-binary hats.
3849.25s - 3852.21s |  I don't, that shit's ridiculous when you put things in a box like that.
3852.57s - 3857.93s |  But my point being is that that is, it's, it, it, it goes to like talking about
3857.93s - 3862.25s |  how the other thing that I wanted to mention about cons is I also didn't go
3862.25s - 3867.37s |  to them because in a lot of ways it represents, like, for instance, and I,
3867.37s - 3868.77s |  and I don't mean to cause trouble.
3868.77s - 3870.65s |  I just want to have a conversation about it.
3870.85s - 3874.61s |  Like, for instance, like a, like a woman didn't wind up on, on this
3874.61s - 3875.85s |  panel, for instance, right.
3876.21s - 3878.61s |  And I have no problem talking about that.
3878.61s - 3881.09s |  I think it's good to have conversations about these things
3881.37s - 3882.97s |  because there were women around.
3882.97s - 3887.53s |  I think I even mentioned that Sheila Averbach taught me computers.
3887.85s - 3890.05s |  So Susan Thunder was also around.
3890.05s - 3893.17s |  Susan Thunder, like, I think it was mad people, but like at the same, but
3893.17s - 3894.45s |  she wouldn't come to the panel.
3894.45s - 3895.89s |  She's not her jam.
3895.93s - 3899.85s |  Um, but, but I think it's, I thought, I thought I would just have that just
3899.85s - 3904.17s |  as a part of partial part of the dialogue because, you know, women were
3904.17s - 3906.61s |  around during all those periods.
3906.61s - 3911.93s |  But like, in a lot of ways, you know, them not being represented on a one
3911.97s - 3916.69s |  person that out of all the people not represented also reflects a bit, like
3916.69s - 3921.37s |  why I didn't go to cons too much because in a lot of ways, like, yeah, sure.
3921.41s - 3925.25s |  They're like, John, you got voluminous knowledge, but like, yo, it's still,
3925.25s - 3931.69s |  it felt like, like the other, and it's not necessarily ethnicity based.
3931.73s - 3934.69s |  It's also could be like class based or whatever.
3934.69s - 3937.81s |  It just was a different way to navigate.
3937.81s - 3942.73s |  And then, you know, a lot of people would say like, okay, well, um, yeah,
3942.73s - 3946.69s |  they don't have a good concept that like, you know, you don't have to have a
3946.69s - 3950.41s |  conspiracy to have conspiracy like effects, but when you set up a thing where
3950.41s - 3954.37s |  there seems to be like an underlying, like sort of misogyny in certain languages
3954.37s - 3959.21s |  that you may take people take for granted is normal, normal for them actually
3959.21s - 3963.53s |  puts people off or they say like, you know what, maybe this culture isn't for
3963.53s - 3967.13s |  me and they walk away and they, you know, for the person they think, oh shit,
3967.13s - 3968.41s |  that was so funny.
3968.41s - 3970.01s |  I'm so fucking Chad.
3970.01s - 3975.05s |  But in reality, yo, they totally made someone's fucking life path curve to
3975.05s - 3976.25s |  something they may really want to do.
3976.29s - 3978.13s |  I think that that's a valuable point.
3978.13s - 3980.49s |  Cause like, you know, we're, we're talking about here and we're, we're like
3980.49s - 3983.57s |  talking about like, oh, this, this great community and stuff like that, but you
3983.57s - 3986.73s |  know, it's a great community that we were welcomed into and like, I don't, you
3986.73s - 3987.73s |  know, we can't sugarcoat it.
3987.73s - 3989.09s |  Like there was a lot of misogyny.
3989.09s - 3992.57s |  There was a lot of sexism, a fucking hell of a lot of homophobia, like just
3992.57s - 3996.69s |  casual, like not, you know, most of it I think wasn't really, you know, vicious.
3996.69s - 4001.61s |  However, you know, you're using terms that make people, people feel unwelcome.
4001.61s - 4004.81s |  And, and just, you know, just building on that, just a historical point is that
4004.81s - 4008.77s |  one, one hacker that I was cool with, anybody remember Traxtor?
4008.85s - 4011.85s |  Oh, uh, speaking of feds or speaking of narcs.
4011.89s - 4013.61s |  Well, he didn't narc on me.
4014.61s - 4021.38s |  So if you don't know Traxtor, he was a blind and he also identified as gay and
4021.38s - 4022.82s |  like, yo, the kids would make fun of him.
4022.82s - 4025.38s |  And I was just like, you're my boy.
4025.54s - 4026.06s |  Yeah.
4026.42s - 4027.50s |  And he taught me a lot too.
4027.50s - 4033.66s |  So one thing I wanted to say is that, um, uh, the scene was, I think, more
4033.66s - 4037.54s |  inclusive than a lot of, a lot of things that were going on in the nineties,
4037.78s - 4042.78s |  because some of the most successful people from our scene, uh, were gay.
4043.14s - 4046.46s |  People from our scene, uh, are women.
4046.86s - 4047.18s |  It's true.
4047.18s - 4050.34s |  Um, some of the most successful, successful people that I know are, are women.
4050.34s - 4051.14s |  Heather Adkins.
4051.14s - 4052.26s |  And yeah, yeah.
4052.26s - 4053.58s |  Window and window.
4053.58s - 4053.78s |  Yeah.
4053.78s - 4054.10s |  Windows.
4054.46s - 4055.10s |  Lady Ada.
4055.22s - 4055.66s |  Lady Ada.
4055.66s - 4056.14s |  Lady Ada.
4056.14s - 4062.78s |  I mean, yeah, it was, I mean, inclusion, we were, we were, I think we were, we
4062.78s - 4066.58s |  were much more inclusive than at least some of the things that were going on there.
4066.66s - 4067.66s |  I think that's true.
4067.66s - 4072.14s |  But I also think that like, it was to some extent, like, I mean, it's been,
4072.74s - 4077.14s |  you know, speaking as, you know, I can only speak as a straight white man.
4077.18s - 4081.34s |  Like, um, but like, I think that things are getting better and I think it's,
4081.34s - 4082.78s |  it's gotten, gotten better over time.
4082.78s - 4087.38s |  It's not only work with women now, so it's, it's, it's, but yeah, I mean,
4087.38s - 4091.94s |  like CDC was the first group to the first hacker group to sort of induct
4091.94s - 4094.58s |  a woman member, um, lady Carolyn.
4095.18s - 4098.86s |  Um, but then, you know, and I'm not trying to pat ourselves on our
4098.86s - 4101.38s |  back or anything like that because it took us, you know, you know, almost
4101.38s - 4102.82s |  30 years to induct another woman.
4102.82s - 4106.26s |  So it's like, what's, what's that that, you know, and, and I'm not, I don't
4106.26s - 4110.10s |  mean to suggest that she was any sort of like, you know, a token or anything
4110.10s - 4111.34s |  like that, she was fucking awesome.
4111.34s - 4112.66s |  So that's why we invited her in.
4113.06s - 4118.66s |  But, you know, there was this, yeah, it's, I think there's a, there
4118.66s - 4120.10s |  has been something systemic.
4121.06s - 4123.70s |  There's no question that it was, it was, um, a different
4123.70s - 4125.90s |  environment back in the eighties.
4126.30s - 4130.58s |  Um, early summer cons were almost exclusively straight white males.
4130.90s - 4132.50s |  Um, who all knew each other.
4132.78s - 4135.46s |  It was uncomfortable because if you didn't know them, yeah.
4135.46s - 4137.30s |  If you didn't know that these people, if you weren't in good
4137.30s - 4139.06s |  with them, you were ostracized.
4139.54s - 4144.94s |  Um, and that's, that's part of our growing pains, uh, that we eventually,
4145.34s - 4149.46s |  uh, started to be more inclusive, but it didn't happen right away.
4149.54s - 4150.50s |  It didn't happen right away.
4150.94s - 4155.86s |  Um, and as soon as the, uh, the kids from the city got involved, all of a
4155.86s - 4160.06s |  sudden the media was all over it saying, oh my God, this is a real danger to
4160.06s - 4162.74s |  the average American, you know, you saw the difference.
4162.74s - 4165.82s |  We saw all kinds of racism, sexism, homophobia.
4166.22s - 4167.14s |  We're not immune from that.
4167.14s - 4167.90s |  We still aren't.
4168.14s - 4172.78s |  But looking around here, looking around, uh, what I see at hope, boy,
4172.78s - 4173.70s |  we've come a long way.
4173.70s - 4174.94s |  I'm proud of this community.
4174.94s - 4176.70s |  I'm proud of what we are trying to do.
4177.10s - 4178.74s |  Uh, but let's just not forget.
4178.74s - 4180.66s |  It's a work in progress and we have to keep trying.
4184.74s - 4186.50s |  Okay, let's, let's come back.
4186.54s - 4188.74s |  Let's say one thing that like, you know, you're talking about when the
4188.74s - 4190.74s |  kids from the city got home, this is something I was speaking to John
4190.74s - 4195.50s |  about earlier, like about how, um, you need the New York scene specific.
4195.50s - 4197.74s |  Like New York is a very diverse city and stuff.
4197.74s - 4202.58s |  So like when you guys, I think we're much more sort of like MOD specifically,
4202.58s - 4206.34s |  like much more sort of like a diverse group than, you know, for certainly
4206.34s - 4210.78s |  CDC or many, many of the LOD, lots of other groups out there came out of a
4210.78s - 4212.94s |  different culture, everybody in there.
4212.94s - 4213.78s |  It was really good.
4213.78s - 4216.26s |  I mean, I think anybody seen that movie hackers.
4217.90s - 4218.26s |  All right.
4218.50s - 4220.66s |  I only just saw it for the first time.
4221.14s - 4225.30s |  No, the other day they invited me to what the Academy to see it.
4225.30s - 4225.74s |  Right.
4226.34s - 4227.14s |  I never saw it.
4227.74s - 4231.98s |  Part of it is that that movie actually kind of steals from it's, it's based
4232.02s - 4238.22s |  roughly on, on, uh, on MOD, but whatever conversation about it, you know what I'm
4238.22s - 4238.50s |  saying?
4238.50s - 4244.50s |  Like I don't touch that film, but I will say I love the diversity and it does
4244.50s - 4249.26s |  represent what New York was like, both in terms of like gender identity in the
4249.26s - 4255.26s |  film, fucking the different ethnicities, even small twist on a dial, like, you
4255.26s - 4258.94s |  know, like different, like, you know, like even like, I just, I'll just say it
4258.94s - 4262.54s |  like a, you know, like there was like Afro Latina as well as Latinos.
4262.54s - 4268.02s |  Like it doesn't like all these like small pieces that for me was like every day in
4268.02s - 4270.22s |  New York city is reflected in that film.
4270.50s - 4273.62s |  So obviously that's why I like, you know, I didn't come to cons cause I was like,
4274.62s - 4276.58s |  I don't need to go to the cons, you know what I'm saying?
4276.58s - 4280.86s |  And it is just fucking hackers in New York that represent all of that.
4280.86s - 4284.74s |  Both, you know, like I said, is it, but it was also really good for me cause it
4284.74s - 4286.70s |  really expanded my boundaries.
4286.70s - 4290.50s |  But you can see where sometimes that might have come up against other people who
4290.50s - 4294.66s |  were like, well, I'm just going to say something out of turn about all these,
4294.90s - 4299.38s |  this whole group of people who have feelings and identities and skills, but I'm
4299.38s - 4301.30s |  just going to dismiss them with one word.
4301.34s - 4303.06s |  And, you know, but you know what?
4303.14s - 4306.26s |  Luckily those days over mostly.
4308.06s - 4308.46s |  All right.
4308.46s - 4308.70s |  Right.
4310.58s - 4314.22s |  Let me, let me come back to another really important aspect of the early hacker
4314.22s - 4314.66s |  scene.
4314.94s - 4316.06s |  Um, so here's the next question.
4316.06s - 4320.90s |  How did text files in zines shape hacking culture and why perhaps do they hold
4320.90s - 4322.42s |  relevance for today?
4322.62s - 4326.38s |  I think, I think Patrick, you might have, cause you know, you, you were before,
4326.74s - 4329.06s |  you're older than us in terms of in the scene and like,
4329.42s - 4330.46s |  I'm 300 and
4331.46s - 4331.74s |  Oh yeah.
4331.74s - 4335.42s |  I mean like LOD, as I said, like one of my introduction was LOD text files.
4335.54s - 4339.06s |  So like I, you know, the LOD technical journals, I don't know if you have a,
4339.38s - 4341.62s |  anything you want to talk about how you guys started.
4341.70s - 4345.18s |  And you've read some pretty mind blowing text files in your day.
4345.18s - 4345.50s |  So.
4346.30s - 4350.14s |  Yeah, I'm a, I, I, I write out my, my thoughts and stuff.
4350.18s - 4354.58s |  It was all of us just kind of began as extended rants that were taking place
4354.58s - 4355.30s |  online.
4355.70s - 4360.74s |  The, the whole culture of, you know, K rad, the, the, you know,
4360.78s - 4364.70s |  instead of using an exclamation point, there's an exclamation point, a one,
4364.74s - 4367.22s |  another exclamation point, a two, a string of zeros,
4367.58s - 4371.14s |  because people actually did that when they were posting like, Oh,
4371.18s - 4373.30s |  they're brand new uploaded cracked software.
4373.30s - 4374.30s |  It was very exciting.
4374.30s - 4375.42s |  Everything was zero day.
4375.70s - 4378.66s |  We were mocking things that were really happening.
4378.66s - 4382.98s |  And that sort of like metamorphosed into being culture.
4382.98s - 4387.90s |  And we, we wrote about it and we at a certain point in
4387.90s - 4391.30s |  time, you just kind of like step back and you start mocking yourself.
4391.30s - 4393.66s |  It's like, okay, I'm Lee tweet.
4393.66s - 4395.62s |  We have climbed this great mountain.
4395.62s - 4397.78s |  We are all together at the top of it.
4397.78s - 4399.66s |  And it's, it's all a bunch of bullshit.
4400.38s - 4401.50s |  But what is my name?
4401.54s - 4403.38s |  I'm I'm fluffy bunny.
4403.42s - 4405.14s |  I'm nobody I'm invisible.
4405.18s - 4406.58s |  Just don't pay any attention to me.
4406.58s - 4408.10s |  And you can tell me how great you are.
4408.54s - 4414.02s |  And all of that sort of filtered down and made its way into the text files.
4414.02s - 4420.98s |  They sort of were, uh, pieces of culture and time sort of embedded
4420.98s - 4425.98s |  in just in a text file that would sort of help you get into the headspace
4426.02s - 4430.18s |  of what it was like at that particular intersection point.
4430.58s - 4434.62s |  And right now, you know, 35 years after I can't enter that
4434.62s - 4436.34s |  headspace like at will.
4436.34s - 4438.86s |  I have to sort of coax myself into it.
4438.86s - 4440.74s |  Cause I haven't been there in a long time.
4440.74s - 4446.18s |  And, uh, that, that, that, that's basically, I'll pass it right back to
4446.18s - 4450.62s |  you because that, that group CDC, I, I think it's done a lot of text files.
4451.58s - 4454.22s |  Number 200 was awesome.
4454.26s - 4456.82s |  You see 200 is that's, that's the high point for me.
4456.82s - 4459.62s |  So if you're not read it, that's, that's the way to go through the good starting
4459.62s - 4459.86s |  point.
4460.34s - 4464.98s |  Um, yeah, I mean, CDC started out as like, uh, was founded by, by, you know,
4465.06s - 4470.10s |  punk kids in Lubbock, Texas who like, uh, uh, you know, were hanging out in
4470.10s - 4475.06s |  abandoned slaughterhouse, um, you know, playing heavy metal music and punk and
4475.06s - 4478.26s |  skateboarding and like, also just trying to like, you know, they were counter
4478.26s - 4481.50s |  culture sort of things like trying to, cause it was, you know, especially back
4481.50s - 4483.86s |  then it was very conservative, like socially conservative.
4484.34s - 4487.86s |  Um, and so kind of rebelling against that, but like, and then just, we're
4487.86s - 4490.14s |  going to write the shit down and there's that.
4490.14s - 4494.74s |  And then also certainly CDC was born out of a, like, I think this is a
4494.74s - 4498.78s |  thread that runs through cultivated cow in general is like this sort of, um, not
4498.78s - 4503.10s |  just anti-establishment area, like abolition, anti-establishment NIS, but,
4503.14s - 4509.02s |  uh, also, um, kind of like wanting to poke holes in anybody or anything that,
4509.02s - 4510.78s |  that takes itself too seriously.
4511.10s - 4514.66s |  And so we would like write like parodies of hacker files and things like that
4514.66s - 4516.86s |  originally and, and publish them.
4517.22s - 4522.98s |  But, uh, I think, you know, as your point, like, uh, talking about like K rad and
4522.98s - 4525.54s |  putting these numbers, I think that's something that come out of text files and
4525.54s - 4527.38s |  come into the hacker community that a lot of people don't understand.
4527.38s - 4531.14s |  Like the whole, you know, whether it's elite speak, you know, 3, 1, 3, 3, 7, and
4531.14s - 4533.62s |  stuff, that's something that, you know, CDC has said like, Hey, you know, we were
4533.62s - 4535.10s |  the ones that first did that or whatever.
4535.54s - 4539.10s |  And, uh, other things like now, like things that have entered the, the, the.
4539.74s - 4544.14s |  Like mainstream consciousness, like owned, like the, as a verb, like, Oh, he owned
4544.14s - 4548.46s |  that, or, you know, he owns the system owns pwns shirts at that too, but that is
4548.46s - 4549.50s |  directly at a hacking system.
4549.50s - 4551.18s |  You owned a system like that.
4551.22s - 4556.14s |  And now it's just entered the, like, it was never a verb in that sense before it
4556.14s - 4556.78s |  came out of the hacker.
4556.78s - 4560.58s |  We're doxxed that you hear that on the, on the news, you hear news commentators
4560.58s - 4561.82s |  saying he was doxxed.
4561.86s - 4562.02s |  Yeah.
4562.06s - 4563.30s |  It's like, what the fuck is happening?
4563.30s - 4563.46s |  Right.
4563.46s - 4563.98s |  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4567.82s - 4568.74s |  What about the zines?
4568.74s - 4570.78s |  Emmanuel, do you want to tell us about like the early days of that?
4571.18s - 4574.94s |  Well, it was a beautiful period in the nineties because zines were exploding
4574.94s - 4575.62s |  everywhere.
4575.66s - 4577.54s |  Uh, how many of you remember tower books?
4578.34s - 4579.14s |  What a great place.
4579.14s - 4583.46s |  That's what got us started on newsstands was a connection to tower books and then
4583.46s - 4587.42s |  all the other bookstores, which were around then independent ones, uh, would
4587.42s - 4591.18s |  also want our zine and a hundred other zines.
4591.62s - 4595.82s |  Uh, then the chains moved in borders, Barnes and Noble and drove them out of
4595.82s - 4596.30s |  business.
4596.46s - 4601.10s |  Then the chain started going out of business and with them, um, they kind of
4601.10s - 4605.38s |  took a lot of the small independent zines with them because they had no real way to
4605.38s - 4606.06s |  survive.
4606.58s - 4610.34s |  Um, I remember, uh, my gun Delores fact sheet five, anybody ever read that?
4610.70s - 4615.58s |  It was the zine of zines and every issue would be a review of your latest issue.
4615.98s - 4617.22s |  Uh, it was the coolest thing.
4617.22s - 4621.06s |  It was just this, um, explosion of creativity and some of the zines were
4621.06s - 4625.74s |  handwritten, but you could find them in bookstores all over the country.
4626.22s - 4631.18s |  Um, yeah, it's replaced by, um, uh, you know, webpages and blogs and things like
4631.18s - 4631.34s |  that.
4631.34s - 4632.14s |  It's not the same.
4632.42s - 4632.98s |  It's not the same.
4632.98s - 4636.94s |  People still have collections of their zines from the nineties that they will
4636.94s - 4637.82s |  never let go of.
4638.26s - 4641.70s |  Um, and I'm, I'm just hoping, you know, I'm seeing more independent bookstores
4641.70s - 4642.90s |  opening these days.
4643.18s - 4647.46s |  I'm hoping to see more printed zines as well, because you know, that, that is just
4647.46s - 4650.06s |  something that you can't replace digitally.
4650.22s - 4652.62s |  There are some stores that like, especially like if you ever go to San
4652.62s - 4657.02s |  Francisco, silver sprocket in the mission or in Chicago, Quimby's like are basically
4657.02s - 4661.46s |  stores that specialize in zines, like both sort of like, you know, comic stuff, but
4661.46s - 4662.62s |  also like DIY.
4662.62s - 4664.54s |  It's, it's, you know, the same, the same stuff.
4664.74s - 4668.46s |  I think one thing you mentioned about like the, the idea of like, uh, the, the
4668.46s - 4672.18s |  zine of zines and reviews of things like that ties into text files, because one of
4672.18s - 4675.34s |  the other reasons you, you would get text files is that the bottom of every text
4675.34s - 4679.34s |  file, a lot of times be a list of other elite BBSs like phone numbers.
4679.34s - 4683.26s |  And so you'd find that and like, uh, I, you know, going back to myself in 86
4683.26s - 4687.46s |  finding this, this, uh, this disc, like with, with text files at the bottom are
4687.46s - 4688.14s |  all these phone numbers.
4688.14s - 4690.58s |  And I was like, okay, like I can call these up and some of them are down.
4690.58s - 4693.50s |  Cause you know, some of these things were a couple of years up older, but some
4693.50s - 4696.18s |  were still up and it's like, and then it sort of builds and builds and builds and
4696.18s - 4700.90s |  you, your network, you know, social network sort of, uh, um, Veggie.
4701.22s - 4701.54s |  Yeah.
4701.58s - 4702.98s |  I think, I feel like this alternative media, right.
4702.98s - 4703.78s |  It's so crucial.
4703.86s - 4704.14s |  Yeah.
4704.38s - 4704.54s |  Yeah.
4704.78s - 4709.58s |  I will say that the very first time that I laughed out loud in front of a computer
4709.58s - 4713.90s |  screen from reading something was, was drunk fucks going to McDonald's and trying
4713.90s - 4716.66s |  to order a big Mac with four patties, a quadro pounder.
4716.66s - 4716.90s |  Yeah.
4717.66s - 4717.98s |  Yeah.
4718.34s - 4719.42s |  Uh, no veggies.
4719.42s - 4720.10s |  Don't wrap it.
4720.10s - 4723.94s |  Throw it on the founder and I'll take it like a pounder bitch.
4724.02s - 4724.34s |  Yeah.
4724.42s - 4725.74s |  This is your homework assignment.
4725.74s - 4728.14s |  If you're in the audience, read this text file tonight.
4728.38s - 4729.42s |  It will change your life.
4731.30s - 4731.66s |  All right.
4731.70s - 4735.62s |  I want to do one more question before we open the floor for questions.
4735.82s - 4737.10s |  Where is all this going?
4737.14s - 4740.02s |  Where, what is the relevance, especially of these older ideas?
4740.14s - 4742.06s |  I mean, think about what the internet is today, right?
4742.06s - 4743.10s |  It's very corporate.
4743.34s - 4744.62s |  It's centralizing.
4744.86s - 4748.98s |  Um, I think there definitely is a need for fresh voices and alternative media, right?
4748.98s - 4751.94s |  Zines text files, can this stuff actually come back, right.
4751.94s - 4754.34s |  And have this kind of relevance like it did back in the eighties and nineties.
4754.42s - 4758.02s |  I mean, I, I think it's important to point out that like the, the tech world
4758.02s - 4762.98s |  today is run by, and you know, the founded by people who are, were hackers.
4763.06s - 4763.46s |  Exactly.
4763.46s - 4766.78s |  I mean, everything from, from Steve Wozniak and Steve jobs, you like the way
4766.78s - 4770.50s |  they got the money to, to build the first Apple ones is by selling blue boxes, you
4770.50s - 4774.54s |  know, like, and, and it, you look at how many companies are out there, how many
4774.54s - 4777.50s |  big businesses like came out of like people from the hacker scene, like it's,
4777.78s - 4778.94s |  it's not to be underestimated.
4778.94s - 4780.18s |  How did it get so bland then?
4780.46s - 4780.58s |  Yeah.
4780.58s - 4781.38s |  They all got corrupt.
4781.90s - 4783.30s |  People get boring and they want money.
4785.74s - 4785.94s |  Yeah.
4785.94s - 4787.26s |  That's part of the issue.
4787.26s - 4788.06s |  Selling out.
4788.22s - 4788.58s |  Yeah.
4788.62s - 4793.38s |  Well, no, I think, I think, well, well, first I just want, let me just sideways
4793.38s - 4799.54s |  say that like another parallel technical culture that grew up with hacking and
4799.54s - 4802.22s |  parallel was EDM, like EDM matured.
4802.22s - 4806.14s |  I don't know if you guys know, like the Detroit scene, like, you know, and
4806.14s - 4811.94s |  connected, I mean, initially influenced by German, Germany, which also had an
4811.94s - 4814.90s |  amazing hackering culture to this day.
4814.98s - 4819.54s |  Yo, that ran parallel, but in terms of like where, like in terms of what you're
4819.54s - 4825.38s |  saying, like there's also been a rapid commodification in terms of like security,
4825.38s - 4830.94s |  like in a lot of ways, once again, people think about the mythology of hackers.
4830.94s - 4831.26s |  Right.
4831.26s - 4835.18s |  But then it's been commoditized so effectively.
4835.18s - 4837.42s |  Cause yo, you just get your like a life hacking.
4840.82s - 4846.58s |  So you, it's so easy to like, sort of like, um, um, uh, yeah, all the channels
4846.58s - 4851.38s |  have been commodified in a way and that in a way suppresses culture because like
4851.38s - 4856.26s |  you could just monetize it so fast and that doesn't give a culture breathing room.
4856.30s - 4859.98s |  Now I think that culture is still there evolving and stuff.
4859.98s - 4860.58s |  I see it.
4860.58s - 4863.22s |  But like I said, that is, you know, kind of an end run.
4863.22s - 4866.58s |  And a lot of times when that happens, that's when like new shit breaks
4866.58s - 4868.38s |  out or a new kind of thing.
4868.38s - 4873.26s |  Like, you know, that like hip hop and punk and EDM, that's all a turning
4873.26s - 4874.98s |  point response to, you know what I mean?
4874.98s - 4876.02s |  A change in culture.
4876.30s - 4879.54s |  And even now I feel like there's a change in culture afoot and
4879.54s - 4881.58s |  we'll see that both in film.
4881.86s - 4883.74s |  I watch Skippity Toilet every day.
4883.78s - 4886.46s |  Like I don't watch that corny fucking movie shit.
4886.54s - 4891.50s |  I think my point being that like you can see the culture turning and in that,
4891.70s - 4895.90s |  you know, we'll see like a new evolution of, uh, of that kind of underground
4895.90s - 4899.26s |  and what form that'll take will be interesting to me, I'll be watching.
4899.82s - 4899.98s |  Yeah.
4899.98s - 4906.34s |  You know, it's, um, the way, um, the net is evolving now and the
4906.34s - 4910.30s |  concept of creativity, they're not compatible, they're not compatible.
4910.34s - 4915.62s |  Amazon, Google, um, all these massive entities that want to control every
4915.62s - 4922.10s |  single, um, uh, ingredient in the whole, uh, the whole process, that's
4922.10s - 4924.06s |  not what being creative is.
4924.14s - 4926.38s |  Um, so something is going to change.
4926.38s - 4927.10s |  I don't have the answer.
4927.10s - 4930.46s |  I don't know what's going to change, but something major has to change if
4930.46s - 4934.70s |  we're going to continue to, um, encourage creative people to express
4934.70s - 4936.98s |  themselves using digital technology.
4937.02s - 4938.62s |  I see it happening myself.
4938.66s - 4943.18s |  I mean, in my practice, you know, one of my practices is, is working as a
4943.18s - 4945.82s |  futurist and with young people.
4945.82s - 4948.02s |  And I run this space in Los Angeles called R.I.P.
4948.02s - 4954.46s |  Space that is like a, it allows like, it's a hacker, hack tech media place.
4954.46s - 4958.30s |  And I have like a, a strong, um, community.
4958.30s - 4961.62s |  Like I have a bunch of friends in the cyber feminism world
4961.62s - 4964.18s |  who, uh, who curate with me there.
4964.18s - 4969.30s |  And I think like you can see the new emergence happening and stuff.
4969.30s - 4972.42s |  And it, and like I said, you can see the parts of the culture falling apart.
4972.42s - 4975.26s |  Like you were saying with the corporate thing, there's like the dead internet
4975.30s - 4977.42s |  theory, which is not really a theory.
4977.42s - 4981.14s |  You see it and media, like what, you know, just as you, you see pieces
4981.14s - 4985.62s |  disappearing because once, once it's purchased and locked the rights, they
4985.62s - 4986.82s |  could just make it disappear.
4986.82s - 4987.30s |  And that's it.
4987.30s - 4988.50s |  You don't have any ephemera.
4988.50s - 4990.50s |  You don't have any physical media.
4990.50s - 4994.22s |  Like you were saying, like with the newsletters, like a blog can just, you
4994.22s - 4997.42s |  could turn out the lights, we get to pay the bill or more importantly, yo,
4997.42s - 4999.70s |  somebody buys GeoCities and it's just gone.
4999.70s - 5002.50s |  And they're like, it's not cost effective to run it anymore.
5002.78s - 5005.58s |  And then that saps an entire part of creativity.
5005.58s - 5008.86s |  But that being said, everything's a cycle that happens.
5009.02s - 5014.50s |  Something else will begin to emerge from, from the detrius that is from that
5014.50s - 5017.22s |  particular, you know, in run of corporate mouth.
5017.54s - 5018.90s |  You come, you come back to the whole thing.
5018.90s - 5022.34s |  Like, you know, the internet interprets censorship as, as, you know, a
5022.34s - 5023.50s |  problem and routes around it.
5023.50s - 5025.98s |  Like, you know, it's the same sort of, you know, the cultural will interpret
5026.30s - 5031.54s |  commodification and, and control as, as an, as a, as a blocker and just route
5031.54s - 5031.94s |  around it.
5033.46s - 5034.38s |  Culture hacking.
5035.78s - 5038.02s |  Remember all, all the protocols are open.
5038.22s - 5039.30s |  The code is out there.
5039.42s - 5040.50s |  Build an alternative.
5041.54s - 5041.90s |  Yeah.
5043.26s - 5044.38s |  That's your homework assignment.
5045.46s - 5046.02s |  Let's do Q&A.
5046.06s - 5046.30s |  Okay.
5046.30s - 5048.74s |  I just want to say first, like we're going to, we're going to do a Q&A, but
5048.74s - 5050.70s |  also we have a very limited number.
5050.70s - 5053.30s |  I don't know if actually or any are left of the cult of the dead cow book that
5053.30s - 5054.54s |  are going to, that we have for sale.
5054.98s - 5058.42s |  Autographed by the author and a member of the seat, much of the CDC members.
5058.74s - 5061.98s |  Um, money is going, speaking of building a new network, uh, to
5061.98s - 5063.18s |  benefit the veil of foundation.
5063.42s - 5068.22s |  There's also CDC 40th anniversary challenge coins and various other
5068.22s - 5068.82s |  stuff over there.
5068.82s - 5071.78s |  If anybody's interested that, that we're selling as well as I think there's
5071.78s - 5074.66s |  still some free stickers, but there was a feeding frenzy on the stickers.
5074.66s - 5074.86s |  Yeah.
5075.14s - 5078.14s |  Oh, and also too, before you do the Q and a, you're not going to show.
5078.14s - 5080.74s |  I got, I got a little surprise.
5080.74s - 5082.30s |  Wait, I got to go to the end of the.
5083.30s - 5084.50s |  Is this a surprise job?
5086.62s - 5087.94s |  I can't see what's on the screen.
5087.94s - 5091.06s |  I'm just flipping through all the weird stuff at the end.
5091.46s - 5092.22s |  Yeah, man.
5092.22s - 5094.82s |  I mean, we need a little bit of, we talked about text files.
5094.82s - 5096.14s |  How about some real hacking?
5097.06s - 5098.50s |  A redacted document.
5098.98s - 5100.34s |  Yeah.
5100.34s - 5101.82s |  Take a look at that.
5101.90s - 5104.58s |  So one of the things, Oh, this is, this is elite.
5104.62s - 5105.22s |  This is elite.
5105.50s - 5108.46s |  So I don't know if it's on the screen, but, uh, it's still on the screen.
5108.50s - 5108.78s |  Yeah.
5108.78s - 5110.02s |  Well, why don't you read it real quick?
5110.02s - 5111.82s |  The unredacted parts, just a little bit.
5111.86s - 5115.06s |  Time of meeting place of meeting people involved.
5115.22s - 5118.54s |  The purpose of this report is to summarize the meeting that took place
5118.54s - 5123.46s |  between myself and two individuals from the redacted intelligence redacted.
5123.90s - 5128.18s |  The intent of the meeting was for the redacted to provide, am I a
5128.18s - 5132.06s |  comprehensive up-to-date training session on the techniques employed
5132.06s - 5135.06s |  to gather intelligence in this community?
5135.06s - 5138.78s |  The computer underground, Ooh, some of the more specific topics
5139.42s - 5143.70s |  included how to effectively create an alias that would produce favorable
5143.70s - 5145.94s |  results in gathering intelligence.
5147.18s - 5148.10s |  Agent steel.
5148.14s - 5148.42s |  Good.
5148.42s - 5148.62s |  Good.
5148.90s - 5149.10s |  What?
5149.10s - 5150.42s |  Not the death vegetable.
5151.70s - 5155.74s |  Buzzwords used by hackers when describing particular items like
5155.74s - 5159.82s |  where's items to be searching for when gathering intelligence from the
5159.82s - 5164.62s |  computer underground boxes, maybe, uh, techniques employed by law enforcement
5164.62s - 5168.34s |  to effectively protect their personal professional profile from
5168.38s - 5170.38s |  compromised by the hackers.
5171.18s - 5172.66s |  That's a little navel gazing there.
5172.66s - 5172.82s |  Yeah.
5175.30s - 5178.98s |  And then if you just go to the last page, what is this, this letter greetings?
5179.02s - 5179.30s |  Yeah.
5179.30s - 5183.10s |  It's, uh, it's, uh, from the mail spool at a mind box.
5186.58s - 5187.02s |  Wow.
5187.94s - 5190.86s |  Hackers, hacking, hacker, law enforcement.
5190.90s - 5197.78s |  Um, if, uh, he said he's going to nail the person that hacked the mind box.
5198.62s - 5200.02s |  So I don't think that happened.
5200.14s - 5201.10s |  Did he ever nail him?
5201.10s - 5204.26s |  I'm just curious on, on mind box.
5204.30s - 5207.26s |  But the letter from, Oh, Oh, it's Matt.
5208.18s - 5210.62s |  Oh, Matt cable system administrator.
5211.46s - 5212.30s |  Oh, no, no, no.
5212.34s - 5213.14s |  Access technology.
5213.14s - 5214.14s |  Probably did not.
5214.14s - 5215.22s |  I think he probably did not.
5216.22s - 5218.74s |  Of course he didn't nail a consulting pearl.
5219.02s - 5221.30s |  It's highly unlikely.
5223.14s - 5225.62s |  These are some folks, some very deep cuts.
5225.62s - 5229.70s |  For someone who gave you a password and said, welcome, have fun.
5230.90s - 5234.54s |  So, uh, but there are a couple of microphones, if you have a question for
5234.54s - 5238.58s |  our panel, come on up on each aisle.
5238.58s - 5241.38s |  So if you have a question, if we've got like, I think about as you can tell,
5241.38s - 5243.30s |  our panelists love to talk.
5243.30s - 5247.30s |  So let's start, let's start over here on the right.
5247.54s - 5248.86s |  It's a great text file for anyone.
5249.06s - 5253.70s |  Oh, are the mics on the Q and a mics?
5253.74s - 5253.86s |  Yeah.
5253.86s - 5255.22s |  The Q and a mics need to be on.
5255.82s - 5256.10s |  Okay.
5256.10s - 5256.54s |  Try again.
5257.10s - 5257.42s |  Hello.
5257.98s - 5258.50s |  Can you hear me?
5258.82s - 5259.14s |  Yes.
5259.46s - 5261.74s |  So, um, it's, I mean, it's interesting.
5261.74s - 5263.30s |  I've been, I think it needs to be louder.
5263.30s - 5263.54s |  Sorry.
5263.54s - 5263.66s |  Yeah.
5263.66s - 5264.02s |  Louder.
5265.38s - 5265.82s |  Hello.
5265.86s - 5266.26s |  There we go.
5266.26s - 5266.66s |  There we go.
5266.66s - 5271.58s |  Now, um, uh, I just wanted to ask you, I I've been kind of.
5272.26s - 5273.78s |  Periphery to what you guys have been doing.
5273.78s - 5279.14s |  I've been in a computer networking space since the seventies, but I wanted to ask
5279.14s - 5285.22s |  you about modern hacking, particularly with the, um, you know, the authoritarian
5285.26s - 5291.54s |  countries like Russia, China, North Korea, kind of coming into the, you know, the
5291.54s - 5295.22s |  hacking space, so to speak, just want to get your thoughts on that, you know?
5295.46s - 5299.98s |  You mean in terms of, of, uh, as nation state actors or, or people in
5299.98s - 5303.54s |  authoritarian States trying to get access to the free internet or.
5303.86s - 5306.06s |  Well, I mean, yeah, it could be that true.
5306.06s - 5311.06s |  I mean, it's impacting the culture and, and you know, what's your perceptions
5311.06s - 5314.18s |  on that whole, that, that evolution that's occurred.
5315.18s - 5316.46s |  Does anybody want to take that first?
5316.78s - 5320.82s |  Well, if one thing I'll say about that is one thing about the hacking community
5320.82s - 5321.78s |  has been really good.
5322.26s - 5327.18s |  Um, on all sides of the spectrum is the idea to be able to help people in other
5327.18s - 5331.14s |  countries, freely communicate with other countries because a lot of countries
5331.18s - 5336.58s |  authoritarian sometime, um, they want, yeah, they seek to control the conversation
5336.90s - 5341.42s |  between other countries and definitely people try to relate at with proxies or
5341.42s - 5342.14s |  different tools.
5342.14s - 5346.74s |  So that way they can get information out or get the information in for whatever
5346.74s - 5351.26s |  purpose that could be just to talk to family or, you know, if there is, you
5351.26s - 5355.90s |  know, like I said, a change in, uh, um, in, uh, you know, in, uh, in what the
5355.90s - 5357.66s |  people want from their government.
5358.06s - 5361.06s |  Um, so in that regard, the hacker community has been great and there's
5361.06s - 5364.94s |  definitely, you know, public organizations you can get involved with and there's
5364.94s - 5369.30s |  also private ones, but that part is actually a really amazing, you know,
5369.62s - 5373.86s |  smaller, not as well documented in the press, which is probably for the best in
5373.86s - 5374.14s |  a way.
5374.50s - 5378.42s |  Cause one thing is definitely nation States like to target reporters quite a
5378.42s - 5382.14s |  bit, which is another very expensive, uh, expansive topic actually.
5382.46s - 5383.02s |  But yeah,
5384.62s - 5384.82s |  yeah.
5385.50s - 5386.34s |  Next question over here.
5387.62s - 5391.74s |  Um, back in the day we had like a Commodore and if the kid messed it up,
5391.74s - 5392.66s |  you could reset it.
5392.66s - 5396.18s |  And later on we had windows and you couldn't mess with it anymore because
5396.18s - 5398.94s |  then dad couldn't do his work and had to get somebody to fix it.
5399.38s - 5400.94s |  And you could explore.
5400.94s - 5405.46s |  And now we've got webpages where you get sued because you vote, viewed the
5405.46s - 5407.22s |  source code of the webpage.
5407.74s - 5411.74s |  Uh, hacking used to be fun and educational and now it's become downright
5411.74s - 5412.74s |  dangerous.
5412.90s - 5414.02s |  So it was always dangerous.
5415.78s - 5421.66s |  It's, I think it, there was a lot of us back then that we did it even despite
5421.66s - 5422.50s |  it being dangerous.
5422.50s - 5426.30s |  And now a lot of people are afraid to even try, what can we do to help this?
5426.34s - 5430.22s |  Well, you gotta get the idiots, uh, who think they're in power out of power.
5430.22s - 5433.50s |  I think what you're referring to is the attorney general in Missouri.
5435.10s - 5438.74s |  Uh, if I'm to have this correct, the attorney general in Missouri decided
5438.74s - 5443.78s |  that viewing source code of a webpage was tantamount to committing a crime.
5444.10s - 5446.14s |  Uh, I think he threatened a reporter with jail time.
5446.34s - 5449.46s |  Look, there are people who don't get technology who don't get what we're all
5449.46s - 5450.82s |  about or they're not interested in getting it.
5450.82s - 5452.66s |  They're just using it as hammer.
5452.70s - 5453.82s |  They use fear tactics.
5453.82s - 5457.18s |  They use their own ignorance and I think that they can intimidate people.
5457.50s - 5461.98s |  And, you know, hacking has always been about, um, saying, you know, we're
5461.98s - 5462.78s |  going to do it anyway.
5463.26s - 5467.46s |  And, um, we have to, to stand by each other and, and, and not let
5467.46s - 5468.42s |  ourselves be intimidated.
5468.46s - 5470.22s |  I think for me, oh yeah.
5470.74s - 5475.30s |  Uh, for me, I view like hacking as inherently, uh, anti-authoritarian,
5475.34s - 5479.18s |  like, like, like you are breaking into a system for me, like hacking means
5479.18s - 5483.06s |  like you're doing something to a system, whether it's a computer system, a
5483.06s - 5486.66s |  cultural system, anything, whether it's Ikea hacking, whatever you are doing
5486.90s - 5491.86s |  something with a system that it was not intended to, that you were not intended
5491.86s - 5493.26s |  to do, it might be illegal.
5493.30s - 5496.14s |  I mean, Ikea hacking isn't illegal, but it's, you know, you were not that
5496.14s - 5497.34s |  you're not following the instructions.
5497.34s - 5498.62s |  You're doing it your own way kind of thing.
5498.70s - 5499.50s |  It's a mindset.
5499.54s - 5500.26s |  Yeah, exactly.
5500.30s - 5501.82s |  Hacking is an individual act.
5501.82s - 5505.38s |  I mean, you know, you couldn't say that nation states use hacking, uh,
5505.38s - 5506.98s |  abilities, use hacking skills.
5507.34s - 5510.58s |  Uh, but hackers as a rule are individuals.
5510.58s - 5513.82s |  They don't make good soldiers because they ask a lot of questions and they,
5513.82s - 5518.18s |  they think outside the box and they, they type things that they shouldn't
5518.18s - 5519.66s |  type and according to the rules.
5519.66s - 5520.10s |  Exactly.
5520.10s - 5521.54s |  So, um, something to keep in mind.
5522.54s - 5523.42s |  All right over here.
5524.14s - 5525.46s |  Uh, I have a question for the panel.
5525.50s - 5527.74s |  Uh, the guys that could you speak up a little bit?
5527.74s - 5530.50s |  I think I, uh, I have a question for the panel.
5530.50s - 5534.50s |  You spoke briefly about freaking and, and ISDN and all that kind of cool stuff.
5534.82s - 5536.62s |  Um, I'm super interested in the topic.
5536.70s - 5540.26s |  Uh, what would be a good starting point for me to dive into that, that world?
5540.58s - 5541.70s |  2,600 magazine.
5542.14s - 5543.26s |  Well, that's just one of many.
5543.26s - 5548.46s |  There are so many, um, um, books and guides and online tutorials.
5548.62s - 5550.58s |  It's hard to point to one thing.
5550.86s - 5551.82s |  Exploding the phone.
5552.26s - 5555.10s |  Lapsley has a book on this topic.
5555.10s - 5558.18s |  It's, it's, um, it's a very long book on the history of freaking called
5558.18s - 5560.10s |  exploding the phone by Phil Lapsley.
5560.98s - 5561.18s |  Yeah.
5561.18s - 5563.18s |  I think, I think it's, it's hacker approved.
5563.22s - 5564.02s |  Everybody loves it.
5564.26s - 5564.86s |  Check it out.
5565.66s - 5566.06s |  Appreciate it.
5566.26s - 5566.50s |  All right.
5569.70s - 5570.06s |  Level.
5570.26s - 5570.66s |  Oh, there we go.
5570.66s - 5574.38s |  Now we have, um, back in the day, I loved reading the books
5574.38s - 5576.18s |  about hackers in the eighties and nineties.
5576.62s - 5580.26s |  Uh, I'm curious about commentary from folks who have appeared, uh, as
5580.30s - 5585.38s |  semi fictional characters in unauthorized biographies, laud mod wars, things like
5585.38s - 5590.18s |  that, or those who have appeared as a named character in a movie, or even
5590.18s - 5595.26s |  to have in a book now where they've worked with the author, I mean, uh, I
5595.26s - 5598.82s |  can't speaking, you know, from, for the CDC book who the author of whom is
5598.82s - 5602.58s |  hiding behind his notebook right there for some men, like, you know, what I
5602.58s - 5605.86s |  would say is it is not the book that, that we would have written about CDC,
5605.90s - 5607.18s |  but we didn't write the fucking book.
5607.54s - 5610.82s |  So, uh, you know, and I think he, he did, he did write by us.
5610.82s - 5615.42s |  I think, um, largely speaking, I think, you know, uh, John might have a
5615.42s - 5617.78s |  different opinion about the, the, the MOD book.
5617.82s - 5619.78s |  Maybe you can talk about how, what that was for you.
5619.86s - 5620.26s |  Yeah.
5621.86s - 5624.02s |  Was there even a, um, a mod laud war?
5624.54s - 5625.34s |  Did that really happen?
5625.38s - 5625.74s |  Oh yeah.
5625.74s - 5626.06s |  What?
5626.34s - 5627.26s |  Did that even exist?
5627.46s - 5628.62s |  Was there a mod laud war?
5628.62s - 5629.30s |  Cyber war.
5631.06s - 5632.42s |  That's for a different session.
5632.54s - 5632.82s |  Okay.
5634.82s - 5637.70s |  And if you're referring to Emmanuel Goldstein in, uh, in the film
5637.70s - 5638.82s |  Hackers, that was a joke.
5638.90s - 5641.54s |  But I have a, oh yeah, I do have a quick story.
5641.54s - 5643.26s |  So, and, and, and a plug.
5643.26s - 5647.94s |  So I have a, uh, I'm working, I, I rep by, uh, uh, SpectraVision,
5647.94s - 5649.22s |  which is Elijah Woods company.
5649.22s - 5653.62s |  And I'm going to do, uh, one of the projects I'm going to do is a Spotify,
5654.50s - 5659.14s |  uh, based, um, uh, podcasts about hacking and stuff, you know?
5659.38s - 5662.66s |  But one of the stories that's interesting is that this guy wrote a,
5663.26s - 5666.42s |  a book, a fucking, what's it called?
5666.42s - 5668.10s |  A, a graphic novel.
5668.10s - 5672.18s |  He's a very famous graphic novelist and he wrote a story and he
5672.18s - 5675.62s |  actually lifted a lot of my story.
5675.90s - 5678.78s |  There's actually another book that, uh, the Hacker Cracker book
5678.78s - 5680.58s |  that that guy stole my story.
5680.58s - 5685.38s |  He said he was a Decepticon from Brooklyn, but yo, Decepts was over by 2000,
5685.38s - 5685.66s |  brother.
5685.66s - 5686.62s |  I was the only one.
5687.06s - 5688.70s |  Yo, why you stealing my street cred?
5688.70s - 5692.86s |  But yo, this other guy wrote this book, steals part of my story, puts it in
5692.86s - 5696.10s |  there, but didn't turn around just the other day.
5696.10s - 5701.18s |  Unfortunately he, he committed suicide and it's just such a bizarre set of
5701.18s - 5706.38s |  circumstances that like, you know, we're going to have his partner on the show.
5706.38s - 5708.10s |  I just can't believe like that.
5708.66s - 5708.98s |  Yeah.
5709.10s - 5712.42s |  And, and then, yeah, just some shit happened where he, um, wound up accused
5712.46s - 5717.70s |  of, um, um, inappropriate, um, conversations with people who are under
5717.70s - 5719.70s |  age and a sexual manner.
5719.70s - 5722.18s |  And then, you know, and, and he committed suicide.
5722.18s - 5724.10s |  So it was just weird, you know, link.
5724.10s - 5726.30s |  But anyway, I just wanted to tell that story since you had mentioned like
5726.58s - 5730.46s |  fictional stuff and you know, I see stuff sometime, like I'm like, ah, I
5730.46s - 5731.82s |  say, yo, I don't give a shit.
5731.86s - 5732.54s |  Like, you know what I mean?
5732.54s - 5736.54s |  But sometime they do, they kind of, yeah, they be stealing my shit a little too much.
5736.90s - 5738.46s |  In, in a CDC, we have a thing.
5738.46s - 5740.86s |  Like we keep track of like people who like claim they're part of the
5740.86s - 5741.66s |  cult of the cow, whatever.
5741.66s - 5743.42s |  And we, the phrase you use is stolen utter.
5743.74s - 5748.90s |  So I'm still, yeah, we get, we, we keep a list, man.
5749.74s - 5749.98s |  All right.
5749.98s - 5750.66s |  Next one over here.
5751.38s - 5753.46s |  Uh, so not so much questions.
5753.62s - 5757.26s |  Oh, not so much a question or anything.
5757.26s - 5761.06s |  Just wanted to say, this is the, my fourth con, my fourth death con, uh,
5761.10s - 5761.66s |  DEF CON.
5761.66s - 5766.74s |  And, uh, uh, this is probably my favorite panel in the four DEF CONS.
5766.90s - 5767.50s |  All right.
5771.50s - 5774.10s |  You know, I always wonder, like when I was putting in the proposal for this,
5774.10s - 5775.62s |  I'm like, is this something people give a shit about?
5775.62s - 5776.46s |  Like, it's important to me.
5776.46s - 5778.38s |  It's important to us, but I don't know whether you guys care.
5778.38s - 5780.58s |  Like I'm going to give you a little piece of my history.
5780.62s - 5787.50s |  Uh, I started hacking two to three years before you guys created CDC.
5788.22s - 5794.86s |  And, uh, my first, you know, Commodore 64, um, with the modem, I had the
5794.86s - 5800.66s |  little plugin slide modem, uh, I, I, I reserved the airline ticket for
5800.66s - 5802.82s |  Michael Jackson to fly and come to my house.
5805.18s - 5810.02s |  One of the first things I had the, the Casio phone dialer, and I used to
5810.02s - 5812.62s |  freak the hell out of my face with that.
5812.62s - 5815.98s |  So I want to say, you know, you guys gave me a flashback to the past, man.
5815.98s - 5817.02s |  That was a beautiful thing.
5817.26s - 5817.82s |  Got the book.
5817.82s - 5818.50s |  I'm going to love it.
5818.50s - 5818.90s |  Read it.
5819.38s - 5820.14s |  Thank you for coming.
5820.46s - 5821.18s |  I want to hear more.
5823.46s - 5826.02s |  I think you got one over here and then, yeah, I think we're almost out of time.
5826.02s - 5826.14s |  Right?
5826.14s - 5826.34s |  Yeah.
5826.82s - 5827.02s |  Yeah.
5827.06s - 5827.42s |  Over here.
5827.78s - 5828.70s |  Until they kick us off.
5828.74s - 5829.30s |  That's what they kick us.
5829.30s - 5829.50s |  Okay.
5829.50s - 5830.14s |  We're just going to keep going.
5830.50s - 5831.50s |  We're hacking the schedule.
5831.54s - 5833.70s |  How are we going to talk about real hacking shit?
5833.74s - 5834.58s |  You guys ready?
5834.58s - 5836.58s |  That, that just only got started.
5838.02s - 5838.14s |  Yeah.
5838.14s - 5840.94s |  I mean, like we could talk about this shit for fucking days, as you can tell,
5841.54s - 5847.06s |  so I saw a few of you have a title of archivist or part of your, your bios for
5847.54s - 5853.10s |  archivist for those that might be in the audience, like me, who might have archives
5853.10s - 5857.78s |  from the eighties and nineties, all that old crap that we have laying around on
5857.78s - 5859.86s |  floppy disks or printouts or something.
5860.30s - 5861.78s |  Is there stuff you're looking for?
5862.22s - 5863.50s |  That is an excellent question.
5863.50s - 5864.22s |  All of it.
5864.46s - 5865.22s |  Yeah, absolutely.
5865.22s - 5865.70s |  All of it.
5865.82s - 5866.10s |  Okay.
5866.70s - 5870.50s |  We should chat after, uh, I don't know.
5870.50s - 5875.14s |  I mean, I have ran an elite three disks laying around from the bulletin board that
5875.14s - 5875.66s |  I ran.
5875.90s - 5880.46s |  I mean, you definitely want to talk to Jason Scott, archive.org.
5880.50s - 5883.14s |  I mean, that's, that's good for like the, the, the media and stuff.
5883.14s - 5885.98s |  I think a bigger question that, you know, we've been talking about for years is some
5885.98s - 5889.14s |  sort of like to find an organization, a university, a museum or something that
5889.14s - 5892.14s |  would take, create like a collection based for the computer underground.
5892.14s - 5896.30s |  And I've been talking about like the need to do, you know, basically an oral history
5896.30s - 5896.98s |  of the computer underground.
5896.98s - 5898.34s |  Cause we're fucking dying, man.
5898.34s - 5902.02s |  Like literally like, you know, three, there are three CDC members who've died in the
5902.02s - 5902.90s |  last few years.
5903.30s - 5907.42s |  Um, the founder of root just passed away last year and like, these are, you know,
5907.42s - 5911.02s |  it's like, like the Blade Runner thing, you know, these are stories passing away
5911.02s - 5912.58s |  like tears and tears in the rain.
5912.58s - 5916.54s |  Like, uh, and, and for me, you know, I certainly wouldn't be the person I am if
5916.54s - 5919.38s |  it hadn't been for the hacker community and like coming up through this and like,
5919.38s - 5923.46s |  so I think this culture is important both personally and because as I was alluding to
5923.50s - 5929.70s |  earlier, it has had a massive impact on, you know, outside culture, you know, sort
5929.70s - 5931.38s |  of Normie culture.
5932.10s - 5935.86s |  But if you're looking for a clearing house, um, right now, in my opinion,
5935.86s - 5939.70s |  archive.org is doing the best job and Jason Scott has a real passion for our
5939.70s - 5941.78s |  community and has done so much.
5941.82s - 5946.02s |  He was, he, you know, the, my, the, the, the big hacker board that was a CDC board
5946.06s - 5948.86s |  that I was on was the works in, in Boston.
5948.86s - 5952.78s |  You, if you read like duo securities, like history of the loft, like that is where
5952.78s - 5955.54s |  the loft came together, was on this bulletin board on the works.
5955.54s - 5957.10s |  And it was founded by Jason Scott.
5957.10s - 5960.82s |  So, you know, he doesn't really talk about that stuff, but he was instrumental, like
5960.82s - 5966.06s |  sort of, um, by extension in bringing together a lot of the people who were then
5966.06s - 5968.22s |  instrumental in, in the hacker scene of the nineties.
5968.38s - 5971.46s |  And any remnant of geo cities that still exist today, it's because of him.
5977.02s - 5978.42s |  So, first of all, thank you guys.
5978.46s - 5984.38s |  Uh, you know, growing up with CDC text files and hope 2001, 2002, um, hugely
5984.50s - 5985.54s |  formative experiences.
5985.54s - 5986.66s |  So thank you guys for this.
5986.66s - 5988.46s |  This is a, is a big deal for me.
5989.30s - 5993.66s |  Um, we talked about, you know, hacking has always been dangerous, but which is true,
5993.66s - 5995.74s |  but you know, back in the day, they didn't really know what to do with us.
5995.74s - 5995.94s |  Right.
5995.94s - 5999.94s |  You talked about stuff was left on passworded and whatever these days you
5999.94s - 6002.30s |  really run the risk getting in somewhere.
6002.30s - 6004.50s |  They're going to, you know, throw the book at you.
6005.14s - 6010.70s |  Um, what are some things you think we can do to kind of give back, you know, uh,
6010.74s - 6016.30s |  provide hosting or something without exposing ourselves to undue risk, um, and
6016.30s - 6019.18s |  contribute to the de-shitification of being inclusive is huge.
6019.18s - 6023.74s |  Being inclusive to the people we perceive as enemies, because that's the way they
6023.74s - 6025.30s |  understand what we're all about.
6025.34s - 6029.18s |  You know, having people attend conferences like this one, seeing what hacker spirit
6029.18s - 6034.10s |  truly is, maybe they won't want to lock us up then maybe, you know, they'll listen.
6034.10s - 6035.98s |  Maybe they'll reach out to us instead.
6036.26s - 6040.02s |  You know, speaking personally, uh, what I was convicted of.
6040.06s - 6044.02s |  If that happened today, I wouldn't be around, you know, that there's just no
6044.02s - 6048.98s |  way I was treated fairly and look what I did, you know, I annoyed the hell out of,
6048.98s - 6051.90s |  uh, uh, the, the powers that be for, for four decades.
6052.30s - 6057.06s |  Um, so, you know, it's, um, if, if you treat people, right.
6057.06s - 6059.90s |  If you, uh, listen to what they're doing, what they're saying, you'll
6059.90s - 6060.98s |  learn something from them.
6060.98s - 6062.66s |  And that, that works in all directions.
6062.78s - 6067.06s |  I mean, I think that's true, but also like there are, you know, as you, things
6067.06s - 6070.54s |  have changed in some ways, like there's stuff that I did, um, that I'm not going
6070.54s - 6073.94s |  to necessarily talk about that, that, uh, you know, I might've gotten like at the
6073.94s - 6077.22s |  time, kind of like a slap on the wrist or it might've been a, you know, something
6077.22s - 6080.86s |  that now, now, you know, it wouldn't necessarily be Gitmo, but it would, you
6080.86s - 6085.34s |  know, like I would not, it would not be a happy experience for me if today, if I
6085.34s - 6088.78s |  was busted for stuff that happened, that, you know, that what the punishment would
6088.78s - 6089.50s |  have been back then.
6089.50s - 6094.30s |  And there are kids whose lives are going to be ruined in the future if we don't
6094.30s - 6095.02s |  change this.
6095.90s - 6096.42s |  All right.
6096.62s - 6101.46s |  Well, let me, if I could jump in on that real quick, just the idea, one, one thing
6101.46s - 6106.66s |  that I think is interesting is that that question is interesting for me.
6106.66s - 6113.54s |  I would say that ultimately it is better to not have fear.
6113.54s - 6117.78s |  You should be not afraid to explore the world around us.
6117.82s - 6123.58s |  I think the first thought is to just think about, I like the idea of just blue sky
6123.58s - 6127.70s |  ideation and just being able to explore, which is the heart of the hacker
6127.70s - 6128.34s |  community.
6128.74s - 6133.22s |  When you start erecting too many rules around yourself and guidelines, yo, you
6133.22s - 6135.70s |  just limit your own creativity.
6135.74s - 6142.02s |  Like I had a class that I taught at university and about hacktivism and one
6142.02s - 6147.94s |  of the, one of the amazing classes was called a, we, we had them ask, come up
6147.94s - 6150.62s |  with ideas how to defeat AI just on paper.
6151.06s - 6152.58s |  And they loved the class.
6152.58s - 6154.62s |  It was an amazing fucking class.
6155.34s - 6160.54s |  I would hire all of them for work on a, on a, on a contract.
6160.82s - 6164.74s |  But my point being is that it's multiple ways to think about ideas.
6164.74s - 6169.22s |  I think what happens is so many people get caught up in, in that.
6169.26s - 6173.94s |  And like I said, they never get a chance to fully explore the intellectual, you
6173.94s - 6176.18s |  know, abilities that they have.
6176.18s - 6179.54s |  And that may include exploring and finding new loopholes.
6179.54s - 6184.14s |  Like I said, just even doing it on paper or chat GPT, you know, you could break
6184.14s - 6186.06s |  chat GPT, go poison the model.
6186.06s - 6189.82s |  Maybe I'm saying too much, but the point is that, yo, no one's gonna arrest you
6189.82s - 6191.86s |  for that yet, soon, not yet.
6193.30s - 6195.70s |  There's so many domains to explore.
6196.02s - 6197.26s |  Um, um, yeah.
6197.26s - 6200.90s |  And I think, you know, you could say, be careful, but I also say, yo, sometimes
6200.90s - 6202.42s |  you just gotta get out there and do shit.
6202.78s - 6204.46s |  This is not legal advice.
6206.90s - 6207.82s |  But it's good advice.
6207.94s - 6208.54s |  It's good advice.
6208.54s - 6209.06s |  It's good advice.
6209.26s - 6209.98s |  I'm trying my best.
6209.98s - 6211.02s |  My I'm from Canada.
6211.02s - 6216.26s |  My flipper zero is illegal, but, Oh, Oh, all right.
6216.26s - 6216.66s |  Over here.
6221.18s - 6222.02s |  Hit the microphone on.
6223.42s - 6224.22s |  Oh, there's nobody here.
6224.38s - 6225.10s |  There's nobody there.
6226.02s - 6227.06s |  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
6228.06s - 6228.42s |  Test.
6228.50s - 6228.98s |  Yeah, there you go.
6228.98s - 6229.50s |  You're good.
6232.50s - 6235.46s |  I don't know what to call it, but I'm going to call it the underground fed side
6236.94s - 6241.46s |  because we did things that weren't approved of by the FBI.
6242.78s - 6243.30s |  Okay.
6244.14s - 6249.06s |  Um, one of them was even coming to DEF CON conferences surreptitiously because
6249.06s - 6252.70s |  we wanted to know how to harden a nationally secure computer, which we'd
6252.70s - 6256.18s |  signed off in blood that we did a good job, but we couldn't get a list of what
6256.18s - 6261.94s |  was vulnerable because yes, the fed, the FBI, you know, what's the list of
6261.94s - 6262.50s |  vulnerabilities?
6262.50s - 6266.58s |  Where can I get a list of vulnerabilities of an HBUX system or a Sun microsystem?
6266.86s - 6270.46s |  And he said, the only person on earth who cares about that is criminal.
6270.50s - 6271.74s |  And you're not turning criminal.
6271.74s - 6272.02s |  Are you?
6273.58s - 6275.22s |  How in the world did I harden such a system?
6276.30s - 6280.74s |  Well, I went places I wasn't supposed to go under names.
6280.74s - 6281.90s |  I wasn't supposed to be.
6282.98s - 6287.22s |  Um, I remember 12 of us went to a DEF CON conference very early in the
6287.22s - 6288.70s |  sequence and I won't list the one.
6289.78s - 6292.02s |  And the idea was, is that no feds were going to come.
6292.78s - 6294.06s |  We could recognize feds.
6294.42s - 6295.30s |  They had a contest.
6296.06s - 6296.62s |  Okay.
6296.86s - 6298.54s |  To try to recognize feds.
6298.82s - 6303.26s |  And, uh, if any one of us told on the others under mutual assured
6303.26s - 6304.70s |  destruction, we're going to alter each other.
6306.34s - 6307.42s |  You get all the t-shirts that way.
6307.62s - 6308.10s |  Well, yeah.
6308.10s - 6313.02s |  So, so mutual is sure destruction of our careers was the deal.
6313.58s - 6316.82s |  So we just went off into a side conference and talked about what was
6316.82s - 6319.26s |  vulnerable for systems so we could harden them when we got back.
6320.26s - 6324.06s |  Now I know even the movie hidden figures doesn't cover all the hidden figures.
6324.06s - 6327.90s |  I know there are a lot of ladies that did some really awesome stuff.
6328.86s - 6329.34s |  Okay.
6330.66s - 6331.94s |  Not just the ones they showed.
6331.94s - 6335.26s |  I got names and people I met, they were just amazing.
6335.50s - 6344.02s |  Um, one of them did the invention of wing flutter analysis in 1943 because
6344.02s - 6345.70s |  all the engineers went to war.
6345.78s - 6348.70s |  So she was not a Rosie of the river.
6348.70s - 6352.14s |  She was a wing flutter analysis designer.
6353.78s - 6356.22s |  She went into computer programming in the 1960s.
6357.22s - 6366.14s |  Um, but I'm a decriminalization of hacking and the whole concept that
6366.14s - 6375.26s |  vulnerability, uncovery, disclosure, express exploration, uh, cleanup
6375.74s - 6380.06s |  limitation should be normal and it's okay.
6380.38s - 6384.62s |  And it's the idea of what's called what we now call a security researcher.
6385.14s - 6385.66s |  Right.
6386.46s - 6387.70s |  So that that's okay.
6387.82s - 6388.82s |  That's legal.
6388.98s - 6390.10s |  That's fine.
6390.18s - 6391.42s |  That's normal.
6391.94s - 6399.10s |  Um, we, uh, we did complaints to the FBI.
6399.18s - 6401.10s |  Like there was no tomorrow on that one.
6401.22s - 6401.62s |  We did.
6401.62s - 6402.34s |  We really did.
6402.62s - 6410.03s |  Um, I got into computer security because of a competing warfare exercise with a
6410.03s - 6411.87s |  toy national top secret on my hard drive.
6413.47s - 6415.75s |  I had to take out all computers, foreign and domestic.
6417.03s - 6424.07s |  To prove that I could move a secret from a top secret computer to merely a secret
6424.07s - 6427.79s |  computer, just because I wanted the computer update.
6427.95s - 6428.11s |  Yeah.
6428.11s - 6432.35s |  I mean, I think it's, I think it's fair to say that like, um, there are, could
6432.35s - 6433.55s |  you repeat that entire question?
6434.59s - 6439.11s |  Actually, sir, can you fill in the blanks in this document I have on the screen?
6439.31s - 6439.95s |  Oh, yeah.
6440.67s - 6450.79s |  Uh, unfortunately, no, I, I, I, I spent more time, um, spotting feds then, uh,
6451.19s - 6456.95s |  then, uh, uh, then attesting to the intelligence of a fed, sorry.
6457.35s - 6461.67s |  I do think, you know, you kind of raise a valid point, which is that there are
6461.67s - 6465.91s |  people working within a system that also need to, to maneuver around
6465.91s - 6467.67s |  the strictures of that system.
6467.71s - 6467.99s |  Yes.
6468.07s - 6468.27s |  Yeah.
6468.95s - 6471.27s |  But I, I know that we're almost running out of time, so I want to make sure
6471.27s - 6473.87s |  that, that these guys have a chance to, to, to get in their questions.
6475.31s - 6475.55s |  All right.
6476.43s - 6477.47s |  Oh, another microphone.
6477.51s - 6477.91s |  Okay, great.
6477.91s - 6478.23s |  Thanks.
6478.63s - 6480.67s |  First of all, thank you for coming out here.
6480.67s - 6482.99s |  I think the person to person is very important.
6483.51s - 6489.39s |  Um, so you all grew up, well, you were there when the internet was born and, uh,
6489.43s - 6495.15s |  you all had your, uh, really unique ways of thinking about information.
6495.71s - 6500.79s |  Um, and it seems like half of your energy was just getting to that
6500.79s - 6502.55s |  information when it started out.
6502.95s - 6507.95s |  And as you pointed out, now it's, it's free, it's everywhere, but you
6507.95s - 6510.35s |  also have your echo chambers.
6510.63s - 6514.47s |  You have, you get, you get a, you know, street cred for being the person
6514.47s - 6515.43s |  who found something, et cetera.
6515.55s - 6520.71s |  So, so now you have your, your echo chambers, you have your, uh, algorithmic
6520.99s - 6525.75s |  content, you have your, uh, machine learning, uh, hallucinations.
6526.35s - 6530.03s |  I just want to get your thoughts on how do you separate fact from fiction?
6530.03s - 6531.91s |  Now data is everywhere.
6532.19s - 6538.03s |  Well, speaking as the author of history of fake things on the internet available
6538.03s - 6539.71s |  wherever fine books are sold.
6540.07s - 6544.03s |  I mean, like there is no one single answer like, or, or specific thing,
6544.03s - 6545.43s |  but it's critical thinking, man.
6545.43s - 6550.07s |  It's like, uh, you know, being able to, being sure to assess everything
6550.07s - 6553.43s |  critically and, you know, I don't pretend to be a professor of this, but,
6553.43s - 6556.83s |  you know, it's, you know, think about, um, what the source is, like where's it,
6556.83s - 6559.63s |  where it's coming from, what the motivations might be, et cetera.
6559.63s - 6563.19s |  Like, you know, if other sources are saying the same things, et cetera.
6563.47s - 6565.91s |  And having real in-person conversations.
6566.87s - 6571.07s |  One thing, one thing that I would say about that is just, I think
6571.07s - 6573.39s |  about it like a thought problem.
6573.39s - 6578.03s |  We live in an era of like what I would call like an information atmosphere.
6578.55s - 6581.39s |  There's an amazing amount of data out there.
6581.39s - 6586.51s |  You can see every breach gets bigger and bigger and it's so much data to
6586.51s - 6588.39s |  process and there's all these tools.
6588.39s - 6594.31s |  Now in that is this like a, it's an amazing moment to figure out new tools
6594.31s - 6599.11s |  and ideas, how to move through this information atmosphere that has enveloped
6599.11s - 6605.99s |  the entire world and us, our personal, our digital selves, um, um, every, every
6605.99s - 6611.95s |  complex app or whatever webpage or fucking piece of media, it has all these
6611.95s - 6613.99s |  different layers of information.
6614.59s - 6619.51s |  So I don't, I'm just proposing back to you the idea of like thinking about it
6619.51s - 6622.23s |  that way as a way to like, to tackle it.
6622.23s - 6628.35s |  Cause in a way, in, in some ways figuring out how to navigate that, not as an
6628.35s - 6634.95s |  abstract can help you like reorient on what data is real.
6635.07s - 6639.39s |  I mean, in some ways it doesn't, there's so much misinformation and culture
6639.39s - 6642.23s |  jamming, I don't know how many people in here into culture jamming at all.
6642.63s - 6647.51s |  That's a whole other track, but the, but the idea of it, the idea that there's so
6647.51s - 6652.39s |  much voluminous information out there that you can actually get lost in your
6652.39s - 6657.91s |  own data and not able to really concentrate and make sense of your own thing.
6657.91s - 6662.95s |  There's that term about a hyper normalization and ideas about that.
6662.95s - 6666.79s |  Yo, you could actually be overloaded with information and lose yourself.
6667.31s - 6671.51s |  And I think you see that a lot in society, but it's an evolutionary
6671.51s - 6676.03s |  process as we try to figure out how to discern through the information
6676.03s - 6679.19s |  atmosphere, what's real and pull that out.
6679.19s - 6682.03s |  And in some ways it doesn't even matter if it's not real, if you
6682.03s - 6683.91s |  believe it, it's all that matters.
6683.95s - 6684.67s |  I don't know about that.
6684.95s - 6685.35s |  Whoa.
6685.35s - 6685.51s |  Yeah.
6685.51s - 6686.47s |  Check that film out actually.
6686.47s - 6689.59s |  Hyper normalization by Adam Curtis that covers like all of this and
6689.59s - 6691.51s |  Masters of Deception are in that film.
6691.71s - 6693.31s |  That we, we have, we got room for one.
6693.35s - 6693.51s |  Yeah.
6693.51s - 6697.55s |  Well, more of a, if anyone wants to catch up with us afterwards,
6697.55s - 6698.75s |  you know, we'll be around.
6698.75s - 6699.51s |  So, yeah.
6700.03s - 6700.31s |  All right.
6700.31s - 6700.79s |  Awesome.
6700.83s - 6704.31s |  So, uh, I have a comment that leads into a question.
6704.67s - 6709.59s |  So I got my start into computers, uh, with an Apple two plus in the late
6709.59s - 6713.11s |  eighties when my grandfather gave it to me and thank you.
6713.15s - 6717.31s |  Uh, he and my parents worked very hard to build a level of curiosity
6717.31s - 6718.43s |  of how things worked for me.
6718.87s - 6721.03s |  So I was naturally intrigued.
6721.43s - 6725.35s |  Uh, when I got this, I had, he gave me books of how to write, literally
6725.35s - 6727.39s |  write poker games, copying from the book.
6727.39s - 6729.19s |  It wasn't, I mean, it was literally.
6729.75s - 6732.43s |  Code with comments of this is what it does.
6732.47s - 6734.51s |  They had magazines that they would, you could order that
6734.51s - 6735.47s |  would like have people.
6735.47s - 6735.71s |  Yeah.
6735.83s - 6735.95s |  Yeah.
6735.95s - 6737.39s |  You don't, I can't find that anymore.
6737.39s - 6738.11s |  I've been looking.
6738.31s - 6742.71s |  So, um, my daughter just completed her second bachelor degree in
6742.71s - 6746.31s |  software engineering at 19 and they don't teach that style anymore.
6746.31s - 6748.27s |  And it's a, it's a lost art, I think.
6748.31s - 6750.67s |  But you take two hours typing in a program.
6750.71s - 6752.27s |  You you're vested.
6752.79s - 6753.23s |  Yes.
6753.39s - 6757.55s |  And you want to know why every line and every character works the way it does.
6758.03s - 6762.51s |  So, uh, leading into that, I have first visited my first dial up BBS in like
6762.51s - 6768.15s |  1989, uh, I was like nine years old with my Apple two plus moving forward.
6768.15s - 6769.63s |  And we are being rushed off.
6770.91s - 6775.15s |  The goons are like, we're getting, I'll be quick.
6775.15s - 6779.95s |  So in, uh, uh, 1994, I started actively going to dial up BBS is all of you
6779.95s - 6784.35s |  became legends to me as I was looking at text files, but looking at that.
6784.35s - 6788.07s |  And with my daughter coming up, she's 19, her friends, other people, how
6788.07s - 6792.59s |  would you suggest to build that in the same nostalgic learning experience
6792.59s - 6796.47s |  for the next generation so that they're mentally, emotionally,
6797.19s - 6799.07s |  spiritually engaged in the tech?
6799.27s - 6800.67s |  Who's who's her hero.
6800.71s - 6801.99s |  Who does she look up to?
6803.39s - 6803.79s |  I don't know.
6805.15s - 6809.63s |  I mean, if you can make a connection there, you know, find a role model
6809.71s - 6811.91s |  and, you know, kind of push towards that.
6811.91s - 6816.63s |  I mean, I, I I'm on stage with a lot of people that I consider role models
6816.63s - 6818.43s |  and, you know, I'm, I'm honored to be here.
6818.43s - 6823.19s |  So these are the people I look to, it was like, find that person, I guess,
6823.19s - 6825.23s |  who, who can, you know, light up the path.
6825.23s - 6829.67s |  I can't necessarily suggest that, but, you know, listen to her and her interests.
6829.71s - 6830.03s |  Yeah.
6830.31s - 6834.23s |  I was looking at the overall younger community, you know, because when I was
6834.23s - 6837.83s |  growing up, I, like you talked about, we had dial up BBS, we had to search, we
6837.83s - 6843.23s |  had to go, it was an active search, which engaged at a different level, you know,
6843.39s - 6846.71s |  but the only thing, and someone recommended this to me recently is tour,
6847.23s - 6852.71s |  not necessarily the most hospitable place to go, but you have to go on a search
6852.71s - 6854.55s |  and a hunt to actually find things you want.
6854.95s - 6858.51s |  Sometimes there is actually fun, creative, artistic sites, other things.
6859.11s - 6863.67s |  But is there, do you have any ideas or maybe you could put it, you know, if
6863.67s - 6867.15s |  this idea sinks in posts and share some ideas.
6867.35s - 6871.27s |  I've noticed kids are very interested in learning about things like old cameras,
6871.27s - 6874.55s |  old computers, things that they can get their hands on, things they can take
6874.55s - 6878.39s |  apart, things that can break and fix, answer their questions, encourage them,
6878.39s - 6885.43s |  give them books, take them to a vintage computer festivals or whatnot.
6885.71s - 6889.43s |  So it's like rebels, hacker spaces, maker spaces.
6889.51s - 6889.83s |  All right.
6890.59s - 6891.75s |  We're going to leave it there, folks.
6891.75s - 6892.95s |  You were an awesome audience.
6892.95s - 6893.75s |  Thank you.
6894.23s - 6898.27s |  Thank you for everybody stuck around, you know, thanks, man.
6898.27s - 6899.15s |  That was awesome.
