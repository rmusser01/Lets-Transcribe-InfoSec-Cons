**Career in Cyberdefense**
- Tony Sager spent 35 years at the **National Security Agency (NSA)** as a vulnerability analyst.
- His career focused on finding vulnerabilities, making sense of them, and translating that knowledge into action.
- Transitioned from mathematics and cryptography to systems and software in **cyberdefense**.
- Emphasized the importance of bridging the gap between identifying problems and implementing solutions.

**NSA and Cybersecurity**
- NSA has historically focused on **signals intelligence** and **information assurance**.
- 90% of NSA's resources are dedicated to signals intelligence, with only 10% for defense.
- Culture within NSA is influenced by the imbalance between offensive and defensive priorities.

**Lessons Learned in Cyberdefense**
- **Deep Connection**: In cyberspace, everyone is deeply connected, including adversaries.
- **Bad Guys Don't Do Magic**: Attackers have limitations and operate under their own constraints.
- **Knowing Flaws Doesn't Fix Them**: Addressing vulnerabilities requires more than just identifying them; it involves economics, incentives, and public policy.
- **Defense is About Choices**: Prioritizing actions based on impact is essential; the **Pareto principle** (80-20 rule) applies in cybersecurity.

**Information Management in Defense**
- Cybersecurity is an **information management problem**.
- Sharing information is less effective than **translating** it into actionable steps.
- **Systemic Solutions**: Problems are best solved through policy, acquisition, and configuration management, rather than solely through technical fixes.

**Offense Informing Defense**
- Insights gained from offensive operations can inform defensive strategies.
- Understanding how adversaries attack can reveal their vulnerabilities.

**Cultural Challenges and Opportunities**
- **Cultural Resistance**: Releasing NSA security guides faced opposition, primarily from the defense side within NSA.
- **Offense Wins Budgets**: Offensive operations often receive more attention and resources than defense.

**Conclusion and Call to Action**
- Tony Sager encourages collaboration and building alliances to drive solutions in cybersecurity.
- Emphasizes the importance of being part of the solution, not just identifying problems.
- Expresses optimism that the cybersecurity community can make a positive difference.
