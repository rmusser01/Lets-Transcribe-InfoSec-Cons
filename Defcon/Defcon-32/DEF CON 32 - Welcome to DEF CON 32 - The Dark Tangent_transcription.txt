0.21s - 5.21s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 just a it's what I'm trying to get at is at the end of it when you boil down DEF CON it's
5.21s - 10.45s |  community. Sense of community. People want to see each other, people want to talk to each
10.45s - 14.69s |  other, they want to share experiences and if they don't have to walk to three or four
14.69s - 23.50s |  different hotels that's awesome. So okay so I want to sort of officially start this off. I'm
26.40s - 31.42s |  dark tangent um I started DEF CON 32 years ago and over the decades it has grown and grown and
34.42s - 37.82s |  and uh and so I'm just going to give you a couple little insights that I've picked up along
37.82s - 42.82s |  the way and then send you off into the stream of the con. We have fantastic speakers, we have
45.36s - 49.30s |  great creators and I'm just going to try to orient you a little bit about kind of what's
49.30s - 54.30s |  going on. Um something you'll hear frequently is that the con is what you make of it and the
56.74s - 62.38s |  thinking here is that there's an unlimited number of things you could do. You can't do them
62.38s - 67.38s |  all. So please be okay with yourselves when you can't do it all. My big moment for this was I
70.48s - 75.48s |  think DEF CON 3 or so. DEF CON 1 I knew it all. I was there. I saw it. It was awesome. DEF CON
78.12s - 84.80s |  2 woo there's more people. This is great. DEF CON 3 after the con people are coming up to me
84.80s - 89.80s |  and saying that was great. Did you see the thing that happened? Like no I didn't see the thing.
92.50s - 99.18s |  It's my con. I didn't see the thing. It's like I'm missing out. DEF CON 4 rolls around you're
99.18s - 104.92s |  like okay I'm never seeing all the things. Like I just have to be okay with that. And then
104.92s - 109.62s |  when you make that mental shift then it's like well then I want to create more things I won't
109.62s - 115.52s |  see so I don't feel so guilty you know like I'll just be able to internalize that there's
115.52s - 120.56s |  absolutely no way in the world and then other fuckers they also will have stuff that they
120.58s - 126.12s |  don't see right and then we'll all be in the same boat together and it just kind of grew that
126.12s - 135.36s |  way. So then that's where the phrase came. It is what you make of it. If you want to be
135.36s - 142.38s |  social we try to create social experiences. If you want to be technical get at it. And so
142.38s - 146.98s |  what's going on there is let's say there's a thousand people and then years later there's
146.98s - 151.98s |  10,000 people 20,000 people. It's hard to be social with 20,000 people. So we have to figure
154.46s - 160.32s |  out a way to get you into smaller groups. So a lot of behind the scenes engineering is how to
160.32s - 166.30s |  break up large groups into sort of affinity groups, car hacking and then break that up into
166.30s - 171.70s |  like ODB hacking and now you're at a table with 10 other people doing the thing you're
171.70s - 175.34s |  interested in at that moment and now you can make friends if you're at a table with 8 or 10
175.34s - 181.68s |  people. You can do that physical security, lock picking, high security lock and now you're at a
181.68s - 188.00s |  table with 10 lock pickers. And so when people say there's too many people here it's like yes
188.00s - 192.34s |  we know that but we spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to get you to have more
192.34s - 197.18s |  personal experiences like the food court. You sit at a table. People will join you and they
197.18s - 207.18s |  will talk whether you like it or not. So that's part of it. Also we really try to instill this
207.22s - 212.16s |  thing of like ask questions. Maybe at DEF CON 1 there was a handful of people that knew how the
212.16s - 217.96s |  world worked. Not anymore. There's no way any of us can understand how any of this technology
217.96s - 225.76s |  works at any depth because the market forces have required specialisations in our careers.
225.76s - 231.72s |  You will be like 9 miles deep on some tech stack and the guy next to you has never fucking heard
231.72s - 239.42s |  of that tech stack because he's not in your area. He's in aerospace or in IOT or OT or something.
239.42s - 246.38s |  And so that's super cool because now you have licence to ask what you think are dumb questions.
246.38s - 253.30s |  So just ask questions. I'm not going to tell anybody if you ask me a dumb question. It's our
253.30s - 260.92s |  secret. And so now we're creating this environment. You get these individual experiences. You can
260.92s - 271.12s |  ask dumb questions. You can wear whatever you want. And we just want you to like so the origin
271.12s - 276.50s |  story I'm sure probably many of you have heard it but when I started DEF CON I couldn't go to
276.50s - 284.38s |  cons because they were all invite only. There was one con or two cons that weren't invite only.
284.38s - 290.84s |  No. Summer con was invite only. Ho ho con. So they were all named after seasons. Ho ho con was in
290.84s - 298.08s |  Christmas. Christmas con or Xmas con. Then there was pump con in Halloween. Summer had summer
298.08s - 304.34s |  con. And so we named DEF CON or I named DEF CON not after a season because I didn't like how that
304.34s - 311.46s |  locked me in and I wanted to make it not invite only because I had been excluded. So that meant I
311.46s - 317.00s |  had to let everybody attend. I couldn't limit it. And so that's the biggest fork in the road
317.00s - 323.54s |  that DEF CON ever had to make. Open or close. And since I'd been excluded by the open or closed
323.54s - 330.38s |  I made it open. Okay now you're open. How do you limit attendance? You can't limit attendance
330.38s - 337.95s |  because now you're rewarding type A personalities and I hate those fuckers because they get up
337.95s - 345.61s |  early. They go down their checklists. So I needed to be able to balance them out with the
345.61s - 353.15s |  type team type B. And so that's been one of our challenges right. As we grow we turned into
353.15s - 359.37s |  through those two forks in the road we became a reflection of the community. Right. If people
359.37s - 365.41s |  are complaining oh no there's too much aerospace this year. Sorry. That's the way the world's
365.45s - 371.03s |  going then. Those people decided to show up so that must mean something. It wasn't artificially
371.03s - 377.91s |  created. So sometimes when you look around you're like why are things the way they are. It's
377.91s - 388.57s |  largely the result of extrapolating some of these early decisions. One other thing I say is so I
388.69s - 397.69s |  was in college. Madonna had a documentary movie or something come out. And in it she's having
397.69s - 402.07s |  this camera follow her around everywhere. And some other celebrity wants to talk to her
402.07s - 407.77s |  privately and asks hey can you turn off the cameras. And she doesn't turn off the cameras
407.77s - 413.03s |  because she says well if it's not recorded does it even exist? Did it even happen? And it's a
413.03s - 419.15s |  famous other people have said this for years. But my first exposure to that quote was in this
419.15s - 424.77s |  Madonna documentary. And so I was like aha. I have to record the first DEF CON. Because
424.77s - 430.35s |  there's going to be people who wanted to come that didn't. So we audio record all the talks. And
430.35s - 433.89s |  now I'm trying to sell these talks. And they're in cassette tapes and I'm duping them in a
433.89s - 439.31s |  cassette tape duplicator. Not a hard drive duplicator. A cassette tape duplicator. And I'm
439.31s - 443.05s |  trying to sell these things. And I do that for about a year or two. And then the next DEF CON I
443.05s - 448.81s |  got another stack of tapes. But by the third DEF CON streaming has come along. We have real
448.81s - 454.55s |  streaming. I'm like oh yes. I am still selling these tapes. So I just encode everything and I put
454.55s - 460.71s |  it online. And I just give away the talks for free. So much less hassle. And now that became
460.71s - 470.21s |  the tradition. Just recorded and gave away all the content. Part of that was because again in
470.21s - 476.71s |  the early days there was limited access to information. There was no Google or Alta Vista. No
476.71s - 483.57s |  Amazon. No excuse me. You would spend half your energy trying to find the information. The
483.57s - 488.49s |  person that knew the answer. Another half trying to understand it. Nowadays the time for you to
488.49s - 495.07s |  reach the information is like I don't know a couple minutes. Doing a couple searches. Not the
495.07s - 500.99s |  case. And so to accelerate that in the early days we gave away all the content. Well then when we
500.99s - 507.19s |  started Black Hat, Black Hat gave away all the content. Now basically that's the norm. Every
507.19s - 514.07s |  conference at least in the hacking space gives away their content for free. And I like to say
514.07s - 520.77s |  that's a master. It's weird. It was not. It was because I was type B and lazy. I didn't want to
520.77s - 529.85s |  keep shipping those tapes. It's patched. I see it here. But I'm not getting it out of the actual
529.85s - 541.53s |  channel. I mean there's something cool being at the music concert and seeing the artist. But you
541.53s - 548.49s |  can also enjoy their music later. Same thing here. If you miss a talk you want to see, it's okay.
548.49s - 554.49s |  We'll release it. You just do what you want to do. Make a couple bullet points each day of what you
554.49s - 561.49s |  want to explore. If you get your two or three things done, victory. But don't feel bad. The other
561.49s - 572.95s |  thing is we are not an InfoSec event. We are not RSA. We are a hacking event. What does that
572.95s - 579.07s |  mean? It's one of the things the CFP review team does. It's basically our filter. When you submit
579.07s - 587.03s |  to DEF CON, one of the first questions that goes through our mind is, is this hacker? Is there a
587.03s - 593.91s |  sense of joy of discovery? Is there like a spontaneous aha moment that the speaker, the
593.91s - 598.37s |  presenter had? Oh, my gosh, that's how this chip really works? I would never have figured that
598.37s - 609.71s |  out. Unless I spilled vodka on it. And so we don't have attendees that work on Oracle million
609.75s - 618.05s |  dollar database servers. Who here has an Oracle million dollar database server? Nobody. So they
618.05s - 623.89s |  might at RSA or Black Hat. That's where they're working. Corporate environments have that stuff.
623.89s - 628.63s |  Not here. So the idea is if you're going to hear a talk, it should be with technology you can
628.63s - 632.89s |  download. The tools that people are talking about should be released. You should be able to hear
632.89s - 637.43s |  something and go and play with it. And so that means it limits our pool. We're not going to have
637.43s - 641.79s |  the cool super Oracle database hacking talk, but we'll have other cool talks that are also
641.79s - 650.87s |  accessible to you. So we start trying to choose content that is more hacker, that gives you an
650.87s - 657.51s |  idea how to think. And I had a friend, I might have told this story last year, I had a friend
657.51s - 663.41s |  that I asked him, hey, are you sending anybody to DEF CON or Black Hat this year? And he was
663.43s - 668.43s |  involved in a, let's say a part of the government that does stuff to people that don't like us. And
673.17s - 678.35s |  so I'm always curious like what his thought process is. And he said, well, no, I'm not sending
678.35s - 684.49s |  anybody to Black Hat, but I'm sending my team to DEF CON. It's like, well, that doesn't like, why
684.49s - 690.33s |  would you do that? He said, well, my guy's pretty good. I mean, they're really good. And it's
690.45s - 696.55s |  like polishing the edge of a knife, like you're honing it, sending it to Black Hat. Like they'll
696.55s - 701.45s |  get a little bit better technical skills, but I mean, hey, look, it's pretty fucking sharp. But I
701.45s - 706.43s |  send them to DEF CON to learn how to think, how to approach the problem, how to think
706.43s - 711.77s |  differently. That's more valuable to me now, right? They can sharpen their knives all day long
711.77s - 717.11s |  elsewhere. And when he said that to me, it was this aha moment because running the con, you're
717.11s - 722.53s |  very close to it. And you see all the problems. They're like in your face because everybody has
722.53s - 728.87s |  no problem telling me where all the problems are. And so I sometimes don't see the big picture.
728.87s - 734.33s |  But when somebody far away explains what they're seeing, it's like, okay, now that I understand
734.33s - 740.15s |  that, we'll do things to try to help you learn how to think differently. I mean, we were doing
740.15s - 745.25s |  that already, but it was never like up front and center. So that's super cool. And then the
745.25s - 750.79s |  final thing is we really try to support the community. That's why I said hacker. We're a
750.79s - 757.13s |  community. DEF CON is one part of the community. We've been around a long time. Maybe we're
757.13s - 760.93s |  one of the biggest cons in the community, but there are lots of communities with lots of
760.93s - 767.41s |  different like norms and behaviors. One of the things we like to do here is not stop. So we go
767.41s - 773.99s |  to 2 in the morning or so and we have music and we have all these entertainment performances.
773.99s - 778.83s |  And the hacking community is big enough. We have our own musical style, right? We've got
778.83s - 785.91s |  nerd core. And when you go to other countries or when we were doing, we did DEF CON in China
785.91s - 789.33s |  and Beijing for a couple of years. And I remember we get over there and we're like, yes, okay,
789.33s - 794.33s |  what's the music scene like in China and Beijing? Are you into rock? Is it jazz? Like what is it?
794.33s - 797.75s |  Like we've got to get people from the community. We've got to showcase people from the
797.75s - 802.89s |  community and have them play music at our parties. And they're like, oh, yes, okay, yeah, we'll
802.91s - 807.19s |  get music for the parties. I'm like, yeah, but who are they? What's the cool thing? It's like,
807.19s - 812.91s |  oh, no, we don't have that. What do you mean? It's like, well, there's nobody does that here.
812.91s - 821.91s |  Like there's no style or musical bands. Like, oh, no. What else does the community not do over
821.91s - 828.83s |  here? And so it's made me think like something is more unique here where people have created
828.87s - 835.87s |  musical genres around it. They've had enough space to express themselves to grow the community
835.87s - 841.45s |  in different ways. And a lot of the questions we got when we were in China, like a dude in a
841.45s - 846.83s |  giant fucking banana outfit would jump on stage and run around. And the Americans would be like,
846.83s - 852.63s |  oh, hey, banana guy. And they'd just keep going. And the Chinese people would be like, what the
852.63s - 858.05s |  hell is going on here? There's a banana on the stage. Does that mean something? And they're
858.05s - 862.99s |  looking in the program. It's like, when the banana shows up, am I supposed to do something?
862.99s - 869.03s |  It's like, no, that's just the banana guy. And we were trying to inject a certain amount of
869.03s - 876.17s |  weirdness. And it didn't go so well because they're not programmed for weird. You know, like
876.17s - 881.01s |  the question they would get is like, okay, there's a scavenger hunt. Now, what do I get? Like,
881.01s - 887.75s |  why would I do that? Why would I invest 8.2 minutes of my energy into that if it doesn't help
887.75s - 891.95s |  my career? So, well, yeah, it's not going to help your career, but you're probably going to have
891.95s - 900.29s |  fun doing it. And you can see them like really working through that. And so, the hacker spirit
900.29s - 904.33s |  and the mentality I think is universal. But the way in which people get there is quite
904.33s - 909.17s |  different, right? And we were really lucky in the States that we got a lot of time between high
909.17s - 913.31s |  school and college and having to have a career that we could screw around. Like, if I had to do
913.31s - 919.87s |  my effort I put in college in high school years, I wouldn't be a hacker. I'd be too busy. And
919.87s - 925.89s |  so, we're also really lucky the way that people got into hacking and allowed this amount of
925.89s - 930.45s |  creativity. We want you, especially I think in America, you're allowed to fail. You're supposed
930.45s - 935.65s |  to fail. If you don't fail, how do you learn? Like, we love the underdog. We love the comeback
935.65s - 941.77s |  story. And partially I think it's because it shows somebody failing and then exceeding or
941.79s - 948.93s |  succeeding. That's not such a universal story, you know, around the world. So, one of the things
948.93s - 954.77s |  we do, before I run out of time, just to explain the back story, is you'll see around the
954.77s - 960.87s |  con we have these signs up. It's our code of conduct. And it lays out what we do. The code of
960.87s - 965.49s |  conduct applies to everybody. It applies to me. It applies to everybody in the Goonsher. It
965.49s - 975.89s |  applies to you. Everybody. And the idea here is that we should respect each other and not make
975.89s - 982.33s |  people feel afraid, unwelcome, you know. So, if you don't like what someone's saying, great,
982.33s - 988.37s |  just move on. You don't have to get into a fist fight with them. But what's the natural
988.37s - 993.51s |  consequence of having a policy is you have to enforce the policy. If you don't enforce the
993.53s - 998.77s |  policy, people are watching and they'll see if we don't enforce the policy, it doesn't mean
998.77s - 1004.21s |  anything. So, then a few years later we came up with our transparency report. And you'll hear
1004.21s - 1008.55s |  this at closing ceremonies. Everything that we figured out that happened during the con that
1008.55s - 1012.45s |  violated the code of conduct policy, we'll just kind of give you a quick summation at the
1012.45s - 1019.15s |  closing ceremonies. And this is sort of a hack to make us accountable to ourselves. Because if
1019.17s - 1027.21s |  we didn't know we were going to have to report all this stuff, there's an incentive to then,
1027.21s - 1032.91s |  how would the community ever know we're actually taking their concerns seriously? Oh, yes,
1032.91s - 1040.75s |  thank you for your report. Oh, sorry, no problems this year. And so, it's kind of painful.
1040.75s - 1046.53s |  It's sad when we have serious things on the transparency report. But I also think it's
1046.53s - 1053.15s |  absolutely a healthy thing that we have to do. And we must maintain to show the community
1053.15s - 1057.39s |  that we're holding ourselves accountable. And I'm always open for ideas and rooms for
1057.39s - 1063.09s |  improvement. Because ultimately, right, the con is what you make of it. And I want you guys
1063.09s - 1069.03s |  to feel, gals, any, but you can do whatever you want. We're trying to create this experience.
1069.03s - 1077.31s |  And the other thing is, I have 35 seconds. The other thing is, the origin story of DEF CON,
1077.31s - 1083.65s |  of the speakers, was that there was so much bullshit online, or on voice bridges, about what
1083.65s - 1089.19s |  was real and what was fake, what technically worked and what didn't. You know, if you call
1089.19s - 1095.37s |  this one number and put in this code, the next phone call you make can't be traced. Like,
1095.37s - 1101.61s |  really, can't be traced. What is that number you're calling? I don't know. It's a no-tracing
1101.61s - 1107.79s |  phone number. Why does the no-tracing phone number exist? I don't know, but it's a no-tracing
1107.79s - 1113.26s |  phone number. Oh, God, I've got to find somebody from the telco to come and explain what this
1113.26s - 1119.68s |  number is. If you have a bulletin board and you put on the login page, law enforcement's not
1119.68s - 1126.18s |  allowed to log in. No law enforcement. And they create an account and they log in. That's
1126.18s - 1134.12s |  entrapment. Really? So, if the FBI's investigating you and you just put these signs up, like,
1134.12s - 1140.46s |  FBI, you must raise your hands. Identify yourself. They got to do that? Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's
1140.46s - 1147.30s |  called entrapment. I don't think that word means what you think it means. Like, Al Capone would
1147.30s - 1153.14s |  have used that somehow to his advantage. Okay, I got to find a prosecutor now. So, we got the
1154.00s - 1157.76s |  prosecutor that was prosecuting a bunch of people and she got up there and, you know, laughed
1157.76s - 1163.68s |  about that. We got people from telco. We got people from Sun Microsystems talking about how
1163.68s - 1168.68s |  exploitation and, you know, managing large systems actually worked. Hearing from the horse's
1168.68s - 1175.02s |  mouth. From the source. And that's why sometimes you'll see speakers like our next speaker,
1175.02s - 1179.92s |  previous director of the National Security Agency, General Nakasone, it's like, now you're
1179.92s - 1185.98s |  hearing from the source. These aren't people you might normally come into contact with. So,
1185.98s - 1191.16s |  that's why sometimes you see these big name VIPs. It's because we're trying to expose you to
1191.16s - 1194.70s |  people and content that you just, you might read about, but you don't normally bump into in
1194.70s - 1200.04s |  your life. And luckily, we're big enough and they're interested in us enough. They want to
1200.04s - 1204.34s |  come and meet us now. It's not just a one-way street. It's not just us wanting to know what
1204.34s - 1209.98s |  they're doing. So, with that said, thank you very much. Sorry my voice is shot. I sound like a
1209.98s - 1214.48s |  frog. Have a great time. Thank you very much. And I'll see you around.
