**Introduction to Bypass 102**
- Focus on basic **bypass remediation**
- Prerequisite: **Bypass 101**
- Explains **bypass** as ignoring the lock and exploiting door hardware or surrounding area

**Bypass Methods and Remediation**
- Emphasis on **physical security** vulnerabilities and remediation
- Compared to cybersecurity, involves a **cycle of finding vulnerabilities and patches**
- **Latch-targeted bypass**: Involves targeting a latch to gain entry
  - Remediation includes proper installation of **dead latches** and doors

**Door and Latch Security**
- Importance of **properly installed doors and dead latches**
- Vulnerabilities arise from improper installation, especially in **wooden doors**
- **Retrofits** often used to cover vulnerabilities but can be bypassed

**Handle-targeted Bypass**
- Mimics a person exiting from the other side
- Prevention involves proper door sizing and minimizing gaps
- Use of **retrofits** to reduce gaps and secure lever handles

**Deadbolts and Mag Locks**
- **Deadbolts**: Double-sided deadbolts prevent bypassing with tools
- **Mag locks** offer additional security but can be bypassed

**Security Hinges and Combination Locks**
- Use **security hinges** to prevent door removal
- Change default combinations of **button-push combination locks** and enter phones

**Enter Phones and Request to Exit Sensors**
- **Enter phones** have default master codes; change these to prevent unauthorized access
- **Request to exit sensors** can be tricked; use additional security measures

**Elevator Security**
- Avoid relying solely on **elevator floor lockouts**
- Implement additional locked doors for enhanced security

**Overall Security Practices**
- Foster a **security culture** to prevent social engineering and tailgating
- Combine **alarms, sensors, and cameras** for comprehensive security
- **Timing analysis** to respond quickly to threats

**Conclusion and Technical Difficulties**
- Apology for technical difficulties during the presentation
- Invitation to visit **The Village** for further questions and demonstrations
