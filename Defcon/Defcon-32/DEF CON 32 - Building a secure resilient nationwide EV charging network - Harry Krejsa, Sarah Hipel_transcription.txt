 Alright, good afternoon. My name is Harry Kreisa and I work at the White House
6.24s - 10.68s |  Office of the National Cyber Director. I am Sarah Heupel. I work at the Joint
10.68s - 15.94s |  Office of Energy and Transportation. And we're really excited to talk to you here
15.94s - 22.20s |  today about how our digital ecosystem is going to be a big part of our clean
22.20s - 25.44s |  energy transition and how the clean energy transition is going to be
25.44s - 29.28s |  changing our digital ecosystem. We are excited to tell you about what we've
29.28s - 34.16s |  been learning about EVs, vehicle electrification, and how those lessons
34.16s - 39.84s |  are going to inform the broader clean energy transition. And what we are doing
39.84s - 43.32s |  in government and how we're hoping to partner with you and the broader DEF CON
43.32s - 47.72s |  community to prepare that digital ecosystem for the most ambitious,
47.72s - 57.12s |  abundant, and exciting version of this transition that is possible. So we have
57.12s - 61.28s |  some early lessons from this process. You may have heard that the Biden-Harris
61.28s - 65.28s |  administration is engaging in some generational level investments in our
65.28s - 69.52s |  infrastructure, in our advanced manufacturing capacity. A lot of it
69.52s - 73.04s |  downstream from the bipartisan infrastructure law, the Inflation
73.04s - 76.80s |  Reduction Act, and the Chips and Science Act. Some of the largest clean energy
76.80s - 81.32s |  and advanced manufacturing investments in the history of the United States and around the world.
81.32s - 86.32s |  And in that process, we've started to get some early lessons from this
86.32s - 91.44s |  breakneck deployment of clean energy technologies. And that is that in many
91.44s - 97.44s |  cases, decarbonization is digitization. Clean energy technologies are often much
97.44s - 103.72s |  more technically sophisticated, interconnected, and supply chain complex
103.72s - 109.32s |  than the fossil-based analogs that they're replacing. We're thusly getting a
109.32s - 113.88s |  better appreciation for how the future that we're moving into powered by clean
113.88s - 119.84s |  energy is going to be capable of much more than just a lower carbon one. It's
119.84s - 125.48s |  going to be capable of a near zero marginal cost electricity world. A world
125.48s - 129.08s |  where we're going to be able to have software-defined grid management, virtual
129.08s - 135.08s |  power plants, and just a much more exciting, resilient, and flexible future
135.08s - 138.88s |  than could have ever been possible without those kinds of advanced
138.88s - 144.28s |  clean energy technologies. Now there's also some hurdles between here and there.
144.28s - 151.24s |  The clean energy ecosystem has a lot more new stakeholders, new entrants in it
151.24s - 155.64s |  than a lot of traditional infrastructure sectors. We're benefiting from the
155.64s - 159.40s |  dynamism and innovation of a lot of these new entrants and these
159.40s - 164.32s |  smaller organizations, but they also come without the same decades of experience
164.32s - 168.28s |  that some of the traditional infrastructure players have. Those traditional
168.28s - 171.68s |  infrastructure players often know each other, they know their regulators, they're
171.68s - 175.92s |  used to thinking in terms of threats, threats from state-bound actors, from
175.92s - 179.88s |  criminals, and they're used to thinking about how they interact with each other
179.88s - 185.08s |  in a way that the clean energy ecosystem has not had the same time to develop yet.
185.08s - 191.04s |  We have also seen that this deployment is happening at the pace and speed that
191.04s - 196.72s |  we need to tackle our climate goals, but also at a pace and speed that is faster
196.72s - 202.08s |  than a lot of traditional government mechanisms for regulatory purposes,
202.08s - 208.40s |  industry-led, and public-private standards-building processes are used to
208.40s - 213.48s |  operate that. We also know that, yes, a lot of what we're talking about today is
213.48s - 218.08s |  the dynamics in clean energy specifically, but we're entering a wave
218.08s - 223.80s |  of physical-digital convergence for our entire infrastructure. There's, as a result,
223.80s - 228.80s |  lots of parts of our critical infrastructure that were never designed to be connected to the Internet
228.80s - 233.80s |  have benefited from a sort of accidental air gap for the last few decades, and have never been
233.80s - 238.36s |  prompted to engage in the sort of technology modernization and cyber
238.36s - 242.80s |  security considerations that they're going to need to in the years ahead.
242.80s - 249.80s |  And so we have this once-in-a-generation opportunity to pull a do-over on a bunch of our critical infrastructure,
249.80s - 255.80s |  to use the clean energy transition as an opportunity to rethink how we build
255.80s - 260.80s |  the very foundations of a lot of our society so that it is more capable of
260.80s - 265.80s |  that secure, resilient future while being a lower-carbon MARAC.
265.80s - 270.80s |  And one of the places in our infrastructure where this is most clear
270.80s - 275.80s |  and these dynamics are most prominent is in electric vehicle technology.
275.80s - 279.80s |  I'm going to let my colleague, Sarah, tell you a bit more about that.
279.80s - 287.80s |  Great, thank you. Okay, so in a moment, I'm going to tell you a bit more about the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation.
287.80s - 293.80s |  But to begin with, I want to start from the start, which is that transportation is a leading
293.80s - 300.80s |  greenhouse gas emitting sector, and all of that is led by light-conveying vehicles,
300.80s - 305.80s |  followed by medium-to-heavy-duty vehicles. And I think it's fair to say that the federal government,
305.80s - 310.80s |  and in this case, the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, and the White House,
310.80s - 316.80s |  is fundamentally, foundationally committed to reducing and eliminating those emissions.
316.80s - 321.80s |  The sales of fully electric and hybrid vehicles are going up.
321.80s - 327.80s |  They're starting to approximate the high-P curve, and that is a big part of transitioning
327.80s - 332.80s |  to cleaner transportation. Cleaner energy is part of that.
332.80s - 337.80s |  In my office, the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation is the technical lead
337.80s - 341.80s |  on the infrastructure build-out that's behind that.
341.80s - 348.80s |  So, a bit more on the Joint Office. We came into being from the bipartisan infrastructure law.
348.80s - 354.80s |  We like to say that we're the startup of government, but I'm from startups, and that's not true.
355.80s - 362.80s |  We are doing government differently, though, and I will say that the focus on affordable, reliable, convenient,
362.80s - 370.80s |  equitable, and safe is a real thing. We are very focused on that, and we are pretty nimble and dynamic.
370.80s - 375.80s |  So, the Joint Office brought in a number of people from the private sector, myself included,
375.80s - 382.80s |  and I am fortunate enough to serve as the lead of engineering for standards, reliability, and cybersecurity.
382.80s - 386.80s |  I have excellent principals, like my principal, Brendan Harris, for cybersecurity,
386.80s - 391.80s |  as well as other folks I've been able to pull in from the private sector in national labs
391.80s - 393.80s |  and other areas of government.
393.80s - 399.80s |  The EV charging ecosystem does have a multiplicity of interdependencies.
399.80s - 404.80s |  It is, I'm sure, old to deal with that for some areas of government.
404.80s - 408.80s |  This is new for this area of government. We'll talk more about that.
408.80s - 413.80s |  The private sector has been trying to crack this nut for a while, but if you're in the automotive area,
413.80s - 415.80s |  you know probably a bit about electric vehicles.
415.80s - 421.80s |  You know that there's the auto manufacturers, there's the EV charging station manufacturers,
421.80s - 426.80s |  network operators, application developers, security, operational security,
426.80s - 429.80s |  and then, of course, there's a tie-in to the utility grid.
429.80s - 437.80s |  Add to that the layer cake, basically, of government from city to state, municipal, tribal, federal.
437.80s - 440.80s |  There's a lot of layers that are happening in this.
440.80s - 443.80s |  So what the joint office is doing is two things.
443.80s - 452.80s |  We are the center of gravity for security and cyber-physical security around the charging infrastructure,
452.80s - 460.80s |  and then we are also seeking to create a web of interconnectedness amongst all these devices and all these players.
460.80s - 464.80s |  It's interoperability, it's reliability, it's security by design.
464.80s - 470.80s |  It's all the principles we cherish from the private sector, from what you all are experts on,
470.80s - 474.80s |  and we're bringing them into the federal government. Just checking my timer.
474.80s - 479.80s |  Okay, so unique infrastructure, unique challenges.
480.80s - 488.80s |  As I talked a bit about, as all the headlines say, electric vehicle charging reliability has some room for improvement.
488.80s - 490.80s |  We're shooting for 97%.
490.80s - 496.80s |  I like all lines myself, but 97% is what our law is, and so that is what we're aiming for.
496.80s - 497.80s |  Some work to go on that.
497.80s - 503.80s |  I could say so much about all of our efforts there, all the funding, the Charging Experience Consortium
503.80s - 506.80s |  that I'm staying on task for cybersecurity right now.
506.80s - 514.80s |  A lot of work for interoperability, data sharing, privacy frameworks, equity, utility coordination that I discussed earlier.
514.80s - 517.80s |  But really, why does this matter?
517.80s - 527.80s |  So again, fundamentally and foundationally, we need everybody who rides and drives electric to trust the infrastructure.
527.80s - 532.80s |  They might not trust the government, they might not know how it got there, they might not know why it's there,
532.80s - 537.80s |  but what I need is for my neighbors, I'm a Detroiter, a Detroit City resident, long time.
537.80s - 546.80s |  I need for my neighbors to pull up and plug their vehicle in, for them to know their data's safe, their vehicle's safe, they are safe.
546.80s - 552.80s |  They can charge an Evert, they can charge in a blackout, they can charge in a tornado, they can trust it.
552.80s - 554.80s |  And that's what we're here to do.
554.80s - 559.80s |  We're here to help provide trust in the system, to anchor that trust,
559.80s - 566.80s |  and to support their ability to ride and drive electric no matter what's thrown at them.
566.80s - 572.80s |  So it is very connected, as I was saying, and interconnected at that.
572.80s - 575.80s |  So we have a number of different players that come into this.
575.80s - 581.80s |  I've discussed a few from automakers, EBSC manufacturers, network operators.
581.80s - 585.80s |  Obviously there's applications developers, cellular providers.
585.80s - 591.80s |  Quite a lot's going to happen with the utility grid that I'll touch on, I'll hint to, I'll allude and foreshadow,
591.80s - 597.80s |  and hopefully you'll find out more about that in the future if you'll follow along with everything we're doing.
597.80s - 603.80s |  And then there's consumer information, there's informational security and operational security,
603.80s - 609.80s |  there's privacy frameworks, and there's the ability for, when I was talking about the layer cake of government,
609.80s - 615.80s |  without going too far into it, but often when there's funding, whether it's BIL or IRA funding,
615.80s - 617.80s |  it kind of flows from the federal government.
617.80s - 623.80s |  They give it to states or they give it to cities and municipalities for different types of programming,
623.80s - 628.80s |  and then those entities select their suppliers and those suppliers execute.
628.80s - 632.80s |  And the entities, whether they're cities or states or whatever level of government,
632.80s - 637.80s |  they need to be able to understand what they're procuring from their suppliers,
637.80s - 643.80s |  ensure excellence in what they're getting from the suppliers, the equipment, the services being rendered,
643.80s - 647.80s |  the reliability, the SLAs, they need to know what they're getting.
647.80s - 649.80s |  So a big part of that is what we offer.
649.80s - 652.80s |  We call that technical assistance in the government.
652.80s - 658.80s |  I'll talk a little bit more about the types of technical assistance we offer to make sure that underpinning,
658.80s - 662.80s |  so everyone who rides and drives electric can trust the infrastructure,
662.80s - 668.80s |  but just want you to keep in mind there's all these parts coming together and the grid.
668.80s - 676.80s |  So this diagram is not really intended to be legible because it's complicated, and that's okay.
676.80s - 678.80s |  Complexity is great, right?
678.80s - 683.80s |  There's a number of different players that have a piece of this block diagram,
683.80s - 687.80s |  whether they're in the private sector, their utilities, or they're in the public sector,
687.80s - 693.80s |  they're in the Office of Electricity, they're the Vehicle Technologies Office, they're our partners in the White House.
693.80s - 698.80s |  So what we're figuring out across the Department of Energy and the Department of Transportation
698.80s - 702.80s |  is what the interplay and interrelatedness of this.
702.80s - 708.80s |  So when vehicles are connected to the grid or they're receiving telematic signals about grid services,
708.80s - 713.80s |  grid information, that they can trust those signals, they can trust that information,
713.80s - 716.80s |  and that the grid can trust those assets and resources.
716.80s - 718.80s |  And it's not just vehicles.
718.80s - 721.80s |  There's other linchpin technologies, right?
721.80s - 725.80s |  There's smart inverters, there's buildings, there's grid-type storage,
725.80s - 729.80s |  there's a lot of distributed energy resources out there.
729.80s - 733.80s |  And the paradigm of how information flows is starting to change.
733.80s - 738.80s |  It's not necessarily just the utility issues some command and control things
738.80s - 741.80s |  and then your air conditioner does something.
741.80s - 748.80s |  We're starting to see that those end devices have minds, or at least they can communicate between each other, right?
748.80s - 752.80s |  Think like autonomous vehicles and paraphernalia communication.
752.80s - 756.80s |  That's what's starting to happen in distributed energy resources as well.
756.80s - 762.80s |  So we need to make sure that those resources are secure, they can securely and intelligently communicate,
762.80s - 769.80s |  they can bring value and a trust chain back up and have revenue-grade data
769.80s - 775.80s |  and have everything securely webbed, connected when they do start to connect to the utility grid.
775.80s - 779.80s |  So that's something that the Department of Energy and our partners at the Department of Transportation
779.80s - 782.80s |  are starting to think a lot about.
782.80s - 788.80s |  So before I turn it back over to Harry, I want to talk a little bit more about what the Joint Office of Energy
788.80s - 792.80s |  and Transportation specifically is working on.
792.80s - 795.80s |  So I come from the private sector, which I mentioned,
795.80s - 799.80s |  and I like to just keep mentioning because it's so new to me to be in the government.
799.80s - 804.80s |  And every time the Department of Energy lab person, I love them so much,
804.80s - 809.80s |  every time they say they wrote a report and somebody didn't read it and they're really upset about it,
809.80s - 814.80s |  I just want to shake them because when do you think they're going to read it?
814.80s - 817.80s |  I worked at Rivian, I worked at Ford before that.
817.80s - 824.80s |  I slept at my desk, I would bring the lamp into my desk for when the lights would go off at work
824.80s - 826.80s |  so I could keep working.
826.80s - 828.80s |  People don't have time to read reports.
828.80s - 830.80s |  That's kind of all there is to it.
830.80s - 832.80s |  There's no report reading time, unfortunately.
832.80s - 834.80s |  We're already missing our kids' baseball games.
834.80s - 837.80s |  I already don't have any hobbies.
837.80s - 838.80s |  There's no reports.
838.80s - 843.80s |  So what we need to do is create tools that make sense and that are,
843.80s - 850.80s |  I wouldn't say competitive with the private sector, but like not that look good,
850.80s - 855.80s |  that compete at the quality level of the private sector.
855.80s - 860.80s |  So one example of that is those of you from or around automotive or working automotive,
860.80s - 864.80s |  you probably know that OEMs often have pretty good security teams.
864.80s - 868.80s |  Maybe you wish it was a little more or better or whatever, especially if you're automotive.
868.80s - 871.80s |  But they're pretty good, they're pretty big, they're usually divided up.
871.80s - 875.80s |  You might even have a PKI specialized team or something fancy like that.
875.80s - 882.80s |  But when you look at EBSC manufacturers, network operators, much smaller companies,
882.80s - 888.80s |  much newer industry, they might only have 30 people that work there.
888.80s - 892.80s |  They probably do have a couple systems engineers that are like dope at cybersecurity,
892.80s - 895.80s |  but not a lot of people.
895.80s - 898.80s |  So expecting one of them to be like a master pen tester
899.80s - 904.80s |  and understand how to run a full star model or really understand how to do this,
904.80s - 909.80s |  how the bandwidth, or have the company be able to pay for a third-party,
909.80s - 913.80s |  excellent pen testing company, like the margin's not there.
913.80s - 916.80s |  So what we want to do is create tooling.
916.80s - 919.80s |  We also in my program, different world of my program,
919.80s - 925.80s |  but we have the first, the Curtin of Energy, direct contribution into open source.
925.80s - 929.80s |  We work with the Linux Foundation Everest Project, which Perry will talk about,
929.80s - 931.80s |  but we'll flash up in a minute.
931.80s - 935.80s |  So through that Everest Project in the Linux Foundation,
935.80s - 939.80s |  we are going to amend on a pen testing tool.
939.80s - 942.80s |  And what that tool would look like is say you've got a great technician,
942.80s - 947.80s |  a great systems engineer, and they'll provide like a hands-on step-by-step
947.80s - 950.80s |  of how to execute a pen test against your system.
950.80s - 953.80s |  How do you layer security? How do you look for threat layers?
953.80s - 955.80s |  How do you evaluate what you have?
955.80s - 959.80s |  How can you find improvements, whether marginal or significant?
959.80s - 964.80s |  It will give you like a step-by-step hands-on walkthrough of really,
964.80s - 968.80s |  really doing an excellent pen test for your domain, for your system specifically.
968.80s - 971.80s |  That's the kind of tooling you need to build.
971.80s - 978.80s |  Other things when I talked about, I'm like 100% less reports as a T-shirt I wear at work,
978.80s - 980.80s |  but we do need to create frameworks.
980.80s - 984.80s |  So frameworks are like the procurement language I talked about before.
984.80s - 986.80s |  The suppliers loved it.
986.80s - 991.80s |  When we put out procurement language, it was like 25 different requirements
991.80s - 995.80s |  that you should ask for for cyber and cyber security for states
995.80s - 998.80s |  when they were looking for suppliers because they're like,
998.80s - 1001.80s |  holy smokes, this is way more thorough than we thought the federal government
1001.80s - 1002.80s |  would come up with.
1002.80s - 1004.80s |  That's the kind of frameworks we want.
1004.80s - 1009.80s |  We want privacy frameworks so consumers know that their data is protected
1009.80s - 1011.80s |  at all times.
1011.80s - 1013.80s |  Data should flow, but it should be protected.
1013.80s - 1014.80s |  They should be able to opt out.
1014.80s - 1018.80s |  They should be able to have the right to be forgiven, forgotten, excuse me.
1018.80s - 1020.80s |  Theoretically, that's just Sarah's opinion,
1020.80s - 1023.80s |  but we need to be able to protect their data and their privacy.
1023.80s - 1025.80s |  So that's a framework we're working on.
1025.80s - 1027.80s |  Another is an incident response.
1027.80s - 1032.80s |  Something happens in the value chain, we should be able to know who jumps on it.
1032.80s - 1033.80s |  The supplier should jump on it.
1033.80s - 1035.80s |  Is the city involved?
1035.80s - 1036.80s |  Is the state involved?
1036.80s - 1038.80s |  Is the federal government involved?
1038.80s - 1042.80s |  Is it like an S fund where we have to go get a subcomponent manufacturer?
1042.80s - 1045.80s |  How do we know where the incident root cause is?
1045.80s - 1046.80s |  How do we take action on it?
1046.80s - 1048.80s |  Who's on first?
1048.80s - 1050.80s |  That's the kind of frameworks that we really need,
1050.80s - 1054.80s |  and that's what we're working on right now.
1054.80s - 1056.80s |  Going forward, where do we want to go next?
1056.80s - 1059.80s |  So I can't believe I made it through a whole talk,
1059.80s - 1064.80s |  and I only mentioned public key infrastructure once, I think, so far.
1064.80s - 1067.80s |  So let me mention it several more times.
1067.80s - 1070.80s |  So my favorite thing ever is public key infrastructure,
1070.80s - 1073.80s |  and we have a lot of activity around this.
1073.80s - 1081.80s |  I have this vision, this goal in life, which is to have roaming for plug-and-charge,
1081.80s - 1083.80s |  a national plug-and-charge, one might call it.
1083.80s - 1085.80s |  Perhaps you even go to Canada and Mexico,
1085.80s - 1088.80s |  and we just call it a North American plug-and-charge.
1088.80s - 1089.80s |  I think we're there.
1089.80s - 1093.80s |  So I heard the fellow earlier talking about injections
1093.80s - 1097.80s |  into ISO 15118-2 when I walked in, my favorite topic.
1097.80s - 1103.80s |  So we have 15118-2, which has PKI referenced in it,
1103.80s - 1106.80s |  public key infrastructure referenced in it.
1106.80s - 1111.80s |  It's been sort of a hot mess and a topic of heated debate and fighting
1111.80s - 1115.80s |  and infighting and outfighting for years and years and years and years.
1115.80s - 1117.80s |  But it seems like we got it together,
1117.80s - 1120.80s |  and there will be a certified trust list, it looks like,
1120.80s - 1124.80s |  and there's a number of different suppliers and North America have opted in.
1124.80s - 1127.80s |  It looks like we have the framework together.
1127.80s - 1130.80s |  So the federal government, because I love public key infrastructure so much,
1130.80s - 1133.80s |  has done quite a lot to make sure folks can trust this
1133.80s - 1135.80s |  when they ride and drive electric.
1135.80s - 1138.80s |  We've done healthy testing, supported it,
1138.80s - 1142.80s |  NREL, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
1142.80s - 1145.80s |  We then did adversarial testing against it
1145.80s - 1149.80s |  where we shared best and standard practices for adversarial testing.
1149.80s - 1152.80s |  Now we're moving on to more like firmware-based.
1152.80s - 1155.80s |  So if you have been in the industry,
1155.80s - 1160.80s |  the industry talks about state machines different than, I think,
1160.80s - 1163.80s |  the public sector and national labs who talk about a state machine.
1163.80s - 1168.80s |  So I think about this as, you know, you need to pull certificates out of your HSM
1168.80s - 1172.80s |  and pull them into your charging controller so you can run your TLS library
1172.80s - 1175.80s |  and then know to switch the vehicle from state E to B
1175.80s - 1178.80s |  to start your 15118-2 charging controller.
1178.80s - 1181.80s |  Well, every supplier on earth has to do that,
1181.80s - 1184.80s |  and it's just everybody has to do it over and over and over again.
1184.80s - 1188.80s |  If we could start creating technologies like that as a commodity
1188.80s - 1190.80s |  and releasing them into open source
1190.80s - 1193.80s |  or at least creating standard and best practices,
1193.80s - 1196.80s |  I think that'll help speed up innovation
1196.80s - 1200.80s |  and it'll help American engineering and manufacturing
1200.80s - 1203.80s |  compete better with other geographies.
1203.80s - 1205.80s |  So we're really working on getting into the weeds,
1205.80s - 1209.80s |  getting down to the module level, then at the device level,
1209.80s - 1211.80s |  then into the cloud level.
1211.80s - 1216.80s |  And I'll just make one last pitch for putting the user first in ChargeX.
1216.80s - 1221.80s |  So I do fund one of the largest consortiums within the Department of Energy
1221.80s - 1223.80s |  called the Charging Experience Consortium.
1223.80s - 1228.80s |  I won't bore you to tears with it, but it's 88 private sector partners.
1228.80s - 1231.80s |  So if you are from a company that's not a member of it,
1231.80s - 1233.80s |  we would love to have you.
1233.80s - 1235.80s |  We run three national labs,
1235.80s - 1239.80s |  and we focus on the user experience soup to nuts,
1239.80s - 1241.80s |  everything you can imagine about it.
1241.80s - 1244.80s |  And that's where it all starts, that's where it all ends,
1244.80s - 1247.80s |  equity, user experience, cybersecurity.
1247.80s - 1252.80s |  And with that, I'll have Harry to sum up.
1252.80s - 1256.80s |  So as Sarah described, we've got some big takeaways here
1256.80s - 1261.80s |  from that complex ecosystem that is becoming a more unified one
1261.80s - 1264.80s |  that is providing us this future we want to live in
1264.80s - 1268.80s |  based on creating these stakeholder groups
1268.80s - 1271.80s |  so we know how to navigate all that technical ambiguity,
1271.80s - 1274.80s |  figuring out how to get through standards and balance processes
1274.80s - 1278.80s |  in a more nimble way, making sure we're ahead of where research is going,
1278.80s - 1280.80s |  where technology is going, so we have the opportunity
1280.80s - 1283.80s |  to mitigate systemic risk along the way.
1283.80s - 1288.80s |  And in the spirit of trying to create these stakeholder communities
1288.80s - 1291.80s |  and that sense of shared strategic direction,
1291.80s - 1295.80s |  today the Biden-Harris administration is announcing its priorities
1295.80s - 1298.80s |  for ensuring the digital ecosystem is ready to deliver
1298.80s - 1300.80s |  on the clean energy transition.
1300.80s - 1302.80s |  And that includes five linchpin technologies
1302.80s - 1304.80s |  that Sarah mentioned in there,
1304.80s - 1306.80s |  which are batteries and battery management systems,
1306.80s - 1309.80s |  inverter controls, distributed control systems
1309.80s - 1312.80s |  like virtual power plants, building management systems,
1312.80s - 1314.80s |  and of course EVs and EV cybersecurity.
1314.80s - 1317.80s |  But you may notice here that three or four of those
1317.80s - 1320.80s |  first ones there are all co-residents in EVs
1320.80s - 1322.80s |  and EV charging infrastructure.
1322.80s - 1324.80s |  So there's lots of economies of scale here
1324.80s - 1327.80s |  and lessons that you can bring forward here from this process.
1327.80s - 1329.80s |  And that's why we need you.
1329.80s - 1332.80s |  That's why we need people like you in the car hacking village
1332.80s - 1335.80s |  to tear these things apart, to show us where the vulnerabilities are,
1335.80s - 1337.80s |  to make these things stronger,
1337.80s - 1340.80s |  and put many eyes and prodding keyboards on it.
1340.80s - 1343.80s |  And it's why we want you to look at open source software stacks
1343.80s - 1346.80s |  that underpin all of these technologies
1346.80s - 1349.80s |  that are going to be critical to the success of the clean energy transition.
1349.80s - 1351.80s |  We want you looking at these.
1351.80s - 1354.80s |  We want your help making sure that they're secure and resilient
1354.80s - 1357.80s |  and able to get us to that future that we all deserve to live in.
1357.80s - 1360.80s |  So please take a look at them, find those holes,
1360.80s - 1362.80s |  and let us know how to make them better
1362.80s - 1364.80s |  and make the linchpin technologies
1364.80s - 1366.80s |  and the open source software that they live on
1366.80s - 1369.80s |  possible to deliver us that future we all want and deserve.
1369.80s - 1371.80s |  Thank you.
