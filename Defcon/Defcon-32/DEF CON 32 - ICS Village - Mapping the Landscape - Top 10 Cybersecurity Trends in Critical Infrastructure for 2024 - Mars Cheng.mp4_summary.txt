**Introduction**
- Arshad from Taiwan, Search Manager of TS1 Networks, and Security Director of the Association of Hacks in Taiwan, presents the talk.

**Survey Methodology**
- The survey was conducted among CISOs in the OT industry, covering various sectors, including general manufacturing, automotive, pharmaceutical, and oil and gas.
- The scope was expanded for 2024, with an increased focus on individuals responsible for OT cybersecurity, budget management, and strategic decision-making.

**Top 10 Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Trends**
- **Policy Awareness**: An increasing number of policies and regulations related to OT and critical infrastructure cybersecurity have been implemented worldwide.
- **Human Factor**: Security awareness and training for OT operators are crucial. Phishing emails and employee actions remain common root causes of incidents, with ransomware and mobility patch management also playing a role.
- **Human Resource Gap**: There is a shortage of OT security professionals with industry-specific knowledge (e.g., semiconductor). The integration of IT and OT security teams is essential to address this gap effectively.
- **Attack Surface**: OT environments have a larger attack surface than IT due to the convergence of IT and OT, legacy communication protocols, unpatched systems, and an increasing number of devices and operations.
- **Targeted Attacks**: OT environments are attractive targets for attackers due to their critical nature and the potential for high financial gains. Ransomware remains a significant threat, with a growing number of incidents.
- **IT-OT Contingency**: The high contingency between IT and OT systems means that IT incidents often impact OT environments. This highlights the need for robust monitoring and incident response mechanisms.
- **Incident Response**: Many organizations lack the necessary tools and expertise to detect and respond to OT security incidents promptly. Third-party assistance is often required, indicating a need for improved in-house capabilities.
- **Financial Impact**: CISOs are increasingly concerned about the financial repercussions of cybersecurity attacks, including operational disruptions, productivity losses, and reputation damage.
- **Budget Allocation**: While most companies are increasing their OT cybersecurity budgets, there are variations across countries. Japan, for example, reported a decrease in budget allocation for this area.
- **Solution Deployment**: Many organizations have deployed cybersecurity solutions in their OT environments, but the coverage is not comprehensive, leaving some Windows devices unprotected. The choice of solutions is also critical, as IT-focused solutions may not meet the unique requirements of OT environments.
- **Proactive Defense**: Organizations must prioritize their OT proactive defense strategies, addressing supply chain risks, asset expansion, threat intelligence, and more. A risk-based approach is essential to focus on the most critical areas.
