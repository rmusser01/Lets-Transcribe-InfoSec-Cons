  "description": "A quarter million people die from Hepatitis C yearly, and it's getting worse. But for the first time in history there is a cure (not just a treatment) for a virus, and it is for Hepatitis C. Take one 400mg pill of Sofosbuvir every day for twelve weeks, and you will be free of the virus. The catch? Those pills are $1,000 USD apiece because the molecule is the so-called \"Intellectual Property\" of Gilead Pharmaceuticals, and they refuse to share. If you have $84,000 USD, Hep C is not your problem. We have developed a way to make the entire course of treatment for $300 USD. This methodology also applies to other diseases. Like any science, the method of manufacture of drugs can be replicated, and we are going to give you all the necessary tools and show you the process top-to-bottom. Watch it happen live, participate, and learn to do it yourself: Use our digital research assistant to help you navigate the scientific literature, get a chemical synthesis pathway, generate code for the the MicroLab to run, and watch the medicine form in the reaction chamber. Finally, press some tablets. The feds say saving a life this way is BioTerrorism. We say: So Be It.",

0.00s - 7.12s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 how many people came yesterday to thank you so much i had a great time wasn't that fun i had a
7.12s - 15.36s |  really i had a really good time so um predictably we are having uh some more av issues uh this is
15.36s - 22.08s |  restarting and we've got people who are setting up like actual sciency chemistry stuff and doing
22.08s - 31.12s |  shots over here um so yesterday we did a lot of the why uh we talked a great deal about sort of
31.84s - 40.96s |  what motivates the work and uh what we're hoping to accomplish with it today is more of the
41.84s - 49.44s |  the what and the how so uh hopefully this will pop up in a second um and when it does
50.40s - 61.36s |  um if we're lucky and a bunch of other stuff don't get in the way um we can get started um
62.16s - 65.84s |  we're going to show you the micro lab we're going to show you the online services
66.64s - 74.80s |  and we're going to show you oh and vinny's light works so so you're going to see the um
75.76s - 80.64s |  the micro lab in progress um we're going to talk about how it's put together a hardware
80.64s - 86.64s |  and software stack and additionally you're going to be able to see the online services which will
86.64s - 93.44s |  be running uh live that's sort of the problem that we're having um we will swap over to a
93.44s - 102.24s |  different machine when that happens and um i think we should be good to go here so i gotta stay close
102.24s - 114.30s |  to the mic i gotta remember that um okay dope so if you're trying to do pharmaceuticals diy
114.94s - 118.94s |  there are a number of pieces that have to happen the first thing is you have to actually do the
118.94s - 124.86s |  chemistry and the micro lab which you see being built next to me here is the system that we've
124.86s - 132.62s |  developed for helping that process and making it more automated what that allows for is that
132.62s - 137.82s |  somebody who is not super comfortable with chemistry can still participate a lot of people
137.82s - 144.54s |  look at that sort of thing and get really nervous really fast yesterday i think i likened it to the
144.54s - 149.18s |  difference between building a computer versus using a computer if you're not looking to become
149.18s - 154.14s |  a chemist but you're you you're looking to utilize chemistry somehow to do something
155.50s - 160.62s |  the skill set that you have to acquire is much less and if you have an automated system that
160.62s - 165.34s |  can help you through the hard parts and talk you through the easy parts then you can do that
166.70s - 171.66s |  antecedent to that you need to be able to write the programs that the hardware will actually run
172.54s - 177.82s |  this is the recipe press which you'll also see and this allows you to stack a procedure together
178.62s - 184.86s |  and get code into the machine so that it can execute the procedures that you want to do
185.50s - 190.38s |  antecedent to that you need to figure out what sort of chemistry you're doing you need to do
190.38s - 195.82s |  what's called retrosynthesis how do you start with a starting material and then work your way
195.82s - 200.78s |  from point a to point b and of course before that somewhere you have to actually figure out how
200.78s - 206.86s |  you're addressing your health and what you want as a drug that you want to take so let's take a
206.86s - 212.70s |  quick look at each of these here's how it kind of stacks together this is a flow chart that was sort
212.70s - 218.46s |  of put together you want to again figure out what is wrong in a medical sense that's your first bar
218.46s - 223.98s |  there then you need to figure out what the active pharmaceutical ingredient i know all of you
223.98s - 228.86s |  hackers think of something very different when we say api but api also stands for active
228.86s - 235.02s |  pharmaceutical ingredient then you develop the synthesis pathway you get a procedure for it and
235.02s - 241.18s |  then you develop a file that the machine will run you run the machine and then again at the end you
241.18s - 244.78s |  have to actually turn your active pharmaceutical ingredient into something that you can take
245.58s - 251.74s |  if it's just a white powder i mean some people might want to just snort it but like better if
251.74s - 257.42s |  you put it in a pill or maybe you put it into some sort of solution that becomes an iv drip
257.42s - 263.66s |  eventually you have to compound it some way so let's look at the automated chemistry again
264.54s - 272.26s |  chemical automation is not a new idea these are available commercially but it's closed source all
272.66s - 277.54s |  the problems that come with that of course on top of that they're ridiculously expensive
279.30s - 283.06s |  five five thousand dollars i think for like the cheapest jankiest model which is the one you're
283.06s - 289.42s |  looking at you can't even buy them if you want to pay five thousand dollars because
290.54s - 297.42s |  they're only sold to labs and you know on top of that they aren't modular they don't expand
298.14s - 303.10s |  so if you want something that does something else you need to buy the next model up you can't just
303.10s - 308.14s |  put a new module in and at the end of the day they don't work very well but you can see they're
308.14s - 314.06s |  not terribly complicated there's an inner chamber you can see this blue fluid there there's a little
314.62s - 322.06s |  teflon paddle that stirs outside there's a jacket and that is circulating a fluid that maintains
322.06s - 329.42s |  the temperature of the reaction and on top there is something injecting reagents so we don't like
329.42s - 335.82s |  all these poor features of the commercial version so here's our version again you can see it right
335.82s - 342.14s |  over here and if you'll note they're not that much different because functionally they're doing the
342.14s - 349.18s |  same thing you got something that stirs that's that inner chamber also with a blue fluid there's
349.18s - 355.18s |  a teflon little paddle that spins you've got an outer jar both of these are just mason jars
355.18s - 360.94s |  the outer jar has a circulating fluid and that circulating fluid maintains the temperature
361.82s - 368.62s |  and on the top you have peristaltic pumps which pull from those syringes to inject reagents
368.62s - 374.22s |  and then there's a little box next to it and that is the brain that executes all these commands so
374.22s - 379.82s |  let's see if we can take a look at all the bits and pieces of this uh this of course is entirely
379.82s - 386.54s |  open source you can build it yourself in fact that's the only way you can get it the documentation
386.54s - 390.62s |  team did a phenomenal job and you will get a wonderful walk through if you decide to visit
390.62s - 397.84s |  our github remember documentation or it's not a project you can make this whole thing for 300 bucks
398.40s - 401.60s |  probably less for most of you because you'll have a lot of this stuff lying around
403.52s - 408.24s |  and if you're not the sort of person who feels terribly handy you don't have to worry about it
408.24s - 414.16s |  everything either snaps together or is screw connectors this is not like a fancy difficult
414.16s - 420.40s |  project where you're gonna have to do surface mount rework or anything also there are open ports
421.12s - 426.24s |  you can reconfigure this if you want other things to happen you want to control atmosphere or you
426.24s - 432.32s |  want pressure or you want feedback from a ph meter all these things can be done because it's hackable
432.32s - 437.92s |  because if you can't rebuild it you don't own it so let's look at all the bits and pieces here
437.92s - 444.24s |  oh right and actually it works for those of you who saw what i took yesterday you know
445.20s - 453.04s |  and boy did i have the best glitter poop this morning all right let's take a look so this is
453.04s - 459.12s |  the wonderful logo and tagline for the micro lab this was an off-the-cuff statement but i thought
459.12s - 470.45s |  we should stick with it now the micro lab itself is broken down into an architecture
471.41s - 476.61s |  all of you who are the more technical will recognize these bits and pieces these i will
476.61s - 481.33s |  be able to speak to a little bit but they were all built by people who are more skilled at these
481.33s - 487.89s |  things than i am but if you can look it's not terribly sclerotic but there are a lot of different
487.89s - 495.12s |  things that are happening here's the machine itself and again you're looking at one of them
495.12s - 500.40s |  and again you're looking at one of them to the left and let's look at the pieces so
502.16s - 510.32s |  you have the reaction chamber itself this is two mason jars one which sits within the other
510.32s - 516.88s |  and there's a 3d printed armature it's called the we call it the reactor core which allows these to
516.88s - 521.36s |  screw together so that the inner jar floats while the outer jar can have the circulating fluid
522.08s - 525.12s |  this is what it looks like if you can't see super well
526.72s - 532.00s |  that piece that you see in the top that is the motor that runs the stirring paddle in the bottom
533.44s - 540.56s |  here's the actual core and it comes in three pieces and breaks apart like this snaps together
540.56s - 548.08s |  very nicely easy to construct now if you look at the rest of the armature here that purple box
548.08s - 555.20s |  houses both the circulation pumps for hot and cold fluid it also holds the peristaltic pumps
555.20s - 561.76s |  which pull from the syringes and then there's this armature that holds it all together again
561.76s - 567.92s |  this is what it looks like if you can't see super close let's take a look at the armature real quick
567.92s - 574.56s |  now for those of you who are mechanical engineering inclined you'll notice that it's asymmetric and
574.56s - 578.48s |  you might ask the question well why would that be that doesn't make a whole lot of sense was that
578.48s - 592.13s |  unintentional and yes it was intentional because our designers are awesome so now that we remember
592.13s - 600.16s |  why we're here let's put it back together and let's take a quick look at the brain now the brain
600.16s - 608.64s |  here is uh again 3d printed outside um top pops off and you can see the bits and pieces under the
608.64s - 615.68s |  hood here uh this is a version with an acrylic top again if you're close up or you come up later
615.68s - 620.72s |  you'll be able to actually see it it's sitting right here and you can see that you know there's
620.72s - 626.32s |  a bunch of wires but it's not too much to deal with and we can take a look at each of these
626.32s - 632.48s |  individual pieces so here again you can see how it's wired it's not too terribly much and a lot
632.48s - 637.92s |  of these are already ported the connectors at the top you'll see your screw terminals and these allow
638.64s - 647.60s |  us to connect the brain unit to the armature itself you have a relay board there's an arduino
648.48s - 656.32s |  that controls the pumps the main brain is a raspberry pi and then there's an interface that
656.32s - 661.68s |  is this touch screen these are really slick connectors and it makes it so that you can take
661.68s - 666.88s |  it apart and maybe you notice vinny over here who managed to put this together in 10 minutes just
666.88s - 671.92s |  from bringing it in cases this is a really easy system to use and thank you vinny wherever you are
678.99s - 686.53s |  so here you can see kind of how it's broken out you've got these nice little snap togethers the
686.53s - 694.29s |  relay board again controls a number of things there is a pid module that regulates temperature
694.29s - 699.25s |  and so you've got a heating element that's going to kick on or off as it predicts the curve of
699.25s - 704.29s |  temperature as it moves try and smooth out transitions additionally you've got something
704.29s - 710.29s |  that turns the stir motor on and off and also it's expandable there are a few other things that
710.29s - 715.57s |  you can do um i think we had a light on one of the earlier ones would have been nice in this
716.45s - 722.93s |  room with the mood lighting but um and then again uh the systems run on either 5 or 12 volts and
722.93s - 730.29s |  there's a little controller in there uh you can see also here uh this is an arduino uno and the cnc
730.29s - 736.29s |  shield that believe i said this already but that controls the pumps so those are essentially just
736.29s - 744.45s |  stepper motors and so it's pretty simple to have a g-code interpreter just send commands to say
744.45s - 748.61s |  turn it this much and one of the things that's important about this is that when you're doing
748.61s - 759.49s |  chemistry most steps in most procedures for doing synthesis say add this amount of this thing
760.69s - 766.93s |  this quickly or slowly then bring it to this temperature and stir it for this long and so
766.93s - 771.97s |  one of the things that it allows us to do is a recent update that's really great you can say
772.53s - 776.37s |  add this over this amount of time and this allows for a lot more things to be done
777.57s - 782.13s |  so looking at the bits and pieces here's how they float you can see again the touch screen
782.13s - 788.53s |  snaps into the raspberry pi on the other side you can see the arduino that has the
788.53s - 795.01s |  cnc hat on it the bottom piece is the voltage regulator and the top is the
797.33s - 803.89s |  relay control and again you don't have to build it like this one of the things that's wonderful
803.89s - 807.49s |  is that this is reconfigurable if you don't like it flat and you want a tower instead you can
807.49s - 814.37s |  totally do it the relay board you can actually even snap in between the raspberry pi and the
814.37s - 818.77s |  screen if you want but you have to have a taller box so aesthetic principles apply
819.33s - 825.65s |  remix and revisit as you see fit here you can see how the screen actually snaps in
827.01s - 833.81s |  and here's the cnc board again it's a it's a real simple little unit uh comes in a little kit and
833.81s - 839.17s |  you just snap everything together here again you can see these wonderful connectors they're really
839.17s - 844.53s |  really robust and there are a lot of wires there but you just have to count them in and screw them
844.53s - 850.29s |  down it's not um what is the term rocket surgery uh here's the voltage controller that will give
850.29s - 859.25s |  you out both uh five volts and 12 and again screw terminals for all of these things a really nice
859.25s - 867.89s |  system to work with uh i've enjoyed it so um moving forward i'll see uh this is again that
867.89s - 873.65s |  same connector and are we back all right now here you see it working now you might be able to see it
873.65s - 884.69s |  working here it is currently stirring look at that thing and just so you know this isn't just stirring
884.69s - 891.09s |  nothing both in this video and what you see here is actually manufacturing medicine and you will
891.09s - 898.21s |  watch me extract it at the end here so it's not just a demo proof of concept we've used this for
898.21s - 910.35s |  many things and it works great so i'm excited at the end and what you'll see me do soon is you'll
910.35s - 918.43s |  end up with the inner jar filled with active pharmaceutical ingredient in a solvent of some
918.43s - 925.95s |  sort and then you pour it through a coffee filter and then you let it dry and it basically looks
925.95s - 931.87s |  like this it's a fairly simple thing you dump it out you let it drip for a while now we're not
931.87s - 937.39s |  going to have time to let it dry and watch but once it does you can see there's this little powder
937.39s - 945.07s |  that's left on the bottom and then you peel it open and there's your stuff so anybody who says
945.07s - 950.43s |  you know chemistry is scary or if this sort of makes you nervous you maybe remember some weird
950.43s - 956.59s |  person in high school who abused you with like orbital theory and you know stoichiometric balancing
956.59s - 961.87s |  like yeah if you wanted to pursue a career in chemistry you might have to follow that but if
961.87s - 970.75s |  you just want to use chemistry it's not so bad so um i'm going to have to sort of walk through uh
971.71s - 975.95s |  this system uh these next two systems and then we'll swap computers and then hopefully i'll be
975.95s - 984.67s |  able to show this to you live um one of our guys has a stack of note cards and pens i will take
984.67s - 988.83s |  questions at the end but you got to write them down and then i'll collect them now this is if
988.83s - 994.67s |  you have general questions about anything we're doing and or if when i do the live thing you want
994.67s - 998.99s |  to see if we can figure out a way to synthesize your molecule choice i probably won't be able to
998.99s - 1003.55s |  do a lot of them but if somebody has a good interesting one we'll pull it down and take a
1003.55s - 1010.19s |  look okay so uh who's got the cards so look at this gentleman in the nice shirt here he'll be
1010.19s - 1015.31s |  walking around raise your hand if you want a card and write down your question so if you're trying
1015.31s - 1021.63s |  to figure out a reaction procedure and you go into the chemical literature it's difficult because
1021.63s - 1027.95s |  it's not really a procedure it's just here's how i did it so there's a lot of decoding again it's
1027.95s - 1034.83s |  not necessarily the only way to do it it might be the easy way that somebody found so it's highly
1034.83s - 1040.67s |  subjective of course it also has a bunch of jargon that if you don't have a degree in chemistry
1040.67s - 1045.71s |  might be pretty hard to deal with and on top of that you have to dig through the literature to
1045.71s - 1053.55s |  find it and one of the things that i'm super excited about is once more people start using
1053.55s - 1059.07s |  this if you say hey i figured out how to make xyz on the micro lab and you build a file for it
1059.07s - 1065.23s |  you can just trade it you can just torrent your drug of choice i mean
1067.23s - 1078.19s |  shouldn't you be able to download everything why not medicine so let's look at this wonderful
1078.19s - 1084.75s |  system that's been built this is hard let's look at the easy version this is this wonderful gooey
1084.75s - 1092.51s |  and you'll oh you may have seen this this is our uh little uh little captcha here so uh select
1092.51s - 1097.47s |  our pharmaceutical companies which have not settled for over 500 million us dollars for
1097.47s - 1103.95s |  off-label promotion and kickbacks if there are none clicks yeah yeah okay all right moving on
1105.15s - 1110.51s |  you can see there are two different types of steps here one is the dark blue that's something
1110.51s - 1115.07s |  that's actually automated that's something that the computer is doing then the turquoise
1116.19s - 1120.43s |  that is a human step so of course the machine can't load itself full of chemicals it has to
1120.43s - 1125.55s |  ask you to do that but there's a touch screen and it will talk you through that procedure it says
1125.55s - 1132.19s |  at the beginning do you have the proper ingredients do you have this much is it in the solution okay
1132.19s - 1138.11s |  load it into the proper syringe are you sure you're there and then the hard part for a human
1138.11s - 1144.27s |  which is trying not to watch the water boil while something stirs for 18 hours and making sure that
1144.27s - 1149.39s |  the temperature is just right the computer takes care of again it's a perfect division of labor the
1149.39s - 1155.87s |  way most things should be so you can see we're going to scroll through this is the procedure
1155.87s - 1159.95s |  for sovaldi this was the thing that we were talking about yesterday and you can see there
1159.95s - 1164.19s |  are plenty of automated tasks and at the bottom there's some post-processing that has to happen
1164.19s - 1169.63s |  that's done by the human that's why you see a lot of the turquoise in a row and on the right you
1169.63s - 1176.83s |  can see when a particular step is selected it has parameters and you can go through and say do you
1176.83s - 1183.79s |  want it to stir is it cooling or heating what temperature do we bring it to what degrees and
1183.79s - 1192.99s |  for how long and it's just that easy to edit again it also supports branching this is a big deal
1192.99s - 1200.27s |  because the machine is not going to know if things aren't working but the machine can ask
1200.27s - 1206.43s |  you to check so let's say and this is a fairly common thing in chemistry something just doesn't
1206.43s - 1214.27s |  dissolve right so you've stirred it in solvent for a long time it will say are there still particulates
1214.27s - 1219.71s |  and you can then tell it yes or no and if it says yes then it will continue to stir for you and it
1219.71s - 1226.51s |  says come back in another 20 minutes and let's check again so nice little linear choose your own
1226.51s - 1232.75s |  adventure and you can build branching processes again one other thing about this that i am super
1232.75s - 1239.79s |  excited about is that additionally if you have some sort of chemistry that you want to do that
1239.79s - 1244.99s |  maybe isn't so complicated and doesn't even require something as sophisticated as the micro lab
1244.99s - 1249.55s |  this still supports it if you just need something to talk you through a process
1250.43s - 1257.71s |  and have some contingencies make sure you check xyz you can still trade ideas this way so when
1257.71s - 1262.59s |  we figure things out we can tell each other and we don't even have to meet each other we can all just
1262.59s - 1270.67s |  post it and be friends because i think a lot of us remember having stuff like that when we learned
1270.67s - 1276.51s |  other things but somehow it's not out there for medicine and chemistry yet but it should be
1278.03s - 1283.07s |  so uh this is the moment when i was going to hit the hdmi switch i'm going to instead go through
1283.71s - 1287.79s |  show you the next tool and then at the end we're going to swap to the other machine
1287.79s - 1294.51s |  and we'll show the things uh live so the synthesis pathway this is the
1294.51s - 1302.51s |  the this is chemhacktica this is a system that we started in 2018 i think it's gone through
1302.51s - 1310.43s |  several iterations it's uh got a new kernel it's much more efficient and you can ask it whatever
1310.43s - 1314.99s |  you want so for those of you who have a particular chemical you'd like us to look up this is what
1314.99s - 1319.55s |  it's going to look like we're going to pull up wikipedia we're going to scroll all the way to the
1319.55s - 1327.23s |  bottom we're going to go and look for the smiles code which is an open source system for encoding
1327.23s - 1333.47s |  either both i should say both molecules and chemical reactions into an ascii string
1335.15s - 1342.11s |  you have to click on show and it pops up you grab that you copy you paste it into chemhacktica
1342.11s - 1348.35s |  and it'll draw the molecule for you in fact at the collective we use this just for either
1348.35s - 1354.35s |  generating smiles codes or drawing things it's it's got all sorts of utility and for those of
1354.35s - 1359.23s |  you who are super chemistry geeks you'll see that there are eight other modules within this as well
1360.83s - 1364.03s |  typically what happens which i'm going to show you in a moment here
1364.03s - 1367.87s |  is that you will just ask it to say what is the simplest way i can get from point a to point b
1369.15s - 1374.59s |  but there are so many parameters that you can tweak you can say do not do anything
1375.47s - 1380.43s |  that has a controlled substance as a precursor because those are hard to find
1380.43s - 1388.03s |  you can say don't use any precursors that are too expensive if you want to have safety parameters
1388.03s - 1392.83s |  and say don't use anything as a catalyst that's a heavy metal you can do that as well
1394.11s - 1402.91s |  additionally it will hypothesize if you ask it nicely but for the most part it is not doing that
1402.91s - 1407.31s |  it's looking through the chemical literature all of the chemical literature that's ever been
1407.31s - 1412.11s |  published and it's combinatorially looking for different pieces of the reaction that you're
1412.11s - 1418.67s |  trying to create so you click on perform one step and that's basically shorthand for show me the easy
1418.67s - 1425.47s |  way and when it does that it will pop up either one reaction or a series of reactions and you can
1425.47s - 1432.03s |  go in and ask it to evaluate now what you see here is that one box is in blue that's your target
1432.03s - 1437.23s |  those two green boxes that indicates that those are commercially available and you can just buy
1437.23s - 1442.03s |  them it will come up with things that are not commercially available and those boxes will be
1442.03s - 1447.95s |  red you can then click on those and say expand node which means if i can't buy this how do i
1447.95s - 1452.19s |  make that thing and if you've got something terribly complicated you may have to work your
1452.19s - 1456.83s |  way back a ways that's the thing that says tree builder it'll do all of that automatically in
1456.83s - 1464.19s |  the background if you ask it so when you click on the reaction here you see the smiles code for
1464.19s - 1470.59s |  the reaction come up and it gives you a lot of parameters you can then ask it to evaluate
1470.59s - 1477.31s |  and it will give you the solvents that you need the temperature at which it should work and again
1477.95s - 1486.43s |  how how well it expects it to work so you can get purity and yield guesses which of course
1486.43s - 1490.67s |  are dependent on conditions but it'll give you a a good guess
1492.99s - 1496.11s |  this was sovaldi this was the molecule that we were talking about yesterday
1496.91s - 1501.63s |  and just so you guys can see it again here's what it would look like if you found it in the
1501.63s - 1508.91s |  literature this is the reaction don't get too nervous if chemistry makes you nervous we're
1508.91s - 1513.95s |  starting one step here we asked it to do one step and it showed us a way to do it in one step
1513.95s - 1519.55s |  this ring of fluorines on the right with the oxygen will break off and it will leave an empty
1519.55s - 1524.91s |  space and that space where the oxygen was is going to make friends with this other oxygen on the other
1524.91s - 1532.99s |  side and yes and for those of you who remember this is indeed the thing that we were trying to
1532.99s - 1540.03s |  target um i'll also show you this uh those of you who were here yesterday saw this wonderful 3d
1540.59s - 1544.83s |  version of it but the same thing happens the ring breaks off and then there's that
1544.83s - 1550.99s |  free little stick and there's a little connection and there's your molecule
1553.39s - 1560.27s |  so let's play with this i think that uh if i'm not mistaken we're at the point where we can
1561.47s - 1566.83s |  switch over computers yeah this is this is getting into the biochemistry of sovaldi which
1566.83s - 1572.91s |  is exciting and if you want to hang out we can talk about this at the end but um i'm just going
1572.91s - 1583.55s |  to switch machines real quick and see if they play nice so the thing you're about to see if i can get
1583.55s - 1594.11s |  this machine to play nice is that this hopefully has a live net connection um i'm sorry um one of
1594.11s - 1598.75s |  my guys is out there who said he's going to help me with this so we're actually on a live net
1598.75s - 1603.39s |  connection i'm going to step out of the way while he does this we're accessing our own website
1604.19s - 1609.39s |  you're going to see it happen please don't all jump on there as well like it's live you could
1609.39s - 1616.19s |  but we don't know if it'll support 300 some odd people so just let us get through this and then
1616.19s - 1620.91s |  and then take a look everybody cool all right thank you so bear with us for a moment while we
1620.91s - 1626.43s |  try and get this thing rolling or if it's not rolling maybe my other screen is live and i can
1626.43s - 1633.20s |  talk about something else while this other computer comes back to life you guys see this
1633.20s - 1640.64s |  uh big bunch of ribbons here is that what's on there okay cool so just to talk about sovaldi
1640.64s - 1647.36s |  real quick before we take requests and look at the system in the inside there you'll see a little
1647.36s - 1655.68s |  corkscrewy thing this looks reminiscent of dna it's rna what you're looking at is part of the
1655.68s - 1664.48s |  protein that sits inside of hepatitis c thank you that allows it thank you that allows it to
1664.48s - 1671.60s |  replicate and that bright green bit that's sovaldi and the magic of it is that it comes in and it
1671.60s - 1678.16s |  binds where one of the bases from the rna is and stops the replication in its tracks
1679.12s - 1685.68s |  this is unprecedented it's amazing how it works and again it's so effective that it acts as a cure
1686.32s - 1690.80s |  rather than just a treatment it can work and your immune system can actually catch up
1690.80s - 1697.28s |  and eradicate it from your body so all right let's hope the demo gods smile on us and we're
1697.28s - 1703.52s |  gonna switch over everybody ready i can't see anybody out there there could be like three
1703.52s - 1712.18s |  people so like i need a little more is everybody ready awesome now we're talking so
1716.98s - 1721.14s |  okay i touched it all right here we go yeah i see a little jellyfishy thing
1722.50s - 1729.70s |  okay cool i lost i lost my screen well it'll all right so here we'll just do this from scratch
1729.70s - 1734.10s |  here we go so here's chemactica oh switch the tab i just minimize it where is it
1734.98s - 1742.02s |  i lost it all right never mind i'll do a fresh one here we go come on you can do it
1744.18s - 1746.66s |  maybe you can't do it we had it a second ago
1748.98s - 1757.86s |  uh dude okay i'm i'm struggling here so uh again as soon as this comes back up you'll see that
1757.86s - 1762.58s |  same screen that i showed a second ago i'm just taking this out okay there that's a little better
1762.58s - 1766.34s |  can you guys hear me better this way all right cool thanks i'm just gonna do this i'm more
1766.34s - 1774.34s |  comfortable with it i don't know how i dropped the thing so you'll be faced with a page and it'll
1774.34s - 1783.70s |  have a there it is yeah cool can you guys see it all right cool it's uh the aspect ratio is a little
1783.70s - 1791.46s |  weird but here's what we're gonna do um we're gonna grab wikipedia here and we're just gonna
1791.46s - 1798.50s |  look for your drug of choice and um again soon i'll get a stack of your requests but
1800.10s - 1803.94s |  there you go um and i'll just do sovaldi um
1808.58s - 1811.70s |  i'm typing in the dark but let's see if it'll search
1815.70s - 1819.86s |  you know this makes me so nostalgic for when i was a kid and we had
1819.86s - 1827.06s |  dial-up modems um so yeah i'm not sure how viable this is going to be at this juncture
1827.70s - 1833.14s |  um so while this is loading i'm just going to switch gears uh who has my note cards
1836.29s - 1845.39s |  okay we just passed me some sending a request to intake dash analytics wikimedia.org
1846.35s - 1857.63s |  this may or may not be a slow process but okay cool all right so um i'm gonna start with looking
1857.63s - 1865.31s |  at some of the drug requests somebody says testosterone please um yeah that's a hormone
1866.11s - 1872.19s |  doable can we synthesize estradiol i'm sensing a pattern okay
1875.55s - 1881.71s |  ah vivance somebody here was nice enough to actually point out that there are some problems
1881.71s - 1887.31s |  with this even after the patent has expired last year i still have to pay two hundred dollars a
1887.31s - 1899.55s |  month yeah that sounds fucked let's let's maybe fix that all right this one i don't know uh
1899.55s - 1905.87s |  mometasane furry treats asthma and eczema so i don't know so one thing um yesterday somebody
1905.87s - 1910.27s |  came up and asked me about monoclonal antibodies i'm sure a lot of you have seen monoclonal
1910.27s - 1917.87s |  antibodies in the news they are this miracle thing unfortunately they are too complicated
1917.87s - 1922.27s |  for us to do it's a macromolecule they're gigantic the way that you manufacture them
1922.27s - 1928.51s |  is not the same as small molecule chemistry a rough idea is if you can write it on a napkin
1929.23s - 1936.19s |  then you can probably do it over here if it's big not so much so uh
1938.43s - 1944.59s |  can you get time release capsules for slow relapse meds yes so that's in the compounding
1944.59s - 1949.95s |  phase there are plenty of um ways to do that there's some really cool stuff the
1950.67s - 1956.03s |  interestingly enough i'm going to hazard a guess this is somebody who wants adderall xl okay like
1956.03s - 1965.31s |  just maybe not but in the case that you do here is a trick the way that adderall xl is manufactured
1965.31s - 1969.47s |  is that there are those tiny little spheres that are inside the capsule and half of them
1969.47s - 1974.83s |  are coated and half of them are not coated it just means that some of those dissolve
1974.83s - 1981.71s |  instantaneously and some of them don't it is designed not just practically it is designed
1981.71s - 1988.03s |  specifically only to be the same as taking half of one and then taking the other half four hours
1988.03s - 1999.18s |  later so best time release system look at your watch can you make insulin oh my god isn't this
1999.18s - 2006.22s |  a fucker of all times man so yeah we're super angry about that one too uh insulin is something
2006.22s - 2013.18s |  you have to sort of bioproduce you can do it what we're trying to do right now actually as we speak
2014.14s - 2022.78s |  is replicate a system by which tobacco will manufacture incident endogenously now you can't
2022.78s - 2030.38s |  smoke it but you can dip it um this has been demonstrated to work we're just trying to
2030.38s - 2034.54s |  steal it because it's not commercially available but imagine you just grow some
2034.54s - 2039.98s |  tobacco in your backyard and insulin's free just like in that old tweet
2040.30s - 2048.37s |  we put it too bad do any reactions require cooling yes absolutely are you working on that
2048.37s - 2053.57s |  no we already worked on it so if you look at the machine you'll see this thing under the foil that's
2053.57s - 2058.45s |  the cooling side there are two things that circulate there's a heating module and there's
2058.45s - 2063.49s |  a cooling module often you have to keep things cool if you have an exothermic reaction that's
2063.49s - 2067.33s |  going to not be happy when it gets too hot you have to keep it cool so you will have a system
2067.33s - 2075.41s |  that has either ice and water or ice and acetone or ice and isopropyl alcohol and these will give
2075.41s - 2080.21s |  you different set points that will be able to control your temperature oh look this came up
2080.21s - 2084.85s |  all right cool is everybody cool with this and i'm sort of going back and forth and answering
2084.85s - 2089.81s |  questions as we go all right cool thank you i appreciate the encouragement again it's so dark
2089.81s - 2097.01s |  it looks like i'm here alone could you make injectable medications like insulin or humira
2098.21s - 2104.85s |  so this again is a question not so much of manufacturing of the actual molecule but in
2104.85s - 2110.69s |  terms of compounding you can make injectable meds you take that powder you can put it into
2110.69s - 2118.05s |  injectable form if you do that please be careful when you swallow a pill if it's a little dirty
2118.05s - 2123.33s |  it's not going to be that great if you take a needle that's dirty or a fluid that's dirty and
2123.33s - 2131.33s |  inject it into oh god did i break it again let's hope it comes back all right i'll need somebody
2131.33s - 2138.77s |  to log me back in um if you're compounding things for injection you have to practice sterile
2138.77s - 2143.49s |  technique now this is totally doable okay i don't want to scare anybody and say don't do it
2144.05s - 2149.57s |  be careful no be competent you can learn sterile technique but it is something that requires
2150.53s - 2157.89s |  attention here's an example right standard of practice for sterile sterility training
2158.61s - 2163.65s |  your hands don't leave your line of sight or you've broken sterility and here my hands haven't
2163.65s - 2170.21s |  touched anything and then you adjust your glasses and it's over so a real easy lot of mistakes to
2170.29s - 2181.73s |  make okay okay so that tells me i'm good benzo natate i'm gonna guess that's a like a valium
2182.45s - 2189.89s |  type thing okay yeah um i'm not sure but again if it's a small molecule probably doable somebody
2189.89s - 2198.10s |  else is asking about vivance all right cool we got more stuff all right cool a lot of people
2198.10s - 2204.18s |  asking about vivance oh modafinil if somebody just wants one now just ask me i think i have
2204.18s - 2210.18s |  one in my pocket here somewhere okay cool so let's uh so here i will skip over here and now
2210.18s - 2215.30s |  that wikipedia is making friends let's look at vivance since so many people are asking about it
2215.30s - 2223.70s |  by vans is that the correct spelling by van there's an n in there right vans by vans that correct
2224.66s - 2233.30s |  all right let's give that a try yeah okay cool all right thank you all right um
2235.30s - 2242.50s |  all right okay our hot spot apparently went down all right we've got uh more questions i am a
2242.50s - 2249.38s |  software engineer in a med school dropout how can i help contribute come say hi where are you my god
2249.38s - 2256.66s |  come make friends and like i'm serious i know that a lot of times people will come up on stages
2256.66s - 2260.66s |  like this and say no we really want help from anybody it doesn't matter your skill set we can
2260.66s - 2268.18s |  use the help i'm not lying about that seriously if you say i have no technical skills i'm at
2268.18s - 2274.10s |  defcon because somebody dragged me and i don't know how to use my smartphone but this seems cool
2274.18s - 2282.98s |  seriously come fucking say hi we need all of you no joke oh there you are yes especially you
2285.06s - 2292.66s |  all right do you have more business cards all right yes
2294.90s - 2299.62s |  but this is the important thing yes we have a bunch of business cards if you want some
2299.62s - 2304.42s |  yeah i'll pass them to you but the big deal is not that we made business cards the big deal is
2304.42s - 2310.58s |  that you can make business cards it's really really easy six dots on a piece of paper let
2310.58s - 2318.02s |  it dry and put it in a bag there is a not a person here who can't do that so you want a business card
2318.66s - 2326.90s |  come get one please make a bunch with your friends and if you have some anarchist collective or a
2326.90s - 2332.58s |  bunch of geeky friends who are hanging out somewhere and you want let me know i'll come by
2332.58s - 2337.14s |  and do a workshop and we can all just hang out at each other's houses and make abortion cards
2337.14s - 2340.98s |  does that sound like a good plan all right call me
2346.24s - 2353.71s |  ah there was a second part to this question about purity and dose determining yeah so
2354.67s - 2362.75s |  the thing that's the thing that's hard for most people who have seen modern chemistry to really
2362.75s - 2368.75s |  grok is that it's entirely possible oh we got live ants oh look at that all right cool is that you
2368.75s - 2377.71s |  don't need all the fancy machinery you know you talk to people who work in chemistry and they
2378.27s - 2386.67s |  talk about things like high-performance liquid chromatography gas chromatographs uh nmrs all
2386.67s - 2391.15s |  right so you see this milestone thing here i i think it's against crawlers but you've got to
2391.15s - 2397.55s |  click to show and then you grab it like this and if i can just doop doop doop and then let's click
2397.55s - 2408.83s |  over so here we are let's click this in here we'll do a little paste and may take a minute
2408.83s - 2416.75s |  again it's querying a machine that's very far away um but wet chemistry has been done for hundreds
2416.75s - 2420.91s |  and hundreds of years way before there were electronic machines to check our work there are
2420.91s - 2426.99s |  plenty of ways to check for purity the simplest one is called a steel tube it's a little piece
2426.99s - 2432.99s |  of glass that's a loop and then you take a tiny little thing that looks like a miniature
2434.27s - 2441.31s |  um test tube from like a dollhouse you stick it in and then you start heating it and then you'll
2441.31s - 2447.55s |  see your powder turn from powder to liquid and most things have sharp melting points and if they
2447.55s - 2454.43s |  melt at the temperature that you expect you know that it works and if it's off you can do a little
2454.43s - 2459.39s |  interpolation just a little ratio don't get scared by the math it's just a ratio seriously
2461.07s - 2465.07s |  and you can calculate your purity i'm gonna try and click and see if it'll bounce over
2465.71s - 2473.71s |  um in the meantime i will go back everybody's still cool i know this is like just so dramatic
2473.71s - 2480.99s |  we're gonna figure it out but like you know if um if you're on a regular uh net connection it
2480.99s - 2488.67s |  just pops up it takes like half a minute sometimes depending on how uh complicated okay what cad
2488.67s - 2499.79s |  software does the team use i haven't the foggiest idea um somebody knows yeah free cad all right
2499.79s - 2511.89s |  moving on um this is still working maybe i click it again here you fiddle with that okay
2512.53s - 2519.81s |  would it be different to get these equipment through airports sending or across national
2519.81s - 2530.29s |  or international borders um so this all came from very far away yeah uh east coast uh we
2531.41s - 2536.29s |  i mean not that our people aren't super experienced in smuggling they are but
2536.29s - 2540.45s |  those skills were not required for this people typically don't give you shit it's it's just a
2540.45s - 2545.33s |  bunch of computer stuff they might ask but it's not it's not that weird international
2545.33s - 2556.42s |  borders slightly different thing um i can't talk about it in public but there are maybe some war
2556.42s - 2560.34s |  zones that you've read about in the news where you've been trying to move things you can get
2560.34s - 2566.90s |  them across so we're trying to do our bit that way and if you're doing that it's doable sorry i can't
2566.98s - 2570.74s |  be more specific in public lest i be dragged away before the talk ends
2574.66s - 2581.38s |  everybody's still cool all right thank you is there a crowdsource community for tackling a
2581.38s - 2588.42s |  procedure as a group oh my fucking god there should be now here's the thing there are two
2588.42s - 2595.78s |  subreddits that are like super sleepy um i believe one's called like they both have something like
2595.78s - 2601.38s |  biohacking in the title and there's not much going on there what we would love to see happen
2601.38s - 2608.82s |  is this start now whoever wrote this question please help us start this i'm not kidding this
2608.82s - 2615.38s |  keeps me up at night because all of this stuff that we do if now don't get me wrong i am so
2615.38s - 2619.62s |  grateful that all 300 of you are here but if we are the only people who figure out how to do this
2620.34s - 2625.22s |  we've failed so please let's figure out a way to talk about it if somebody has a way to generate a
2625.22s - 2630.58s |  subreddit or just create a thread where things are popping a little more that would be spectacular
2631.86s - 2639.46s |  um any looking at ozempic wagovi fuck no you shouldn't be taking that shit leave it for
2639.46s - 2647.58s |  people who actually have diabetes i'm sorry also you don't want your retinas to detach
2647.58s - 2655.98s |  it's not a good look ah i was anticipating question this question are you still working
2655.98s - 2662.46s |  on the mouth bacteria how many people know what this is in reference to okay short answer
2663.74s - 2670.14s |  yeah it's done we still need to change one last thing but it functions properly so it's going to
2670.14s - 2676.78s |  be probably a couple of months before we actually release it and i'm getting a notion that this is
2676.78s - 2684.30s |  all toast so here's the thing go to synth.forthesvinegar.org and you can just do the
2684.30s - 2690.70s |  thing that i did and you'll see that it works it's really impressive i'm sorry i couldn't show it to
2690.70s - 2698.70s |  you live but i will answer a few more questions and mention one other thing how do you plan to
2698.70s - 2709.02s |  keep chemhactica up to date well that's a fair question um it does work within the ecosystem
2709.02s - 2715.50s |  of open source software there are we're sort of maintaining one fork the heavy lifting was done
2715.50s - 2723.10s |  by some other people um but there isn't a whole lot to update really it does crawl through a
2723.10s - 2731.10s |  database called reaxis and any time that you recompile if you use that database or i don't
2731.10s - 2734.86s |  think you even have to recompile you just have to point it to the updated version of reaxis and
2734.86s - 2747.18s |  that should do it itself um with the rise of ai oh oh would you utilize ai to make your device
2747.18s - 2755.58s |  better do you think it would make it better i mean i know mansplaining as a service is real
2755.58s - 2762.70s |  popular these days but kind of a bad look um no okay but in all seriousness we have been looking
2762.70s - 2769.42s |  at trying to build some systems that will help you navigate the scientific literature because
2769.42s - 2773.90s |  taking technical jargon and boiling it down is something that the large language models seem to
2773.90s - 2780.46s |  be good at but we've been having trouble trying to get it to work because it makes shit up um
2780.46s - 2786.38s |  oh my goodness all right i know there are still more here i i got a five minute mark let me say
2786.38s - 2800.42s |  one more thing before i step off stage here if this work seems worthwhile to you or interesting
2801.30s - 2812.90s |  or fun come join us we need your help we need it now think for a moment if i were to say somebody's
2812.90s - 2817.46s |  dying outside and you can help me save them i just need you to come with me and help me

2830.42s - 2836.82s |  just build your own figure out things that we didn't use it for procedures that we didn't
2837.54s - 2844.42s |  think of make it better make it new and teach people there's no better thing that you can do
2844.42s - 2851.14s |  as a technically adept person than to teach what you know to somebody who doesn't know it yet
2852.90s - 2858.42s |  we can make things so much better all of us together please come chat with me after
2858.98s - 2863.94s |  write to us or don't and just make it yourself thank you all so much for coming
