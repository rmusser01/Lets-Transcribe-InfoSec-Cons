**ATM Security and Vulnerabilities**

- **Increase in ATM Crime**: Over 600% increase in recent years, with ATMs holding up to $400,000.
- **Enterprise ATM Vulnerabilities**: Discovery of six zero-day vulnerabilities in Diebold Nixdorf's Vynamic Security Suite (VSS).
- **Potential Compromise Timeframe**: Malicious actors need 10 minutes or less to gain full control of systems running VSS.
- **Affected Industries**: Global presence in financial, casino/gaming, and point-of-sale markets.
  
**Technical Aspects of VSS**

- **Full Disk Encryption**: Conducts complex integrity validation during system initialization.
- **Systemic Risk**: Each vulnerability impacts all major versions of VSS.
- **Mitigation Techniques**: Insight into defending against potential compromises.

**ATM Architecture**

- **Classes of Systems**: Consumer-grade (Windows CE) and enterprise-class (Windows Embedded 10).
- **Physical Structure**: Divided into top portion (PC components) and bottom vault (cash cassettes).
- **Security Measures**: Multi-factor authentication, seismic detectors for vault; weaker security for top portion.

**Common and Less Common Attacks**

- **Black Box Devices**: Manipulate ATM requests and simulate networks.
- **Card Skimmers**: Steal card data.
- **Physical Attacks**: RAM raiding, explosive attacks (less common in the US due to paper currency).

**VSS Security Features and Weaknesses**

- **Security Features**: USB filtering, firewall policy, tamper detection, delegated access, disk encryption.
- **Encryption Limitations**: Two unencrypted partitions, including a Linux partition.
- **Vulnerability Discovery**: Connections to Cryptware CryptoPro and its pre-boot authentication process.

**Exploitation Techniques**

- **Dual-Boot System**: Uses Linux and Windows; modifications can bypass pre-boot authentication.
- **Phase Validation**: Validation of 253 elements in UEFI, 2,500 files in Linux.
- **Attack Strategy**: Identify unvalidated files to exploit in boot sequences.

**Mitigation and Vendor Response**

- **Patch Implementation**: Service releases addressing vulnerabilities, with varying degrees of effectiveness.
- **Version Changes**: Diebold Nixdorf changed version strategy, removing references to third-party integrations.
- **Future Defense Strategies**: Full encryption of the SuperSheep OS, replacing dynamic security with recognized solutions like BitLocker.

**Recommendations for ATM Security**

- **Patch Regularly**: Stay up-to-date with the latest software releases.
- **Physical Security**: Monitor top hat entry, disable unused USB ports, secure hard drive screws.
- **Configuration Checks**: Enable security configurations to reduce attack surfaces.
