**Introduction to Badge Making**
- Presented by **Cold Brew**
- **Roles**: Solutions Architect, Founder and Lead Hacker at ROT13 Labs, Organizer of High Roller Con
- Emphasizes **tinkering** and **experimentation** in hardware hacking

**Topics Covered**
- **Idea Generation**: Importance of a compelling idea for badge creation
- **Planning**: Hardware, firmware, packaging, accessories, budget
- **Disclaimer**: No single "right way" to make badges; learn from others

**Design Considerations**
- **Visual Design**: Shape, color, size, and aesthetic considerations
- **Functionality**: Determine desired features and power requirements
- **Budget Considerations**: Plan for production scale and potential costs

**Hardware Planning**
- **Basic Components**: LEDs, resistors, microcontrollers
- **SMD vs. Through-hole**: Impact on design and assembly complexity
- **Reverse Mounting**: Example of innovative LED usage

**Microcontroller Selection**
- **Options**: Examples like ATmega328P, RPi2040, ESP8266, ESP32
- **Considerations**: Processing power, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth capabilities, GPIO needs
- **Documentation**: Importance of verifying chip capabilities and support

**Power Management**
- **Battery Life**: Considerations for rechargeable vs. non-rechargeable
- **High Power Components**: Impact of NeoPixels and Wi-Fi on battery life
- **Charge Circuits**: Evaluate if necessary for chosen battery type

**Prototyping and Testing**
- **Circuit Design**: Importance of schematic drawing and breadboarding
- **Firmware Development**: Using resources like Arduino IDE for testing
- **Community Resources**: Leveraging existing code and documentation

**Packaging and Accessories**
- **Enhancing Experience**: Consideration for adding packaging and extras
- **Essential vs. Optional**: Determine what is necessary for badge use

**Sourcing and Budgeting**
- **Suppliers**: Fast shipping (Amazon), mid-tier (Digikey, Mouser), cost-effective (AliExpress)
- **Budget Planning**: Estimating costs, production quantity, and pricing strategy

**PCB Design Process**
- **Software**: EasyEDA for design and layout
- **Design Layers**: Understanding additive and subtractive layers in PCB design
- **Simulation and Testing**: Using 3D views and design rule checks

**Final Thoughts**
- Encouragement to **experiment** and create badges
- **Community Engagement**: Open invitation for questions and discussions at DEF CON
