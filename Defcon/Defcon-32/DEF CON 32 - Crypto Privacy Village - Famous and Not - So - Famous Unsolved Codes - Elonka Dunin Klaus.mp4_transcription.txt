 Welcome, everyone. Today, our last day of DEF CON, congratulations on surviving.
8.24s - 16.16s |  We're going to be talking about famous and not so famous unsolved codes. So I am Ilan Kadunin,
16.16s - 22.00s |  and I am a game developer and a crypto authority and a book author and...
22.56s - 28.48s |  Hello, I'm Klaus Schmee. I'm a German IT security expert, crypto expert,
28.48s - 34.56s |  crypto history expert and book author. Right. And together we wrote a couple books,
35.28s - 42.24s |  one of which is Codebreaking, a practical guide, which I believe is sold out in the vendor hall
42.24s - 47.52s |  right now. They might have like one copy left. And it came out in September of last year. So
47.52s - 53.28s |  we're going to be going through a very small number of unsolved encrypted messages,
54.16s - 65.65s |  starting with one of my favorites. Cryptos. This is Langley, Virginia, CIA headquarters.
66.21s - 72.21s |  And that white building with the funny shaped roof is the cafeteria. And outside the windows
72.21s - 79.01s |  of the cafeteria, there is a green landscaped area with a sculpture called Cryptos. It was
80.61s - 89.57s |  commissioned in 1988, installed in 1990. And it has an encrypted inscription on it. And there are
89.57s - 99.73s |  four parts. So the sculptor was or is Jim Sanborn. And the designer of the ciphers on it is Ed Scheidt.
100.45s - 109.89s |  I've met both of them. Jim Sanborn, no public list of his works really existed until I started
109.89s - 115.65s |  making one around 2003. And then he kind of called me up and he said, who are you and why do you have
115.65s - 123.65s |  a web page about me? And I explained that I was a big fan. And now we're getting along much better.
123.65s - 132.21s |  And Ed Scheidt, also he's listed as the retired chairman of a CIA cryptographic center. There is
132.21s - 140.13s |  no CIA cryptographic center, but he's a spook. Okay. He's been involved with the CIA for a long
140.13s - 146.93s |  time. So the inscription, I won't go into great detail about how these are made. We kind of number
146.93s - 155.73s |  them K1 through K4. And we've solved the first three parts. The fourth part has not been solved
155.73s - 161.65s |  yet. So it is one of the most famous unsolved codes in the world. And Sanborn has actually
161.65s - 171.33s |  given us some clues about it. He gave us the clue that in 2010, that starting at the 64th character
171.33s - 178.85s |  there is the word Berlin. And after that, we have the word clock. So there's been a lot of research
178.85s - 185.65s |  done on clocks in Berlin. And then in January, 2020, he gave us another clue, the word Northeast.
185.65s - 191.49s |  And then the pandemic started and he kind of wanted to stir things up. And so he gave another
191.49s - 198.37s |  clue, which is the word East. So it's kind of embarrassing now because we have a big chunk
198.37s - 204.21s |  of what is supposedly the deciphered text and we still don't know what it says. So
205.49s - 211.41s |  the cryptos I should also mention is a big part of a book by Dan Brown, who wrote the book,
211.41s - 219.17s |  The Da Vinci Code in 2003, which, and this sequel, The Lost Symbol, takes place in Washington,
219.17s - 227.65s |  DC, published in 2009. And it does feature both cryptos and Freemasons as recurring themes.
227.73s - 236.21s |  And in the book, there is a character named Nola K, which he put in there he named after me. So
236.21s - 240.93s |  it's sort of a scrambled version of my name there because I helped him with some of the research
240.93s - 248.21s |  for the book. So why hasn't K4 been solved yet? Well, it's short. It's just 97 characters.
248.77s - 256.53s |  So it's very difficult. There may be a key that is only accessible on CIA grounds.
256.53s - 263.33s |  We might have missed something. We might have been misdirected and he may have messed it up.
263.89s - 270.93s |  There might be a mistake that makes it unsolvable. So we have it on our list here as
271.49s - 280.37s |  an unsolved crypto mystery. Okay, let's now come to the next crypto mystery, the so-called
281.25s - 290.53s |  Bosnian Cryptograms. Well, this story takes us to the year 1882, and it takes place in New York
290.53s - 297.73s |  State. Well, honestly, there are not many pictures about this story. So I created a couple of
297.73s - 307.41s |  pictures myself. I used Lego for it. So the story takes place in Essex County, New York, and in the
307.41s - 317.41s |  year 1882, a stranger came to this place. His name was Henry de Bosnius. And after only a few
317.41s - 326.93s |  weeks, he started courting a widow who lived in this area. Her name was Elizabeth Wells. And
326.93s - 334.61s |  after only a few weeks later, the two married. So all this went pretty fast. And it was already
334.61s - 342.13s |  Henry de Bosnius' third marriage. His first two wives had died pretty early after the wedding.
343.49s - 349.09s |  Now he had found a third wife. But again, the marriage didn't last very long, because after
349.09s - 359.73s |  only about five weeks or so, his wife was found dead. She was both stabbed and shot. And well,
359.73s - 366.61s |  it's no wonder that Henry de Bosnius became the prime suspect. And all the events I told you about
366.61s - 373.25s |  took place within a very short timeframe. On May the 1st, Henry de Bosnius came to Essex County.
373.25s - 381.57s |  Only five weeks later, he married. And seven weeks later, his wife was murdered. And as I said,
381.57s - 389.25s |  Henry de Bosnius became the prime suspect. He was arrested, put into jail. And while he was in jail,
390.29s - 397.41s |  he wrote a couple of poems, a couple of other texts. He drew a few pictures. Apparently,
397.41s - 403.17s |  he was quite good at things like that. He knew a lot about literature. He spoke several languages.
403.17s - 411.33s |  And he also was a good artist. And in addition, he created a couple of encrypted messages.
412.29s - 421.57s |  I will come back to this later. Well, then he was put on trial. The trial started on January 20th,
421.57s - 431.25s |  1883. It ended with a verdict. He was condemned to death on April 16th. And well, there's an
431.25s - 439.33s |  interesting story about this. Before he died, or before he went to execution, he sold his body to
439.33s - 446.61s |  a local physician who could use it for scientific experiments. And with the money he gained,
446.61s - 455.73s |  he bought himself a suit so he could die in a nice suit. And apparently, that was important to him.
457.01s - 464.37s |  Well, he was hanged. And as you can see here, he was hanged in his nice suit he had purchased
464.37s - 472.37s |  with the money he had made. And that was on April 27th, 1883. And somehow, well, as I said,
472.37s - 479.01s |  he sold his body to a physician and somehow his skull finally made it to a local museum,
479.01s - 485.73s |  the Adirondack History Center Museum. And there it can be seen along with the hangman's rope that was
485.73s - 493.17s |  used. Well, this is certainly an interesting case with a couple of open questions. For example,
493.81s - 499.81s |  the first question, of course, is, was Henry de Bosnitz really guilty? Well, he probably was.
499.81s - 506.69s |  He always denied being the murderer of his wife. But apparently, there was enough evidence to
507.57s - 514.69s |  find him guilty. Well, as I said, his first two wives died pretty early too. So the question is,
514.69s - 523.09s |  of course, did he murder them too? We don't know. And who was he anyway? Because while on trial,
523.09s - 528.21s |  he said, well, I'm not really Henry de Bosnitz. This is only a pseudonym. I'm somebody else.
528.93s - 535.49s |  This is not my true identity. This might have been a lie. But it was not really clear who he really
535.49s - 541.97s |  was. And his background was not really clear. So there are a couple of questions. And maybe
541.97s - 548.45s |  these questions could be answered if it was possible to decipher the encrypted messages
548.45s - 556.13s |  he created in jail. Well, altogether, he created four messages, four cryptograms. As you see here,
556.85s - 564.53s |  he also added a couple of drawings. And as you can also see, these messages contain a lot of
564.53s - 573.73s |  different letters. So the alphabet he used was pretty large. And we have no clue what is written
573.73s - 580.21s |  in these notes. De Bosnitz, he spoke several languages, English, French, Portuguese, Latin,
580.21s - 587.49s |  Greek. So it's not even clear which plain text language he used. Of course, when one tries to
587.49s - 594.21s |  solve an encrypted message of this kind, it's always a good idea to look for crypts. And in
594.21s - 600.85s |  this case, there is a potential crypt. Because what you see here is a poem de Bosnitz wrote while
600.85s - 606.29s |  in jail. And this looks pretty similar as one of his encrypted messages. So maybe there's a
606.29s - 613.25s |  one-to-one relationship. If this really is the case, it would go a long way in solving
613.25s - 622.61s |  the mystery. But so far, nobody has really managed to match the two texts and to make sense
622.61s - 630.37s |  of it. So maybe it is not a crypt. Or maybe the correct way to use this crypt hasn't been found yet.
631.25s - 638.93s |  So the message is still undeciphered. And so we are dealing with an unsolved,
638.93s - 643.73s |  more or less unsolved criminal case. And it's also an unsolved crypto mystery.
650.06s - 657.58s |  So next, we're going to go to something I find super interesting. This is from World War II.
657.58s - 667.02s |  A pigeon, a carrier pigeon, was found in the chimney of someone in Surrey in England. He
667.02s - 676.38s |  found it in 1982, brought it to public attention in 2012. So we think that the pigeon was on its
676.38s - 686.62s |  way to RAF Bomber Command in High Wycombe there. And the pigeon carried an encrypted message.
686.62s - 695.90s |  So carrier pigeons, very briefly in World War II, were used extensively. There were over 250,000
695.90s - 703.34s |  that were being used. And there was even a special medal that was created for particularly brave
703.34s - 709.82s |  pigeons, such as ones that took an injury and still managed to get to their destination.
710.38s - 717.26s |  This was a medal that was also given to other animals, dogs, horses, and even some cats received
717.26s - 725.74s |  it. So here's the message. It was in, that's actually the leg of the pigeon, and a red
725.74s - 733.50s |  canister there. Red canisters tended to be used either by the United States forces or by the
733.50s - 741.74s |  British Army. And there's the code 2, which we know was RAF Bomber Command in High Wycombe.
741.74s - 748.46s |  And these are the identifiers of the two pigeons. This was a message that was sent in duplicate.
749.66s - 759.02s |  The NURP there, N-U-R-P, meant National Union of Racing Pigeons. And then the 40 and 37 were the
759.02s - 767.58s |  years that these particular pigeons were banded. Then these were probably the homes of the pigeons
767.58s - 775.90s |  where they were hatched and raised, and then their number in that particular year. So the T-W
775.90s - 783.98s |  probably means either Twickenham or Tunbridge Wells, and the D-K probably means Dorking.
784.86s - 791.42s |  Also we have, so of the numbers there, there's the number 6, which would have been the day of the
791.42s - 801.42s |  month, which would tie in with D-Day, June 6, 1944. The time that the form was filled in, the time
801.42s - 809.58s |  that the message was created, and the number of copies sent. So this section was in different
810.14s - 816.86s |  handwriting, was probably filled in by someone else, probably someone in France, as opposed to
817.74s - 822.62s |  someone who was English, and that would tie in with that word L-I-B, which would mean
822.62s - 832.38s |  Libéré, the pigeon was freed at that particular time at 425. And it was sent by a Sergeant Stott.
832.38s - 839.26s |  And research shows that there was a Sergeant William Stott, he was 27 years old, a paratrooper,
839.26s - 846.62s |  and did parachute into occupied Normandy on a reconnaissance mission on D-Day. So this was
846.62s - 856.14s |  probably him sending a message back to home after that. Now of this message, there are 27 groups
856.14s - 864.46s |  of letters, five letters each, and we also know that this A-O-A-K-N appears twice, both at the
864.46s - 872.30s |  beginning and at the end. So what kind of system might have been used? Well, there's several. It
872.30s - 878.54s |  might have been a manual cipher, might have been a codebook, or an encryption machine, or a one-time
878.54s - 884.38s |  pad. There's several kinds of machines that were used in World War II around the time.
885.02s - 890.30s |  So we don't know. And so it is one of the unsolved mysteries.
893.79s - 900.99s |  Yes, and let's now look at another unsolved crypto mystery. This one takes us to my home
900.99s - 908.83s |  country, to Germany. To be more precise, it takes us to Thuringia, which is today one of the 16
908.83s - 916.67s |  states of Germany. And a couple of years ago, a blog reader of mine contacted me and he said,
916.75s - 925.15s |  well, my family is from Thuringia, and for generations we have possessed a cigarette case.
925.95s - 933.55s |  And this cigarette case, well, first of all, it bears this two-letter engravement here. These
933.55s - 940.03s |  letters stand for AES, but this is not the important part. In addition, it contains a
940.03s - 948.67s |  dedication, which was probably engraved here, probably not by a professional, but maybe by the
948.67s - 956.11s |  person who used this cigarette case as a gift, as a present for somebody. And apparently this
956.11s - 965.63s |  dedication is encrypted. You can see it here. We have four lines of unknown symbols. We have no
965.63s - 973.23s |  idea how this can be read, how this can be deciphered. At least it's clear that the date
973.23s - 981.39s |  mentioned here is Christmas Eve, the 24th of December in 1909. And in Germany, in my home
981.39s - 990.75s |  country, Christmas presents are usually given on Christmas Eve. So my suspicion is that this
990.75s - 998.11s |  cigarette case was a Christmas present for somebody. And of course, as I already mentioned,
998.67s - 1003.79s |  when trying to break such an encryption, it's always good to look for grips. And if this really
1003.79s - 1009.87s |  was a Christmas present, it seems possible that something like Merry Christmas, or in German,
1009.87s - 1018.35s |  Frohe Weihnachten, is included. But this grip, if it is one, hasn't helped so far. I can't find
1018.35s - 1026.75s |  anything here that looks like Frohe Weihnachten. So in my view, the whole cryptogram is pretty
1026.75s - 1034.83s |  strange. Well, first of all, it's not strange at all, because there are many encryptions that look
1034.83s - 1042.27s |  like this. Here you have a few on the right side, you have a few encrypted texts from the same time.
1042.27s - 1048.43s |  And I think the similarity is obvious. These encrypted texts from the right side are from
1048.43s - 1054.67s |  encrypted postcards. And it would be no problem to add 100 more here. This is the kind of encryption
1054.67s - 1061.39s |  that was used by people who wrote encrypted postcards or maybe encrypted letters 100 years ago.
1061.39s - 1068.27s |  And almost all of these encryptions can be broken very easily today. So this dedication is
1068.27s - 1074.91s |  an absolute exception, because it looks like all the encryptions from this time,
1074.91s - 1080.91s |  but contrary to almost all others, we have no idea how it can be deciphered.
1082.19s - 1086.43s |  So it's something that looks easy, but appears to be very difficult.
1087.79s - 1093.87s |  If you have an idea on how this can be broken, let us know. But so far, this is an unsolved
1093.87s - 1104.46s |  crypto mystery. So here's one when we talk about famous and not so famous. This is one of the
1104.46s - 1114.70s |  famous ones, the Dorabella cryptogram from Worcester. And it was created by the composer
1114.70s - 1125.50s |  Edward Elgar, who is most famous for a piece called Pomp and Circumstance that you've probably heard
1125.50s - 1134.14s |  at graduation ceremonies. He had an interest in puzzles and even wrote something called the Enigma
1134.14s - 1141.26s |  Variations with 14 different sections, each one that was dedicated to a different person.
1145.49s - 1157.17s |  And one of them was a young woman named Dora Penny, who frequently accompanied his family
1157.17s - 1165.41s |  as they traveled around. She was one of his companions. And she later wrote an autobiography
1165.41s - 1174.45s |  called Memories of a Variation. And at one point when his family was staying with her family,
1174.45s - 1182.29s |  and his mother sent a thank you note, and he included a small note of his own to Dora,
1182.93s - 1193.97s |  and it was in code. This was in 1897. And she was not able to decrypt it and later printed it
1193.97s - 1200.53s |  in her autobiography, right? And said, if anyone can solve it, I would most appreciate it if you
1200.53s - 1209.09s |  could tell me what it says. But no one was able to. And here it is well over 100 years later,
1209.09s - 1214.45s |  we still don't know what it says. It looks like a simple substitution cipher.
1215.09s - 1222.77s |  Now, Elgar did write other encrypted messages. We have access to his notes. And, you know,
1222.77s - 1231.17s |  some of them are alphabetical and very similar symbols, but applying them to the Dorabella
1231.17s - 1237.97s |  Cryptogram does not really give us anything. So, if we take that alphabet and apply it,
1237.97s - 1246.85s |  we get something that is not intelligible. And if we try doing other methods of frequency analysis,
1247.57s - 1254.61s |  that is not intelligible either. We've done frequency analysis and said, well, you know,
1254.61s - 1262.13s |  maybe this one is, you know, the highest frequency one is the letter E and haven't come up with
1262.13s - 1269.01s |  anything there either. We've done other methods. We could, you know, just guessing words, which is
1269.01s - 1275.49s |  difficult because it doesn't really have spaces between the words. And we've tried a technique
1275.49s - 1282.13s |  called hill climbing, but has not come up with anything. The best it has is like now droop
1282.13s - 1293.41s |  beige weeds, so that doesn't seem helpful. And so, why do these methods fail? Well, maybe it's not a
1293.41s - 1300.69s |  substitution cipher. Maybe it's some other method entirely, Morse code or something. Maybe these
1300.69s - 1309.09s |  things are meant to indicate musical notes or something musical. Maybe he made a mistake.
1309.09s - 1315.09s |  Maybe he wrote it when he wasn't feeling well or inebriated or something. And so, maybe there's a
1315.09s - 1321.81s |  mistake. And maybe it was never intended to mean anything, which is unlikely. I mean, she was a
1321.81s - 1329.81s |  friend and, you know, there's no reason that he would have sent her a fraudulent message.
1331.09s - 1337.97s |  And maybe the plain text can't be solved because it doesn't have the patterns of English. For example,
1338.53s - 1344.77s |  there's a sentence, do you go to London tomorrow, which would be very difficult to solve. It doesn't
1344.77s - 1353.65s |  have any ease in it. It doesn't match the normal frequencies. So, this remains an unsolved message.
1356.75s - 1364.83s |  Let's now come to the next one. This is again one of the not so famous cipher mysteries. You
1364.83s - 1372.35s |  won't find this one in the collection you find on YouTube or in the books that have been published.
1372.91s - 1377.07s |  So, this is something not very famous, but very interesting.
1378.35s - 1384.75s |  Well, first of all, let's talk about encrypted postcards. About 100 years ago in the early
1384.75s - 1391.87s |  19th, 20th century, encrypted postcards were very popular. There are literally hundreds of them. I
1391.95s - 1397.47s |  know several people who collect encrypted postcards, and I've seen large collections. I've
1397.47s - 1404.35s |  seen series of encrypted postcards. The longest ones are something like 200 postcards written
1404.35s - 1411.31s |  back and forth between, usually between lovers. I think 90% of the encrypted postcards I've seen
1411.31s - 1419.95s |  are from men to their lovers. So, apparently, they contained love messages. So, apparently,
1419.95s - 1427.55s |  love messages were encrypted quite often 100 years ago. Here you see two examples. It would
1427.55s - 1436.19s |  be no problem to show many more. Here are two more encrypted postcards. Most of these encrypted
1436.19s - 1443.71s |  postcards are not very difficult to solve. Well, this one is especially easy. If you read it
1443.71s - 1450.03s |  backwards, you get, you darling. Of course, most others are not that easy, but still, for an
1450.03s - 1454.75s |  experienced code breakers, it's not really a challenge, usually. For example, this one,
1455.55s - 1465.23s |  this encrypted message consists of numbers from 1 to 25, I think. So, probably every number stands
1465.23s - 1472.03s |  for a letter. And in fact, with some frequency analysis and some word guessing, it's not very
1472.03s - 1478.75s |  difficult to find the substitution table. And there's one complication. This message is written
1478.75s - 1485.63s |  from right to left, but that's easy to get because, as you see, it's a straight line on the
1485.63s - 1492.91s |  right side. So, if you look at it, it's a good guess to assume that it's written from right to
1492.91s - 1499.47s |  left. And again, it's a love message. Baby, I wanted to talk to you so bad. I'm so sorry you
1499.47s - 1505.07s |  did not have time and so on. This is very typical. Most of the encrypted postcards we have looked at
1505.71s - 1513.55s |  have a message of this kind. So, as I said, most of the postcards, almost all of them are solved.
1514.11s - 1521.31s |  But there's this one exception, which is almost driving me mad because I really have absolutely
1521.31s - 1528.19s |  no idea what to do with this postcard. Well, first of all, it's the oldest one I know. It's from
1528.19s - 1535.63s |  1873. All other encrypted postcards I've seen so far were written at a later point of time.
1536.75s - 1541.95s |  And, well, this is the front side. As you can see here, it was written to a certain
1541.95s - 1550.75s |  Lizzie Furlong. She lived actually near Luton. And this is the rear side. Here's the message
1550.75s - 1559.39s |  written to this Lizzie. It was written from Luton, and the sender was a certain George Furlong.
1559.39s - 1566.43s |  And in fact, it was the great-great-grandson of George Furlong, who today lives in Canada,
1566.43s - 1571.95s |  who informed me about this postcard. It's in family position for generation, and he has
1571.95s - 1577.87s |  absolutely no clue what this message means. He sent it to me, and he was hoping I could decipher
1577.87s - 1583.31s |  it or my blog readers could decipher it. But in fact, nobody was successful.
1584.99s - 1591.31s |  Well, if you look at this text here, it looks different from almost all other encrypted
1591.31s - 1598.59s |  postcards. Well, first of all, apparently, the writer was fluent. So my guess would be that
1598.59s - 1605.31s |  it's by far not the first time that this person wrote in this script. And this is unusual. Most
1605.31s - 1613.15s |  other postcards look not like the writer was so fluent. And then, some of the letters are not
1614.99s - 1620.51s |  all of the letters are in one line, which is also unusual. I don't know if these additional letters
1621.23s - 1629.07s |  are meant as a correction, or if from the beginning, it was supposed to look this way.
1629.07s - 1640.77s |  I have no idea. Usually, frequency analysis is a good tool to start analyzing such an encrypted
1640.77s - 1646.05s |  message. But in this case, frequency analysis is really different because it's sometimes
1646.05s - 1653.01s |  different to distinguish between the symbols. So this doesn't help very much. Of course,
1653.01s - 1658.93s |  looking for crypts is always a good idea. And well, my guess would be that this is a month,
1658.93s - 1668.61s |  but I don't know which one. And I don't know how to make sense of it. This is probably the name of
1668.61s - 1675.97s |  the recipient, which would be Lizzie. But can you make Lizzie out of these letters? I can't.
1675.97s - 1682.13s |  And finally, here's an underlined word at the top. It's probably not a place because the place
1682.69s - 1690.21s |  is mentioned in the clear. Basically, I have no idea what it is. So if you would know what
1690.21s - 1698.61s |  would be written at the top of such a message, please let me know. Okay, so I have looked at
1698.61s - 1705.65s |  many hypotheses of what all this could be about. And so far, the best one, in my view, I found is
1706.21s - 1712.13s |  that it's a phonetic script. Well, as we all know, in the English language, it happens quite often
1712.13s - 1717.89s |  that letter combinations or that the same letter combination is pronounced in a different way,
1717.89s - 1726.93s |  or sometimes several letters stand for one sound, or sometimes some letters are not pronounced at
1726.93s - 1733.17s |  all. And for this reason, in the 19th century, there were linguists who tried to create phonetic
1733.17s - 1744.61s |  scripts. A phonetic script is a script where every letter corresponds to one sound of the
1744.61s - 1751.65s |  language. And here on the right, you see a few examples, the short alphabet, this alphabet,
1751.65s - 1758.45s |  and the quick script alphabet. I think there's a certain similarity. And I wouldn't be surprised
1758.45s - 1763.81s |  if this message had been written in a phonetic script too. But so far, I didn't find a phonetic
1763.81s - 1772.61s |  script that looks like this. So it seems like a good theory, but so far it has proven to be a dead
1772.61s - 1783.09s |  end. Well, finally, this is the cover of our book. And as you can see here, the Furlong postcard is
1783.09s - 1788.93s |  one of our favorite unsolved crypto mysteries. And this is why we even mention it or we even
1788.93s - 1795.57s |  used it on the cover of our book. So the lines you see here are from the Furlong postcard.
1795.57s - 1800.53s |  So maybe someday somebody will see the cover of the book and we will immediately recognize,
1800.53s - 1806.69s |  well, this is the so-and-so script. And he would tell us how all this works. But so far,
1806.69s - 1812.53s |  this hasn't happened. Again, we are dealing with an unsolved crypto mystery.
1816.58s - 1825.63s |  Thank you. So now we're going to talk about something that surely is solvable,
1825.63s - 1835.63s |  which is called Encrypt. And it's from south of the equator in Canberra, where a science museum
1835.63s - 1843.23s |  has a science educator who created this sculpture. You might call it the Southern Cryptos,
1843.87s - 1852.03s |  but he called it Encrypt. All right. And for the anniversary, one of the Canberra
1852.03s - 1861.47s |  founding anniversaries in 2013, he created the sculpture. All right. And this is Glenn McIntosh,
1861.47s - 1869.47s |  who's probably one of the number one fans of Encrypt and has a website with lots of information
1869.47s - 1879.95s |  about it. So Encrypt comprises eight pillars. And on these pillars, there are cryptograms
1879.95s - 1887.95s |  of different types. We know that there are at least 16 there, about six of which are solved.
1888.91s - 1896.99s |  Here is an example of one on pillar C. The rings there that you see on the pillar can be turned.
1897.55s - 1905.87s |  So it's clearly indicating something relating to Enigma and the rotors on the Enigma machine.
1905.87s - 1913.31s |  And so you can map out how the different letters are connected to each other. And this is one that
1913.39s - 1922.75s |  is solved, that is on pillar B. And it uses... So with this narrower portion of pillar B,
1922.75s - 1930.27s |  it's as though you could wrap something around it with a very specific diameter. And this is
1930.27s - 1939.95s |  indicating an old system called a scatale, where you would wrap a piece of leather or papyrus
1939.95s - 1947.87s |  around some sort of a wooden stick and write the message, and then unwrap it and send it.
1947.87s - 1956.43s |  And the receiver would have to have a stick of the exact same diameter in order to be able to
1956.43s - 1966.82s |  read the message. And this is the message from pillar B. All right. And here's pillar H, one of
1966.82s - 1975.06s |  the ones that is still unsolved. And if you look at the different letters that are on this metallic
1975.06s - 1983.86s |  pillar, you'll see that certain of the letters, specifically P, L, and V, are a little bit larger
1983.86s - 1992.18s |  than the other letters. We don't know why. We've talked to the artist, and he has told us that
1992.74s - 2001.06s |  all of the different puzzles together are connected, and some need to be solved before
2001.06s - 2007.70s |  others, and that this particular one is one that will have to wait till towards the end
2007.70s - 2015.78s |  before it can be solved. All right. And altogether, there are several unsolved crypto mysteries.
2016.74s - 2024.74s |  Okay. So, this is the last chapter now. We are going to look at a few more crypto mysteries
2024.74s - 2031.78s |  in brief now. For example, this is a mystery we found on a Russian website.
2033.14s - 2039.14s |  This takes us to Kaliningrad, which is today a city in Russia. It used to be German until the
2039.14s - 2045.78s |  end of the Second World War. The name was Königsberg. And near Kaliningrad, there's a
2045.78s - 2053.06s |  place or a town named Baltisk. And according to this Russian website we found a couple of years
2053.06s - 2061.46s |  ago, something was found in Baltisk. It was a bottle post. Well, as you can see here, this place
2061.46s - 2066.98s |  is not on the seashore, or it is not near water, so it's certainly unusual to find a bottle post
2066.98s - 2074.42s |  there. But it happened next to this house. In 2015, a bottle post was found here.
2075.78s - 2083.38s |  And we don't have a picture of the bottle, but we have a picture of the message. It's the front
2083.38s - 2092.82s |  side and the rear side. And we don't know what this message says. And it's also completely unclear
2092.82s - 2100.26s |  what the purpose or the background of this message is. Our estimation is that it's from
2100.26s - 2107.78s |  the 1950s, more or less, or maybe a little later, maybe a little earlier. And of course, it could
2107.78s - 2114.42s |  be a Cold War dead drop. Maybe it was a message written by a spy or for a spy with an encryption
2114.42s - 2122.58s |  system used by secret services. And maybe somebody put this bottle with this message somewhere
2123.14s - 2128.34s |  there for a spy to pick it up. Would be a possibility. Of course, it would be a spectacular
2128.34s - 2135.14s |  possibility. Maybe it could also be a toy created by a couple of children or something like that.
2135.14s - 2141.54s |  You never know. Of course, it would be interesting to know what the message says. But so far,
2141.54s - 2147.06s |  it's an unsolved crypto mystery. Here's a completely different one, but also very interesting.
2148.02s - 2153.86s |  The man here is Ignatius Polacki, a private detective from London in the 19th century.
2154.74s - 2161.94s |  He was one of the first private detectives known in history. And some people call him the real
2161.94s - 2167.78s |  Sherlock Holmes. It's pretty clear that when Arthur Conan Doyle wrote his Sherlock Holmes
2167.78s - 2173.78s |  stories a few decades later, he clearly had Polacki and maybe a few other real detectives
2173.78s - 2181.22s |  in his mind. So Polacki certainly influenced the criminal literature of the times.
2182.02s - 2190.26s |  And contrary to Sherlock Holmes, Ignatius Polacki published encrypted newspaper advertisements
2190.26s - 2196.82s |  in The Times. We actually don't know how many he published, but we know about five or six
2196.82s - 2203.86s |  that contain his name. There might be many more, because usually if you publish a secret message
2203.86s - 2208.58s |  or an encrypted message, you don't mention your name. But in some cases, he apparently did.
2209.62s - 2215.06s |  This one is more a code message. Turkeys are in gangs, eagles fly alone.
2215.06s - 2220.58s |  We have no idea what this sentence means, and it will be pretty difficult to find out.
2220.58s - 2227.14s |  Here we have a few more, and these are not code messages, but really encrypted messages,
2227.14s - 2233.62s |  cipher messages. You see in all of these messages, the name Polacki is mentioned,
2233.62s - 2241.14s |  sometimes including the address. And honestly, we have no clue how these messages can be
2241.14s - 2248.58s |  deciphered. So Polacki might have used a codebook. So it could be possible to decipher the messages
2248.58s - 2254.66s |  if we find the codebook he used. But it looks difficult, because even if he used a codebook,
2254.66s - 2261.54s |  he might have used super encryptions or an additional encryption. Very difficult. So these
2261.54s - 2267.78s |  are clearly unsolved crypto mysteries, but a very hard one. Or if you look at the lower one,
2267.78s - 2274.58s |  he uses symbols. I've never seen symbols like these before. And in my view, they are pretty
2274.58s - 2280.50s |  complicated to encrypt something. You don't need symbols of this kind, especially if you want
2280.50s - 2285.78s |  to print this in a newspaper. So I have absolutely no idea why he used these symbols and
2287.30s - 2293.46s |  what they mean. And all of them are different. So frequency analysis doesn't help very much.
2293.46s - 2299.54s |  Almost all are different. There's one repetition. So frequency analysis doesn't help.
2299.54s - 2309.54s |  We have no idea what all this is about. And finally, a list of unsolved crypto mysteries
2309.54s - 2316.10s |  would be incomplete without the famous Voynich manuscript. The Voynich manuscript is a
2316.10s - 2323.38s |  handwritten book from the 15th century, probably. It was handmade, so it was handwritten. The drawings
2323.38s - 2336.18s |  were made by hand. It has 230 pages and over 200 illustrations. And the remarkable thing about
2336.18s - 2341.94s |  the Voynich manuscript is that it's written in a script nobody knows and nobody can read.
2342.50s - 2349.46s |  So we have 230 pages filled with this writing. And of course, there have been dozens of
2349.46s - 2359.38s |  analyses of all kinds, but this has led nowhere so far. So this is a really fascinating and really
2359.38s - 2366.90s |  hard crypto mystery. And of course, the question is, is it solvable at all? It could also be a
2366.90s - 2374.66s |  hoax. It could be an encrypted text. It's also possible that an ordinary writing system was used,
2374.66s - 2382.10s |  but that this writing system is lost now. Basically, we have no idea. I think every year,
2382.10s - 2390.26s |  two or three new solutions are published. But so far, I think 70 solutions also can be found on
2390.26s - 2397.94s |  the internet. But in my view, everything is crap so far. And I'm not the only one who thinks this
2397.94s - 2405.46s |  way. Okay, so it's another unsolved crypto mystery and certainly a very famous one.
2407.66s - 2416.22s |  So in conclusion, there are lots of unsolved messages out there. If you would like to help
2416.22s - 2425.42s |  with any of these, a site that we recommend is Mystery Twister. And they have hundreds of
2425.42s - 2433.82s |  different challenges. Some are solved, some are not solved. And you can go in there and you can
2433.82s - 2440.54s |  sort them by what you want. If you want something easy to cut your teeth on, go to a level one
2441.18s - 2448.30s |  cipher. And if you want one of the unsolved messages or one of the very difficult ones,
2448.30s - 2463.06s |  go for a level X. And thank you. Thank you. We have 17 more minutes for questions. Are there any?
2464.10s - 2472.66s |  And again, congratulations to everyone on surviving DEF CON thus far. Just a little bit more to go.
2472.66s - 2484.98s |  Okay. Any questions? Yes. Yes. Back there. Well, we did a book signing on Friday. And of course,
2485.78s - 2491.86s |  we are welcome. You're welcome to come here and we will sign any books. No problem. We also have
2491.86s - 2498.74s |  some book plates with our autographs on them if someone doesn't have a book. Okay. Yes.
2499.46s - 2503.22s |  During your research, did you come across any that you were able to solve?
2504.66s - 2505.46s |  Repeat the question.
2506.02s - 2513.06s |  The question was, during our research, if we also solved any crypto mysteries. Well,
2513.06s - 2518.42s |  definitely. Well, honestly, we are more the people who talk about it. We are not the great
2518.42s - 2525.94s |  code breakers. But of course, many of the cryptograms that are found are solved.
2526.74s - 2532.58s |  I had a blog introducing unsolved crypto mysteries twice a week or three times a week.
2532.58s - 2538.90s |  And most of the cryptograms I introduced were solved by my blog readers pretty soon.
2538.90s - 2544.26s |  For example, encrypted postcards, I at least published 100 encrypted postcards on my blogs.
2544.26s - 2551.22s |  And I think 99% were solved, except for this only one. So it's in many cases, it's not even
2551.22s - 2556.10s |  very difficult. In some cases, it's very difficult. So there are very good code breakers around.
2556.10s - 2560.42s |  And in some cases, but that's the exception, no solution is found.
2560.42s - 2567.78s |  Yeah, I mean, I solved probably the biggest one is the Cyrillic Projector. This is also created
2567.78s - 2574.74s |  by Jim Sanborn. And this is a cylinder, which is currently at the University of North Carolina,
2574.74s - 2581.30s |  Charlotte. And it's all the letters are in the Cyrillic language. And I didn't do it alone. It
2581.30s - 2586.58s |  was part of a team. But that's probably the most famous one. Yes.
2603.68s - 2609.76s |  Okay, so if I have understood the question correctly, you ask how to start if you have an
2609.76s - 2617.36s |  encrypted text, you don't know what it is, how to start? Okay, well, usually you start by,
2618.00s - 2621.76s |  well, first of all, you need background information. So if you get an encrypted text,
2621.76s - 2626.16s |  you always look, who might have created it? Which languages did this person speak?
2626.72s - 2632.80s |  When was he created? This is important background information. And then you usually
2632.80s - 2639.04s |  apply statistics. So you do a frequency count of the letters, frequency count of the letter pairs
2639.04s - 2644.88s |  of the letter triplets of the word lengths and things like that. Very often, this tells you
2646.40s - 2652.72s |  where to go or what kind of encryption system might have been used. And word guessing is also
2653.68s - 2661.92s |  sometimes a very helpful tool. So yes, and maybe in a couple of years, there will be AI tools who
2661.92s - 2667.84s |  can do this part of the job. I know people who work on this question, and maybe in a couple of
2667.84s - 2673.76s |  years, you feed such a message to an AI tool, and it will at least tell you, well, this looks like
2674.64s - 2679.76s |  a substitution cipher, or this looks like a transposition cipher, and maybe it will even be
2680.56s - 2684.32s |  capable of breaking the cipher. Yeah, some years in the future and,
2684.32s - 2688.48s |  you know, Captain Picard, computer, please solve the Voynich manuscript, right?
2689.04s - 2695.92s |  Okay, yeah, you can. Well, I don't think that this will be successful, but we will see. Yes?
2706.66s - 2714.42s |  Could be. The question was if the encrypted postcard could be something like a PICPAN
2714.42s - 2720.26s |  cipher. The PICPAN cipher was a very popular cipher for centuries. It's also named the
2720.26s - 2728.58s |  Freemason cipher because the Freemasons used it, but others used it as well. I wouldn't know how
2728.58s - 2734.50s |  to match these letters of this message with the Freemason cipher or with the PICPAN cipher, but
2734.50s - 2744.21s |  maybe that's something we could look at again. Who knows? Yeah. Any other questions?
2746.61s - 2773.90s |  Yes? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. I mean, there's so many different ways to slice
2773.90s - 2780.94s |  and dice it. If you have an idea, by all means, have at it. Yes. Well, one thing might be important
2780.94s - 2788.22s |  to note, the spaces that can be seen here are added by us, so there are no spaces in the original.
2788.22s - 2794.30s |  It's just to make the thing better readable. Yeah. Put it in groups of five up to the end
2794.30s - 2801.18s |  of the line and then start the next line with groups of five. Sure. No. Any other? All the
2801.18s - 2832.08s |  help we can get. Yes. I can't hear. Sorry. You mean that this message here, that it was created
2832.08s - 2840.00s |  with a system that includes a key and without the key, it's not possible? Well, this kind of
2840.00s - 2847.36s |  system was available at the time, at the end of the 19th century, so it's certainly possible.
2847.36s - 2853.44s |  The question is if Edward Elgar used such a system to write a message to a friend
2853.44s - 2861.20s |  who apparently had no clue about cryptography. But it certainly would have been possible to
2861.20s - 2883.20s |  use a system that is not breakable today. Yes? You mean a language? You mean a cipher and a
2883.20s - 2893.60s |  writing system? How do we tell if we're dealing with a language or a cipher? Great question.
2894.56s - 2900.32s |  Well, from a cryptographic point of view, a writing system and a simple substitution cipher
2900.32s - 2909.20s |  are the same. So you can use the same methods to break them. So if simply other letters are used,
2909.20s - 2915.12s |  it can be regarded as an encryption, although it was not really meant to be an encryption. It was
2915.12s - 2922.08s |  simply used, simply another system was used. If the encryption is more complicated,
2922.08s - 2928.32s |  you usually see this when you look at the statistics. For example, in English, the E is
2928.32s - 2937.44s |  the most frequent letter with a frequency of about 12 or 14 percent. And if the distribution looks
2937.44s - 2942.64s |  more even, you know that it's not a simple substitution cipher and not an unknown writing
2942.64s - 2947.76s |  system. It must be something else, either a good or a better encryption system or maybe
2947.76s - 2954.00s |  random data or whatever. Sometimes it's difficult to tell.
2960.48s - 2970.40s |  Any other questions? Okay. All right. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good questions.
