**Introduction to Red Teaming and Attack Vectors**

- **Shishir Gupta** is the speaker and technical manager at **Mandiant/Google**.
- Specializes in security services for **operational technology (OT) and control systems**.
- Has over 12 years of experience in offensive security work for industrial control and **cyber-physical systems**.

**Understanding Operational Technology (OT)**

- **Operational Technology**: Deals with systems and platforms that control and automate industrial-scale physical processes.
- OT covers a wide range of **infrastructure** including power, transport, rail, air traffic control, manufacturing, wastewater, telco, and building management systems.
- Real-world attack simulations involve the entire **ecosystem** from enterprise networks to level-one devices controlling physical processes.

**OT Attack Lifecycle**

- **ICS OT Attack Life Cycle**: Multi-step process involving information gathering, perimeter breach, privilege escalation, internal reconnaissance, network propagation, and precise execution.
- **Defender's Perspective**: Each phase of the attack lifecycle presents opportunities for detection and mitigation.
- Understanding the attack lifecycle helps in identifying security issues and developing preventive or detective controls for known **TTPs**.

**Initial Compromise Phase**

- **Objective**: Gain an initial foothold in the target environment.
- Common methods include **social engineering**, spear phishing, supply chain compromise, and physical or wireless access to OT systems.
- Industrial environments often present a large attack surface due to **geographically dispersed field networks**.

**Internal Reconnaissance Phase**

- **Objective**: Extract specific information about the target system using the foothold gained.
- Critical information targeted includes network diagrams, hostnames, IP addresses, and operator manuals.
- This phase provides maximum opportunity for **detection** if indicators of compromise can be flagged.

**Network Propagation Phase**

- Network propagation often involves moving from the IT network to the OT network due to lack of proper segmentation and shared infrastructure.
- Common issues include insecure segmentation, shared **active directory domains**, and exploitable services in OT DMZs.
- Segmentation flaws can be exploited to propagate from IT to OT networks.

**Mission Execution in OT Phase**

- **Objective**: Leverage access or launch exploits to achieve final objectives.
- Tactics depend on the specific OT system and attacker objectives, including remote command execution, manipulation of configuration data, and spoofing communication.
- High-consequence manipulation often requires prior reverse engineering and **exploit development**.

**Key Takeaways**

- Offensive security testing for OT should be carefully considered with risks, hazards, and pre-approved rules of engagement.
- Real-world OT attacks are multi-step processes involving multiple phases.
- Easier to cause process disruption than manipulation, often through direct abuse of pre-built features.
- Important for defenders to understand the ICS-OT attack lifecycle and to develop controls and mitigation strategies for known TTPs.
