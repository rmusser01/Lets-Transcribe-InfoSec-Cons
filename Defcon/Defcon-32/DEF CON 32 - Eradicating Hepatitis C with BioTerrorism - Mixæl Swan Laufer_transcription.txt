  "title": "DEF CON 32 - Eradicating Hepatitis C with BioTerrorism - Mix\u00e6l Swan Laufer",
  "description": "A quarter million people die from Hepatitis C yearly, and it's getting worse. But for the first time in history there is a cure (not just a treatment) for a virus, and it is for Hepatitis C. Take one 400mg pill of Sofosbuvir every day for twelve weeks, and you will be free of the virus. The catch? Those pills are $1,000 USD apiece because the molecule is the so-called \"Intellectual Property\" of Gilead Pharmaceuticals, and they refuse to share. If you have $84,000 USD, Hep C is not your problem. We have developed a way to make the entire course of treatment for $300 USD. This methodology also applies to other diseases. Like any science, the method of manufacture of drugs can be replicated, and we are going to give you all the necessary tools and show you the process top-to-bottom. Watch it happen live, participate, and learn to do it yourself: Use our digital research assistant to help you navigate the scientific literature, get a chemical synthesis pathway, generate code for the the MicroLab to run, and watch the medicine form in the reaction chamber. Finally, press some tablets. The feds say saving a life this way is BioTerrorism. We say: So Be It.",

0.00s - 4.84s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 All right, and with that, Michael's gonna talk to you about eradicating hepatitis C
4.84s - 5.84s |  with bioterrorism.
5.84s - 19.16s |  So one more round of applause for Michael.
19.16s - 27.23s |  I don't know who needs to hear this, but I'm scared too.
27.23s - 32.91s |  All the time of losing the health that I have.
32.91s - 35.47s |  I know what it feels like.
35.47s - 41.95s |  I know what it feels like to not know what's wrong with your body and to have to go shop
41.95s - 49.31s |  for a stranger who has the authority to maybe or maybe not give you what you need.
49.31s - 53.89s |  I know what it feels like to know what's wrong with your body and to know what you need and
53.89s - 61.15s |  to be told you can't have it because the infrastructure has failed and it's not available.
61.15s - 64.55s |  I know what it feels like to be told that you can't get it because it's not legal in
64.55s - 67.25s |  the place where you are.
67.25s - 74.57s |  I know what it feels like to be told that you can't have it because the doctor doesn't
74.57s - 77.53s |  share your opinion.
77.53s - 84.21s |  And perhaps worst of all, I know what it's like to be told you can have it only to realize
84.21s - 89.79s |  that you can't afford it.
89.79s - 93.50s |  I know this happened to you.
93.50s - 95.74s |  It never should have occurred.
95.74s - 98.74s |  This is wrong.
98.74s - 105.58s |  And I hope to show you all some tools so that it doesn't ever have to happen again.
105.58s - 120.23s |  Sorry, there may or may not be some slides, but what you're about to see is a photograph
120.23s - 128.46s |  of me, hopefully, but I'll keep talking.
128.46s - 132.84s |  The photograph you're about to see, you'll notice I looked different then.
132.84s - 135.10s |  I had long hair.
135.10s - 138.42s |  I was overseas.
138.42s - 144.40s |  Three days later, I had no hair anywhere on my body.
144.40s - 149.46s |  And three weeks later, I had all new skin.
149.46s - 154.94s |  And I decided to be magnanimous and not show you how it came off, but it was rough and
154.94s - 155.94s |  it was ugly.
155.94s - 164.97s |  Then there's another picture.
164.97s - 167.65s |  I'm recovering in a hospital.
167.65s - 171.41s |  I have an IV in my hand.
171.41s - 176.06s |  A tumor had just been removed from my body.
176.06s - 177.06s |  This was the first picture.
177.16s - 179.44s |  You guys see it?
179.44s - 184.32s |  Here I am three days later.
184.32s - 190.68s |  Here I am three weeks later.
190.68s - 192.32s |  Here I am in the hospital.
192.32s - 195.88s |  Well, somewhere, I'm in the hospital.
195.88s - 201.76s |  And they'd removed a tumor from my body that was invisible on the MRI.
201.76s - 209.14s |  And the only reason it got removed is because I insisted on it.
209.14s - 212.90s |  There's another picture of me in the hospital.
212.90s - 213.90s |  I can see my slides.
213.90s - 214.90s |  Sorry, guys.
215.14s - 218.98s |  I don't know if it's still getting black screen, but it's all right.
218.98s - 224.36s |  There's another picture of me recovering in the same hospital because I had to have another
224.36s - 238.34s |  operation also under general anesthesia just to prepare for the other surgery.
238.34s - 251.00s |  Now, the important thing to note and what I'm trying to impart here is that most medications
251.16s - 259.16s |  you can make a better, cheaper version of yourself at home.
259.16s - 262.88s |  Anybody can.
262.88s - 264.48s |  It's entirely doable.
264.48s - 271.05s |  Now, if the slides won't come up for whatever reason, I'll talk through it.
271.05s - 275.43s |  But there are a handful of tools that you need to go through this.
275.43s - 280.07s |  The first thing that you need to do is you need some chemistry.
280.07s - 283.83s |  Now, most people kind of cower.
283.83s - 284.83s |  Chemistry seems hard.
285.63s - 286.63s |  It's like a specialized thing.
286.63s - 292.75s |  Well, sure, if you're doing research chemistry, yeah, that's why there's a PhD in it, of course.
292.75s - 298.23s |  But if you just need to operate it, similar to the difference between building a computer
298.23s - 303.47s |  and using a computer, it's significantly easier.
303.47s - 309.07s |  It says a lot about the state of humanity when we develop all of these things and don't
309.07s - 310.07s |  deliver them.
310.07s - 312.39s |  Sorry, I just got to bounce back to this slide, too.
312.39s - 314.75s |  This is so important.
314.75s - 318.95s |  Those research chemists that are doing biochemistry, they're doing medicine, they're doing incredibly
318.95s - 319.95s |  important things.
319.95s - 320.95s |  It's amazing.
320.95s - 321.95s |  It's amazing.
321.95s - 322.95s |  It's so sophisticated.
322.95s - 326.71s |  And yeah, there's a reason that they get PhDs in it.
326.71s - 335.07s |  But if all you're trying to do is pirate something, that's doable and it can be automated.
335.07s - 337.19s |  I believe this.
337.19s - 339.91s |  That's why I'm here.
339.91s - 343.31s |  Hacking is important for the world.
343.31s - 344.43s |  It saves lives.
344.43s - 345.79s |  All of you know this.
345.79s - 346.99s |  You've seen it.
346.99s - 349.15s |  This is just a little more direct.
349.15s - 350.75s |  It can happen with anything.
350.75s - 355.35s |  You take something and you use it for a purpose for which it was not intended so that you
355.35s - 358.53s |  are no longer gatekept against access.
358.53s - 366.56s |  This is why we do what we do, and I know you all understand this.
366.56s - 368.60s |  Knowledge belongs to all of humanity.
368.60s - 371.80s |  I believe this with every fiber of my being.
371.80s - 377.92s |  There have been moments in history where economics and morality have come to a head, and the
377.92s - 382.04s |  economists have said, you can't have that.
382.04s - 383.04s |  I'm sorry.
383.04s - 384.04s |  It's not moral.
384.04s - 386.76s |  It's the way our economy works.
386.76s - 390.96s |  And the moralists have come back and said, that's not good enough.
390.96s - 393.34s |  It happened in this country with slavery.
393.34s - 395.52s |  People said, people can't be property.
395.52s - 397.12s |  That is not acceptable.
397.12s - 401.68s |  And the economists said, yes, it's really unfortunate and it's kind of old, but that's
401.68s - 402.92s |  how our economy runs.
402.92s - 407.52s |  And the moralists came back and said, that's not good enough.
407.52s - 413.88s |  And similarly today, people are dying every day because of intellectual property law,
413.88s - 418.24s |  making it so that people do not have access to the medicines they need.
418.24s - 421.16s |  And the economists say, oh, I know it's an old system.
421.16s - 422.16s |  I know it's being abused.
422.16s - 425.84s |  It's kind of unfortunate, but there are trillions of dollars circling the world.
425.84s - 429.12s |  We can't just pull the rug out from under that.
429.12s - 442.70s |  And there are some of us who are saying, that's not good enough.
442.70s - 444.90s |  I know you all believe in the right to repair.
444.90s - 446.50s |  I do too.
446.50s - 449.18s |  I believe in the right to repair for your body.
449.18s - 451.82s |  And this is not a new idea.
451.82s - 455.70s |  It used to be that everybody was involved in their own health.
455.70s - 461.50s |  The notion that you can't manage your own health is fairly new.
461.50s - 463.66s |  Gates had been put up saying, you can't do this.
463.66s - 465.88s |  You're practicing medicine without a license.
465.88s - 467.38s |  You're not allowed.
467.38s - 472.71s |  But if you come to the authority, we'll sell it back to you.
472.71s - 474.23s |  That's not acceptable.
474.23s - 476.75s |  You need to become involved in your own health.
476.75s - 478.91s |  You can't just follow doctor's orders.
478.91s - 480.55s |  It's not good enough anymore.
480.55s - 483.31s |  I don't know if it ever was.
483.31s - 487.43s |  We know that this is not an excuse in wartime.
487.43s - 491.27s |  Why is it still an excuse when you're dealing with your health?
491.27s - 492.27s |  It shouldn't be.
492.27s - 496.20s |  I'm going to say this again.
496.20s - 502.84s |  You can make most medicines yourself at home, and you can make them better.
502.84s - 504.40s |  I'm not kidding.
504.40s - 507.16s |  Better and cheaper.
507.16s - 510.64s |  Now, we're going to have to look at how.
510.64s - 513.20s |  I want to do a quick poll here.
513.20s - 519.84s |  How many people know somebody who owns a cat who is also either immunocompromised or pregnant?
519.84s - 520.84s |  Show of hands real quick.
520.84s - 521.84s |  Yeah?
521.84s - 522.84s |  Okay.
522.84s - 523.84s |  A couple.
523.84s - 524.84s |  Next.
524.84s - 528.84s |  How many people know somebody who has an allergy that sends them into anaphylactic shock?
528.84s - 529.84s |  Oh, yeah.
529.84s - 530.84s |  Plenty.
530.84s - 531.84s |  Okay.
532.84s - 536.84s |  How many people know somebody who has hepatitis C?
536.84s - 537.84s |  All right.
537.84s - 538.84s |  A couple.
538.84s - 539.84s |  All right.
539.84s - 540.84s |  I'm going to remember you.
540.84s - 549.20s |  How many people have a uterus and are child-free by choice?
549.20s - 550.20s |  Cool.
550.20s - 551.20s |  All right.
551.20s - 557.02s |  Fewer than I thought, but all right.
557.02s - 559.02s |  Who remembers this guy?
559.02s - 565.02s |  This is Martin Shkreli, and what you're seeing right now is him lying to Congress.
565.02s - 571.02s |  He was CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, and what he was lying about was the pricing structure
571.02s - 576.02s |  of daraprim, pyrimethamine, an anti-toxoplasmosis drug.
576.02s - 583.02s |  It had been $13.50 a pill, and he changed the price to $750 a pill.
583.02s - 592.82s |  If you calculate this out, a full course of treatment is just south of $19,000.
592.82s - 595.82s |  This is his phone number.
595.82s - 598.82s |  I called him from stage at Hope in 2016.
598.82s - 602.82s |  He didn't answer, but he called me back a few hours later.
602.82s - 606.82s |  Of course, he got hauled off to prison a while after that.
606.82s - 608.82s |  Here's what we did.
608.82s - 609.82s |  We took exception to this.
609.82s - 611.82s |  We found a new synthesis pathway.
611.82s - 613.82s |  It had one step fewer.
613.82s - 614.82s |  It was much more efficient.
614.82s - 619.82s |  There were greater margins of error, and there was greater purity in yield.
619.82s - 621.82s |  So we made some.
621.82s - 627.82s |  Here I am at that same conference throwing pills to the audience that cost me a quarter to make each.
627.82s - 631.82s |  And you can make these things too.
631.82s - 633.82s |  Making pills is easy.
633.82s - 637.82s |  If you have active pharmaceutical ingredient, just pack it into caplets.
637.82s - 639.82s |  Measure it out.
639.82s - 640.82s |  Everybody can do this.
640.82s - 642.82s |  It's not difficult.
642.82s - 645.82s |  And here's what a course of treatment looks like.
645.82s - 650.82s |  Now, it's amazing there was so much outrage around what he did,
650.82s - 654.82s |  and yet the pricing structure still has not changed,
654.82s - 658.82s |  but you can make a full course of treatment for $80.
658.82s - 669.72s |  Now, who said they knew somebody who had a cat and was pregnant?
669.72s - 672.35s |  You want it?
672.35s - 674.35s |  I'll toss it out.
674.35s - 676.35s |  Keep that person healthy.
676.35s - 678.35s |  Keep that person safe.
678.35s - 682.69s |  More to come.
682.69s - 684.69s |  This is Heather Bresch.
684.69s - 687.69s |  She is, can you guess, lying to Congress.
687.69s - 691.69s |  She was CEO of Mylan Pharmaceuticals,
691.69s - 695.69s |  and she was lying about the pricing structure of the EpiPen.
695.69s - 698.69s |  I know everybody remembers this one.
698.69s - 701.69s |  It was $60 for a pair.
701.69s - 708.58s |  And then she decided it was going to be $604 for a pair.
708.58s - 714.58s |  We presented about this in 2018, and I called her at this number.
714.58s - 715.58s |  It might still work.
715.58s - 718.58s |  You can try it.
718.58s - 723.39s |  She didn't answer.
723.39s - 725.39s |  We decided to make our own version.
725.39s - 727.39s |  It's not a complicated thing.
727.39s - 730.39s |  You take an auto-injector that's designed for needle-phobic diabetics.
730.39s - 737.39s |  You put in a small syringe, a large needle, and a vial of epinephrine.
737.39s - 739.39s |  You can make one, too.
739.39s - 741.39s |  This costs $30.
741.39s - 744.39s |  Additionally, you can test it to see if it works,
744.39s - 746.39s |  and you can reload it for $3.
746.39s - 751.70s |  You just need a new needle, a new syringe, and a new hit of Epi.
751.70s - 756.70s |  And again, after all of this time, the pricing structure has not shifted.
756.70s - 759.70s |  There is no leverage to change these prices.
759.70s - 761.70s |  You can make your own.
761.70s - 763.70s |  It's not hard.
763.70s - 771.70s |  Now, who said they had a friend who had anaphylactic shock?
771.70s - 773.70s |  You want it?
773.70s - 776.70s |  All right, here, pass it back.
776.70s - 778.70s |  Keep that person healthy.
778.70s - 779.70s |  Keep that person safe.
779.70s - 780.70s |  And make more.
780.70s - 786.61s |  It's not hard.
786.61s - 789.61s |  And then there was this time that these nine robed creeps
789.61s - 791.61s |  decided they were going to ruin...
791.61s - 793.61s |  Sorry, hang on.
793.61s - 796.61s |  And then there was this time that these nine robed creeps
796.61s - 799.61s |  decided they were going to just ruin everything for everyone
799.61s - 802.61s |  by saying you couldn't have the medicine you wanted
802.61s - 805.61s |  if you happened to have a uterus.
805.61s - 808.61s |  We thought this wasn't cool either.
808.61s - 810.61s |  And at Hope in 2022,
810.61s - 815.61s |  we figured out a way to dope business cards with abortion drugs.
815.61s - 819.61s |  It's fairly simple, and you can do it too.
819.61s - 821.61s |  Here's all you need.
821.61s - 823.61s |  You get some active pharmaceutical ingredients,
823.61s - 827.61s |  some Everclear, a blender, and a pipette.
827.61s - 830.61s |  Then all you do is you put in the Everclear,
830.61s - 832.61s |  you put in the powder, you blend it up,
832.61s - 838.61s |  and then you take the pipette and you put six dots on a business card.
838.61s - 842.61s |  Here I am two years ago at DEF CON at a house not far from here
842.61s - 845.61s |  making about 200 on a table.
845.61s - 847.61s |  Here's all you do.
847.61s - 849.61s |  You lay them out.
849.61s - 854.14s |  That top one's special edition. You can't get that anymore.
854.14s - 857.14s |  You put six dollops on a card.
857.14s - 860.14s |  Those are the three doses that you need to induce an abortion.
860.14s - 862.14s |  You let it dry.
862.14s - 865.14s |  It curls up like this, and then you put it in a baggie.
865.14s - 867.14s |  It is super simple.
867.14s - 871.14s |  Here's the entire table, and then you bag them up in the morning.
871.14s - 875.14s |  And then maybe you put them places
875.14s - 877.14s |  because it's just the size of a card,
877.14s - 884.58s |  maybe in the family planning section in a drugstore,
884.58s - 887.58s |  or maybe at your local public library.
887.58s - 890.58s |  You find an appropriate volume
890.58s - 893.58s |  that somebody who might be in need might find,
893.58s - 897.83s |  and you just slip it in there.
897.83s - 901.83s |  And again, the recipe you just saw is for 100 cards,
901.83s - 905.83s |  so maybe you even get really creative
905.83s - 909.83s |  and decide that another third place that people go to
909.83s - 913.83s |  who might have trouble getting access to these sorts of things.
916.83s - 923.95s |  I mean, up to you.
923.95s - 927.95s |  The Good Mocker Institute estimates that it's about $500
927.95s - 930.95s |  if you want an abortion through traditional channels.
930.95s - 934.95s |  If you send away for mifepristone and misoprostol pills,
934.95s - 937.95s |  it will cost you about $160.
937.95s - 941.95s |  These cards, they cost 89 cents to make,
941.95s - 944.95s |  including the printing of the cards and the baggies.
944.95s - 948.95s |  You can afford to make these.
948.95s - 951.95s |  And despite all the outrage around all of it,
951.95s - 956.95s |  this pricing structure and the access hasn't shifted much.
956.95s - 960.95s |  Now, for some of you who recognize patterns,
960.95s - 963.95s |  we'll anticipate the next question, which is,
963.95s - 967.95s |  who would like my business card?
967.95s - 969.95s |  Who wants this?
969.95s - 972.95s |  I'm not going to make assumptions, but I think you don't have a uterus.
972.95s - 975.95s |  Yeah, all right. Here, will you pass that back?
975.95s - 980.97s |  And there may or may not be a bunch of these
980.97s - 983.97s |  stashed in ladies' rooms around.
983.97s - 989.14s |  I don't know who put them there.
989.14s - 992.14s |  This is hepatitis C.
992.14s - 994.14s |  This is what we're talking about today.
994.14s - 998.14s |  This is terrifying, and it's not common knowledge.
998.14s - 1001.14s |  It is more virulent than HIV.
1001.14s - 1005.14s |  It is more widespread than HIV, and it is more lethal than HIV.
1005.14s - 1008.14s |  And it is a very clever virus.
1008.14s - 1011.14s |  If you want to get into the molecular biology of it, it's incredible.
1011.14s - 1014.14s |  It is awe-inspiring.
1014.14s - 1018.93s |  This is Sovaldi,
1018.93s - 1022.93s |  also known as sofosbuvir.
1022.93s - 1025.93s |  This molecule makes magic happen.
1025.93s - 1028.93s |  It actually goes in and interdicts
1028.93s - 1031.93s |  in the replication process
1031.93s - 1037.26s |  when hepatitis C is trying to make more of it.
1037.26s - 1040.26s |  Here is the enzyme
1040.26s - 1044.26s |  that allows hepatitis C to make more by replicating RNA.
1044.26s - 1047.26s |  And here is Sovaldi
1047.26s - 1050.26s |  inside of the binding pocket
1050.26s - 1054.26s |  doing what one of our chemists
1054.26s - 1061.17s |  referred to as fucking shit up.
1061.17s - 1064.17s |  This is not just a drug that's helpful.
1064.17s - 1068.17s |  This drug will actually eradicate the virus from your body.
1068.17s - 1071.17s |  This is the first time this has ever been done.
1071.17s - 1074.17s |  If you have a virus, either your body manages it
1074.17s - 1078.17s |  or you have to continuously take antivirals for the rest of your life,
1078.17s - 1081.17s |  you can actually be hepatitis C-free
1081.17s - 1084.17s |  with this drug.
1084.17s - 1087.17s |  It's not just a treatment.
1087.17s - 1090.17s |  You take one pill a day for 12 weeks,
1090.17s - 1093.17s |  and hepatitis C is gone from your body.
1093.17s - 1096.17s |  What is the catch?
1096.17s - 1099.17s |  These pills cost $1,000 apiece.
1099.17s - 1102.17s |  And for those of you who are good with arithmetic,
1103.17s - 1107.17s |  you will notice that this is $84,000 that it costs.
1107.17s - 1111.17s |  And it will come as no surprise to the Americans in the audience
1111.17s - 1115.17s |  that insurance companies aren't super hot to pay for it.
1115.17s - 1119.99s |  Let's look at how shitty hepatitis is.
1119.99s - 1124.62s |  This is how it's gone the last few years.
1124.62s - 1127.62s |  Two seminal moments I'd like to point out.
1127.62s - 1130.62s |  Here's where Sovaldi was invented.
1130.62s - 1134.62s |  Now, those of you who are familiar with the American medical system
1134.62s - 1137.62s |  and how drugs go will know that it takes a while
1137.62s - 1140.62s |  between invention and approval, and indeed it did.
1140.62s - 1143.62s |  But here's where it was approved.
1143.62s - 1146.62s |  Maybe you noticed something kind of strange about the graph.
1146.62s - 1149.62s |  Let's extend the data just a little bit.
1149.62s - 1152.62s |  And you'll see, taking it up to the current day,
1152.62s - 1156.62s |  it's getting worse, not better.
1156.62s - 1161.35s |  That's worth wondering about.
1161.35s - 1165.35s |  Now, as some of you know, I'm a mathematician.
1165.35s - 1169.35s |  I will not require any of you to do the integral
1169.35s - 1172.35s |  to calculate the area under the curve here
1172.35s - 1176.35s |  as to how many people died since it was invented.
1176.35s - 1181.76s |  It was over 5 million
1181.76s - 1184.76s |  between the invention of Sovaldi and today,
1184.76s - 1187.76s |  all of which could have been avoided
1187.76s - 1190.76s |  if they had merely been given this course of treatment.
1190.76s - 1196.16s |  And I take great exception to that.
1196.16s - 1199.16s |  Right now,
1199.16s - 1204.16s |  almost 1% of the entire world has hepatitis C.
1204.16s - 1207.16s |  It's closer to 3 quarters of a percent.
1207.16s - 1211.16s |  But look around this room and do a quick back of the envelope.
1211.16s - 1215.16s |  There are plenty of people right here who have it.
1215.16s - 1218.16s |  Plenty unknowingly.
1218.16s - 1224.66s |  Again, it is more virulent and more deadly than HIV.
1224.66s - 1229.66s |  1.5 million people will get it this year.
1229.66s - 1233.66s |  Some probably, like, you know, later today if they get lucky.
1233.66s - 1236.66s |  Hopefully it's fun in the process.
1236.66s - 1241.66s |  Over a quarter of a million people will die of hepatitis C this year.
1241.66s - 1243.66s |  A quarter of a million.
1243.66s - 1247.66s |  And somebody dies every 2 minutes.
1247.66s - 1250.66s |  How long have I been up here?
1250.66s - 1253.66s |  When I talked about this 5 years ago, it was every 3 minutes.
1253.66s - 1256.66s |  So again, not only is it getting worse,
1256.66s - 1259.66s |  but it's getting worse faster.
1259.66s - 1263.66s |  Now, usually when I start throwing these sorts of numbers out,
1263.66s - 1266.66s |  people get a little depressed.
1266.66s - 1269.66s |  And they ask, is there no hope?
1269.66s - 1274.94s |  And I would like to quote one of my favorite superheroes.
1274.94s - 1278.54s |  Oh, I will give you hope.
1278.54s - 1283.11s |  And I ask only one thing in return.
1283.11s - 1287.74s |  Now, you might not recognize this man,
1287.74s - 1290.74s |  but his name is Daniel O'Day.
1290.74s - 1293.74s |  Interesting last name to be talking about at a hacker conference.
1293.74s - 1296.74s |  You figure somebody is going to fuck with him, right?
1296.74s - 1300.74s |  He is, as you might guess, lying to Congress.
1300.74s - 1303.74s |  He is CEO of Gilead Pharmaceuticals.
1303.74s - 1307.74s |  And he is lying about the pricing structure of Sovaldi,
1307.74s - 1312.74s |  which, as mentioned previously, is $1,000 a pill
1313.74s - 1317.74s |  and is $84,000 for a full course of treatment.
1317.74s - 1323.74s |  Oh man, I had such like a climactic moment that I was building to.
1323.74s - 1327.74s |  Like I was so excited for the next thing.
1327.74s - 1330.74s |  If I can pull it off, it will be great.
1330.74s - 1332.74s |  If not, it's like an NES, right?
1332.74s - 1334.74s |  Everybody remembers this. It's a perfect trick.
1334.74s - 1336.74s |  It should work every time.
1336.74s - 1339.74s |  So in the event that this doesn't work,
1339.74s - 1342.74s |  I'll go a little further from memory.
1342.74s - 1348.31s |  But we need to get back to the how.
1348.31s - 1350.31s |  I talked a lot about why.
1350.31s - 1353.31s |  But there are tools that we have specifically
1353.31s - 1356.31s |  that will help you through the entire process.
1356.31s - 1359.31s |  At the top is the automation of the chemistry.
1359.31s - 1361.31s |  And we have a tool for that,
1361.31s - 1364.31s |  an actual way that you can automate the chemistry.
1364.31s - 1369.31s |  Below that, there's a system that will build
1369.31s - 1374.31s |  the instruction set that the automation system will run.
1374.31s - 1377.31s |  Before that, you actually need to figure out
1377.31s - 1379.31s |  how the synthesis is done.
1379.31s - 1382.31s |  You need to figure out how to start with some material
1382.31s - 1385.31s |  and then work your way to your end product.
1385.31s - 1387.31s |  And we have a tool for that as well.
1387.31s - 1389.31s |  And of course, somewhere along the line,
1389.31s - 1392.31s |  you have to figure out what you want to take for what's wrong.
1392.31s - 1393.31s |  I don't see one.
1393.31s - 1399.26s |  So the first thing is called the apothecary micro lab.
1399.26s - 1402.26s |  And you're going to have to take it on faith,
1402.26s - 1405.67s |  but I got beautiful pictures of it.
1405.67s - 1409.67s |  There are automated lab reactors that are designed for chemistry.
1409.67s - 1412.67s |  The way they work is fairly simple.
1412.67s - 1415.67s |  There's a reaction chamber on the inside.
1415.67s - 1419.67s |  There's a jacket through which liquid flows
1419.67s - 1423.67s |  that allows the reaction chamber
1423.67s - 1425.67s |  to maintain a particular temperature.
1425.67s - 1429.67s |  There's a little paddle inside that will stir.
1429.67s - 1432.67s |  And then there are these little injection systems on the top.
1432.67s - 1436.67s |  Now, problem is, many.
1436.67s - 1440.67s |  First, they're closed source,
1440.67s - 1442.67s |  and they come with all the attendant problems
1442.67s - 1444.67s |  with closed source systems.
1444.67s - 1447.67s |  Number two, they're ridiculously expensive.
1447.67s - 1451.67s |  If you want the most basic model, it's going to be over $5,000.
1451.67s - 1455.67s |  And even if you have $5,000, you can't buy it unless you're a lab.
1455.67s - 1457.67s |  Now, of course, there are ways around that,
1457.67s - 1460.67s |  but why would you want to pay $5,000
1460.67s - 1464.67s |  for something that just stirs, controls temperature,
1464.67s - 1467.67s |  and injects reagents at a particular time?
1467.67s - 1471.67s |  You think you could probably do that yourself, right?
1471.67s - 1473.67s |  Well, I'm a very, very lucky man.
1473.67s - 1475.67s |  I get to brag about some wonderful things
1475.67s - 1478.67s |  that some brilliant people have managed to build,
1478.67s - 1482.67s |  and I get to brag about it unabashedly because I didn't do it.
1482.67s - 1485.67s |  But the apothecary micro lab is something we've been working on
1485.67s - 1487.67s |  for many years, and we have a new version
1487.67s - 1490.67s |  that I like to call version 6,
1490.67s - 1492.67s |  and it does all of these things.
1492.67s - 1496.67s |  You have a small mason jar inside of a larger mason jar.
1496.67s - 1500.67s |  There's fluid that circulates around that...
1500.67s - 1503.67s |  Oh, that doesn't look good.
1503.67s - 1505.67s |  All right, moving on.
1505.67s - 1507.67s |  There's a fluid that circulates around
1507.67s - 1509.67s |  that regulates the temperature.
1509.67s - 1516.92s |  You've got a stirring paddle that comes in.
1516.92s - 1519.92s |  It's made of Teflon, so it's nonreactive.
1519.92s - 1523.92s |  And you've got these tubes that pump things in.
1523.92s - 1525.92s |  The design is somewhat complex,
1525.92s - 1527.92s |  and one thing that I should mention
1527.92s - 1530.92s |  is that tomorrow at 11 a.m.
1530.92s - 1534.92s |  in the content creators stage,
1534.92s - 1536.92s |  we'll be doing an extended version of this talk.
1536.92s - 1538.92s |  It's in number 2.
1538.92s - 1540.92s |  And we will be going through,
1540.92s - 1543.92s |  and we will be demonstrating the actual tool.
1543.92s - 1545.92s |  We will be going through,
1545.92s - 1547.92s |  you will see it making medicines on stage.
1547.92s - 1550.92s |  All of these online systems about which I'm about to speak,
1550.92s - 1552.92s |  you'll be able to interact with in real time
1552.92s - 1555.92s |  because we were discouraged from having live demos
1555.92s - 1558.92s |  on the main stage because, well, you know.
1558.92s - 1568.19s |  So you'll also be able to request particular drugs.
1568.19s - 1571.19s |  If there's a drug that you'd like to know how to make,
1571.19s - 1574.19s |  we'll try and figure out a way on the fly, live.
1574.19s - 1578.66s |  So please come on by. It'll be fun.
1578.66s - 1582.66s |  So then antecedent to the Microlab itself,
1582.66s - 1585.66s |  we have a system called the RecipePress.
1585.66s - 1588.66s |  This is a graphical user interface
1588.66s - 1593.66s |  that allows you to take a procedure
1593.66s - 1596.66s |  for making a chemical reaction happen,
1596.66s - 1599.66s |  and you get to then input it,
1599.66s - 1603.66s |  and it will generate the code so that the system runs it.
1603.66s - 1607.66s |  And the brains of it come in a nice pretty box.
1607.66s - 1609.66s |  I promise you, it's so gorgeous.
1609.66s - 1611.66s |  You'll love it. Come by tomorrow.
1611.66s - 1613.66s |  Or just go on our GitHub,
1613.66s - 1615.66s |  and you can see wonderful pictures of it
1615.66s - 1617.66s |  because it's extremely well documented.
1617.66s - 1619.66s |  Again, I work with wonderful people.
1619.66s - 1624.66s |  As we say, documentation or it's not a project, right?
1625.66s - 1631.66s |  So you can then generate a file that it will run,
1631.66s - 1635.66s |  and then beyond that, you can edit it.
1635.66s - 1637.66s |  It will talk you through the things
1637.66s - 1641.66s |  that are easy for a human but difficult for a machine to do.
1641.66s - 1645.66s |  There's a touch screen that talks you through it.
1645.66s - 1647.66s |  Then for the machine things,
1647.66s - 1649.66s |  where you just need to wait for a long time
1649.66s - 1651.66s |  and regulate the temperature and keep stirring,
1651.66s - 1654.66s |  or easy for a human to get distracted but great for a machine,
1654.66s - 1657.66s |  it will do those for you.
1657.66s - 1660.66s |  Before that, you need to figure out, again, the retrosynthesis.
1660.66s - 1665.78s |  How do you get from point A to point B?
1665.78s - 1667.78s |  A number of years ago, we developed a system
1667.78s - 1669.78s |  that we called ChemHactica.
1669.78s - 1671.78s |  It's a retrosynthesis module
1671.78s - 1674.78s |  where what you can do is literally hop on Wikipedia,
1674.78s - 1676.78s |  look for your drug of choice,
1676.78s - 1679.78s |  scroll down until you find the SMILES code,
1679.78s - 1682.78s |  and hackers out there, if you don't know about this,
1682.78s - 1684.78s |  the SMILES codes are super dope.
1684.78s - 1687.78s |  Invited by the Blue Obelisk Group,
1687.78s - 1690.78s |  an open-source way that you can represent any chemical
1690.78s - 1693.78s |  or any chemical reaction with an ASCII string.
1693.78s - 1695.78s |  It's super cool.
1695.78s - 1698.78s |  You copy that, you paste it into ChemHactica,
1698.78s - 1700.78s |  and you say, how do I make this?
1700.78s - 1703.78s |  It will find ways to do it.
1703.78s - 1705.78s |  It does this combinatorially
1705.78s - 1709.78s |  by looking through all of the chemical literature historically,
1709.78s - 1713.78s |  and then it will put the pieces together
1713.78s - 1716.78s |  and find reactions that have already been tested
1716.78s - 1718.78s |  and connect the dots for you,
1718.78s - 1720.78s |  and it'll make it as simple as you want.
1720.78s - 1724.73s |  How are you doing?
1724.73s - 1726.73s |  Yeah, just a quick question.
1726.73s - 1728.73s |  Is that the right one? Oh, no, no.
1728.73s - 1730.73s |  No, this is not the right one. I see.
1730.73s - 1732.73s |  That was my concern.
1732.73s - 1734.73s |  I didn't want to go poking around your workstation.
1734.73s - 1736.73s |  Thank you. That's all right.
1736.73s - 1738.73s |  Bear with us a moment.
1739.73s - 1743.58s |  Boop! All right.
1743.58s - 1745.58s |  Let's see. Here we go.
1745.58s - 1751.20s |  Maybe.
1751.20s - 1754.20s |  Just last week, I had a guy interview me
1754.20s - 1756.20s |  whose childhood friend...
1756.20s - 1758.20s |  Wonderful.
1758.20s - 1760.20s |  Thank you.
1760.20s - 1762.20s |  Probably.
1762.20s - 1770.06s |  All right, cool.
1770.06s - 1772.06s |  I'm just going to sort of forward the slides
1772.06s - 1774.06s |  until it catches up with me.
1774.06s - 1776.06s |  I got interviewed with a guy
1776.06s - 1778.06s |  who told me this heartbreaking story
1778.06s - 1780.06s |  about his childhood friend
1780.06s - 1782.06s |  dying of...
1782.06s - 1784.06s |  I believe it was multiple sclerosis
1784.06s - 1786.06s |  at 25
1786.06s - 1790.06s |  because she had a very rare subtype,
1790.06s - 1793.06s |  and the medicine
1793.06s - 1795.06s |  for that particular subtype,
1795.06s - 1797.06s |  because it was so rare,
1797.06s - 1800.06s |  had been given orphan drug status,
1800.06s - 1805.06s |  which gave it this extended patent length
1805.06s - 1808.06s |  and also allowed for the price point
1808.06s - 1811.06s |  to be whatever they wanted,
1811.06s - 1816.06s |  and it was priced at $850 a day.
1816.06s - 1818.06s |  And she died.
1818.06s - 1820.06s |  And he and I sat down,
1820.06s - 1822.06s |  and I shared my screen with him,
1822.06s - 1824.06s |  and we went on Chemhaxica,
1824.06s - 1826.06s |  and in a matter of minutes, he and I,
1826.06s - 1828.06s |  neither of us chemists,
1828.06s - 1831.06s |  figured out a way to manufacture it for $20 a day.
1831.06s - 1833.06s |  It's that powerful of a tool.
1833.06s - 1835.06s |  Now, that's not to say, of course,
1835.06s - 1837.06s |  that there isn't some chemistry still to be done.
1837.06s - 1839.06s |  You do need to figure some things out.
1839.06s - 1842.06s |  But this gets a huge jump on it.
1842.06s - 1846.06s |  You could potentially find a synthesis mechanism
1846.06s - 1849.06s |  just with this and a good chemist
1849.06s - 1853.06s |  rather than having a giant team of them work for months.
1853.06s - 1857.06s |  And additionally, this is how we figured out
1857.06s - 1859.06s |  how to make Sovaldi.
1859.06s - 1861.06s |  Um...
1862.06s - 1864.06s |  I kind of, it's tempting to skip ahead,
1864.06s - 1866.06s |  but I kind of don't want to touch it.
1866.06s - 1870.06s |  So I'll keep talking a little bit
1870.06s - 1873.06s |  and see where we are on the clock here.
1873.06s - 1876.06s |  Um, how fragile is this?
1876.06s - 1878.06s |  Where'd my guy go?
1878.06s - 1880.06s |  All right, I'll just keep pressing the button.
1880.06s - 1887.01s |  So both of these services are live now.
1887.01s - 1889.01s |  The other thing to note about the, uh...
1889.01s - 1891.01s |  Is this safe?
1891.01s - 1893.01s |  Can I skip down?
1893.01s - 1895.01s |  No, no, just hit escape. It's fine.
1895.01s - 1897.01s |  And then, uh...
1897.01s - 1899.01s |  Oh, and then I can just scroll.
1899.01s - 1902.01s |  Thank you for bearing with us through this process.
1902.01s - 1904.01s |  I appreciate you all.
1904.01s - 1906.01s |  Oh, right, I was about to do a thing.
1906.01s - 1908.01s |  Okay, cool.
1908.01s - 1910.01s |  So here we go.
1910.01s - 1912.01s |  Yeah, I guess I kind of gave it away, didn't I?
1912.01s - 1914.01s |  All right, but here we go.
1914.01s - 1916.01s |  All right, here's Daniel O'Day.
1916.01s - 1920.01s |  Ha! Lying to Congress about Sovaldi.
1920.01s - 1923.01s |  And I think I have time
1923.01s - 1926.01s |  to take exception to his pricing structure.
1926.01s - 1928.01s |  And my hacker friends,
1928.01s - 1931.01s |  I have a question for you.
1931.01s - 1933.01s |  Should I call him?
1933.01s - 1938.34s |  All right, now don't everybody call him at once.
1938.34s - 1940.34s |  He'll jam the line.
1940.34s - 1942.34s |  Uh, we'll see, uh...
1942.34s - 1944.34s |  We'll see what he has to say.
1944.34s - 1946.34s |  All right, Danny boy.
1946.34s - 1948.34s |  Pipes are calling.
1948.34s - 1950.34s |  Four Thieves Vinegar is calling.
1950.34s - 1952.34s |  And we're not pleased with what you've done.
1952.34s - 1959.34s |  So here we go, 415-533-3976.
1959.34s - 1961.34s |  Call him afterwards if he doesn't answer, okay?
1961.34s - 1968.14s |  Let's give this a try.
1968.14s - 1974.52s |  Can you hear this? Can you hear this?
1974.52s - 1976.52s |  Hi there, Daniel O'Day, please.
1976.52s - 1978.52s |  Uh, who's calling?
1978.52s - 1980.52s |  Uh, this is Dr. Michael Laufer.
1980.52s - 1985.15s |  Dr. Michael Laufer from the Four Thieves Vinegar collection, please.
1985.15s - 1989.10s |  Sorry, I can't understand what you're saying.
1989.10s - 1991.10s |  I'm sorry, the connection's bad.
1991.10s - 1994.10s |  Dr. Michael Laufer, I'm calling from Four Thieves.
1994.10s - 1996.10s |  He's expecting my call.
1997.10s - 1999.10s |  He's expecting your call?
1999.10s - 2001.10s |  Uh, yeah.
2001.10s - 2004.38s |  Hold on a second.
2004.38s - 2005.38s |  Thank you so much.
2005.38s - 2010.50s |  Yep, I'm still here.
2010.50s - 2020.69s |  Hold on.
2020.69s - 2021.69s |  I still can't understand who you are.
2021.69s - 2023.69s |  I'm sorry, can you say that again?
2023.69s - 2025.69s |  Yeah, Dr. Michael Laufer from the Four Thieves Vinegar collective.
2025.69s - 2027.69s |  I'm calling from Las Vegas.
2027.69s - 2032.43s |  Okay, your call.
2032.43s - 2034.43s |  Uh, well, can you put me on with him anyway?
2034.43s - 2039.73s |  Hi there, it's Dr. Michael Laufer.
2039.73s - 2041.73s |  I'm calling from the Four Thieves Vinegar collective.
2041.73s - 2046.93s |  I remember, but please don't call it again.
2047.93s - 2049.93s |  Well, you sure you don't want to chat?
2051.93s - 2057.06s |  Hello?
2057.06s - 2062.96s |  Well, I tried.
2062.96s - 2064.96s |  I was going to invite him down and everything.
2064.96s - 2070.20s |  All right, moving on.
2070.20s - 2074.20s |  How do you do DIY pharmaceuticals, even if you don't have help?
2074.20s - 2077.20s |  Again, you have to automate the chemistry.
2077.20s - 2079.20s |  You have to deal with the reaction.
2079.20s - 2085.20s |  And, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm cutting down on time.
2085.20s - 2090.20s |  So here, again, some of this stuff that I talked about, again, tomorrow at 11 a.m.,
2090.20s - 2094.20s |  Creator Stage 2, you can come by and you can get all the detail on this.
2094.20s - 2096.20s |  I'm going to skip down again.
2096.20s - 2101.20s |  And, uh, but you'll see, again, if you look in the, like, side column here,
2101.20s - 2104.20s |  you can see all of these really beautiful pictures of things.
2104.20s - 2107.20s |  But I'll show you just one little bit here.
2107.20s - 2110.20s |  Uh, I'm going to have to sort of jump back and forth.
2110.20s - 2114.20s |  But here's the, uh, here's the micro lab in all its glory.
2114.20s - 2117.20s |  And it's actually doing chemistry here.
2117.20s - 2119.20s |  Uh, this isn't going to work.
2119.20s - 2122.20s |  It was, uh, this was so slick when I put it together.
2122.20s - 2123.20s |  I apologize.
2123.20s - 2126.20s |  But here at the end, I'll show you this little bit.
2126.20s - 2130.20s |  You have your active pharmaceutical ingredient in the solution in this smaller jar.
2130.20s - 2136.20s |  And all you're going to do in the last step of most chemistry is just pour it through a coffee filter.
2136.20s - 2138.20s |  It's as simple as that.
2138.20s - 2141.20s |  And once you do, then you're going to sit there and you're going to let it drip.
2142.20s - 2146.20s |  And all of the impurities flow out and your active pharmaceutical ingredient is left.
2146.20s - 2149.20s |  And you just dry out the coffee filter.
2149.20s - 2153.92s |  And there's your drug.
2153.92s - 2158.92s |  Again, come by tomorrow and you'll see this all happen in real time.
2158.92s - 2160.92s |  Um, I already talked through these systems.
2160.92s - 2165.92s |  But, again, these are online services that we have, which we will show.
2165.92s - 2168.92s |  Uh, the Recipe Press is a brilliant piece of work.
2168.92s - 2170.92s |  Uh, Chemhactica is a brilliant piece of work.
2170.92s - 2173.92s |  But let me just talk about Sovaldi specifically.
2173.92s - 2175.92s |  Here it is rendered in two dimensions.
2175.92s - 2177.92s |  I'm sure you've seen this.
2177.92s - 2179.92s |  For those of you who are chemistry phobic, do not let this bother you.
2179.92s - 2181.92s |  I promise this is simple.
2181.92s - 2184.92s |  Our chemists are brilliant and did the hard work.
2184.92s - 2186.92s |  Here's what the reaction looks like.
2186.92s - 2189.92s |  And the amazing part of this is that it is only one step.
2189.92s - 2191.92s |  So, pay attention.
2191.92s - 2193.92s |  This will be very quick.
2193.92s - 2194.92s |  It will only take a moment.
2194.92s - 2196.92s |  Here's what you have.
2196.92s - 2200.92s |  On the right, you will see this ring with fluorines.
2200.92s - 2204.92s |  The fluorines and the oxygen will break off like this.
2204.92s - 2208.92s |  And you get that little extra stick that wants to connect to an oxygen.
2208.92s - 2210.92s |  And there's that lonely little oxygen on the other side.
2210.92s - 2213.92s |  And they're going to make friends.
2213.92s - 2217.92s |  And they do it like this.
2217.92s - 2219.92s |  And for those of you with good short-term memories,
2219.92s - 2223.92s |  you will see that this is indeed the molecule that we were trying to get at the beginning.
2223.92s - 2225.92s |  A single step.
2225.92s - 2227.92s |  And you can get this drug.
2227.92s - 2229.92s |  You want to see it in three dimensions?
2229.92s - 2231.92s |  Here you go.
2231.92s - 2232.92s |  Again.
2232.92s - 2234.92s |  The fluorines are the green.
2234.92s - 2236.92s |  The oxygens are the red.
2236.92s - 2238.92s |  You're going to see this piece break off.
2238.92s - 2241.92s |  And you're going to see this extra little stick.
2241.92s - 2244.92s |  And it wants to come around in a little smooch.
2244.92s - 2246.92s |  And there is Sovaldi.
2246.92s - 2251.92s |  Now, eventually, you're going to have to make bills.
2251.92s - 2255.92s |  They just passed a law that makes owning a pill press a felony.
2255.92s - 2257.92s |  Hilarious.
2257.92s - 2261.92s |  Because all you need is something that will press something.
2261.92s - 2263.92s |  I've had people tell me that reloading devices can do this.
2263.92s - 2266.92s |  A simple Arbor press will do it too.
2266.92s - 2268.92s |  Say you want a pill mold?
2268.92s - 2270.92s |  You can print one out of resin.
2270.92s - 2273.92s |  Then you take your active pharmaceutical ingredient.
2273.92s - 2275.92s |  You tap it in.
2275.92s - 2277.92s |  You fill it up.
2277.92s - 2279.92s |  You put the plunger in.
2279.92s - 2281.92s |  You press it down.
2281.92s - 2285.23s |  And then you spray it with glitter.
2285.23s - 2287.23s |  Why do you spray it with glitter?
2287.23s - 2290.23s |  Well, to put it in the words of one of our chemists,
2290.23s - 2294.23s |  if it doesn't sparkle, it's not my revolution.
2294.23s - 2308.53s |  I know I've put this figure up many times.
2308.53s - 2311.53s |  But it still horrifies me.
2311.53s - 2314.53s |  No matter how many times I see it.
2314.53s - 2317.53s |  This is a commercial Sovaldi pill.
2317.53s - 2322.26s |  This is a $1,000 bill.
2322.26s - 2324.26s |  Now, they're in circulation.
2324.26s - 2326.26s |  Not much.
2326.26s - 2328.26s |  But they're around.
2328.26s - 2330.26s |  You can find them.
2330.26s - 2336.03s |  They're mostly collector's items.
2336.03s - 2338.03s |  But you can get them.
2338.03s - 2340.03s |  Grover Cleveland, everybody.
2340.03s - 2342.03s |  $1,000.
2342.03s - 2344.03s |  How ridiculous is this?
2344.03s - 2349.03s |  Now, contrastingly, here's our little pill that we made for $3.50 worth of materials.
2349.03s - 2352.03s |  So here's a question.
2352.03s - 2354.03s |  Which would you pick?
2354.03s - 2358.28s |  Now, I happen to have one of these pills.
2358.28s - 2361.91s |  What would you pick?
2361.91s - 2365.29s |  The bill or the pill?
2365.29s - 2369.70s |  So who would take this collector's item?
2369.70s - 2371.70s |  Yeah?
2371.70s - 2375.81s |  All right, come up.
2375.81s - 2379.81s |  Now, these are actually worth more than $1,000 because they're so rare.
2379.81s - 2383.50s |  There you go.
2383.50s - 2385.50s |  Yours to keep.
2385.50s - 2387.50s |  Joke's on you, though.
2387.50s - 2389.50s |  It's counterfeit.
2389.50s - 2394.26s |  So you're actually in violation of a whole bunch of laws right now because you took that from me.
2394.26s - 2396.26s |  But realistically, this is not counterfeit.
2396.26s - 2398.26s |  It's pirated.
2398.26s - 2400.26s |  There's a difference.
2400.26s - 2402.26s |  This doesn't try to look like something it's not.
2402.26s - 2408.26s |  This does the exact same thing as the thing that it's trying to be.
2408.26s - 2410.26s |  And it doesn't have to try.
2410.26s - 2423.26s |  This is both chemically and isomorphically identical to anything that you would get in a pharmacy if you had the money.
2423.26s - 2427.26s |  Now, I get this question a lot.
2427.26s - 2432.26s |  Now, of course, the point of all of this is that you don't have to test it.
2432.26s - 2437.26s |  The systems are designed so that all of the care and attention you can get on the front end.
2437.26s - 2439.26s |  And then you don't have to.
2439.26s - 2442.26s |  But we did anyway.
2442.26s - 2452.26s |  Anybody out there who knows how to read a high-performance liquid chromatography readout will see that this is fucking amazing.
2452.26s - 2454.26s |  That spike is perfect.
2454.26s - 2456.26s |  There's only one thing in there.
2456.26s - 2460.26s |  For those of you who don't read these, here's something a little more quantitative.
2460.26s - 2464.93s |  And I will draw your attention to this number.
2464.93s - 2466.93s |  That's the purity.
2466.93s - 2480.65s |  Before you get too impressed, allow me to say, if you were to buy Sovaldi in the raw from a chemical supplier, you only get 98%.
2480.65s - 2490.65s |  And again, for those of you who are astute with numbers, you will notice this is an order of magnitude more pure than what you would get if you bought it.
2490.65s - 2495.15s |  Where'd my goon go? I need another shot.
2495.15s - 2497.15s |  Thank you, sir.
2497.15s - 2500.98s |  Watch this.
2500.98s - 2514.19s |  My team's watching, and they're all freaking out right now because I didn't tell them I was going to do this.
2514.19s - 2519.46s |  And I don't even have the hepatitis that I know of.
2519.46s - 2522.46s |  All right. Let's keep going.
2522.46s - 2524.46s |  I have five minutes.
2524.46s - 2526.46s |  Want to quote some other superheroes?
2526.46s - 2528.46s |  You'll notice this.
2528.46s - 2536.25s |  Now, this is the fourth time I'm mentioning this.
2536.25s - 2546.25s |  And I mention this because this entire course of treatment can be made for $300 in raw materials.
2546.25s - 2551.25s |  And I happen to have it right here.
2551.25s - 2556.25s |  Now, who said they had a friend who was infected with hepatitis?
2556.25s - 2558.25s |  There were a couple people.
2558.25s - 2562.10s |  Right here?
2562.10s - 2568.62s |  You. Come up here.
2568.62s - 2570.62s |  Keep your friend healthy. Keep them safe.
2570.62s - 2574.60s |  Thank you so much.
2574.60s - 2582.14s |  We should be doing this every day.
2582.14s - 2588.58s |  I get this question a lot.
2588.58s - 2593.82s |  I'm going to move on now.
2593.82s - 2599.82s |  Again, if you don't differentiate between morality and legality, one of us is in the wrong conference.
2599.82s - 2601.82s |  Again, none of our work scales up.
2601.82s - 2604.82s |  This is worth noting because those of you who are like, wow, he does stuff super cheap.
2604.82s - 2606.82s |  Maybe I could start a business.
2606.82s - 2608.82s |  I mean, go nuts, right?
2608.82s - 2610.82s |  But you're going to be wasting it.
2610.82s - 2612.82s |  Talk to a chemical engineer.
2612.82s - 2614.82s |  Scaling chemistry is very difficult.
2614.82s - 2616.82s |  When you do it on a small scale, it's much easier.
2616.82s - 2618.82s |  And additionally, some people are like, oh, that's super exciting.
2618.82s - 2620.82s |  How do I get one?
2620.82s - 2622.82s |  You make it.
2622.82s - 2624.82s |  We don't sell anything.
2624.82s - 2626.82s |  We don't even sell merch.
2626.82s - 2633.74s |  We have a merch page on our website showing you how you can make your own.
2633.74s - 2635.74s |  You've all seen this stamp.
2635.74s - 2637.74s |  This is when an authority figure tells you you're allowed.
2637.74s - 2639.74s |  Now, some people decided this might look cute.
2639.74s - 2643.74s |  But you will never see this on anything ever.
2643.74s - 2649.74s |  Because we are not an authority figure, and we are not telling you what to think or what to do.
2649.74s - 2661.74s |  The only thing that the Four Thieves Vinegar Collective will ever approve is you making your own decisions about your own health.
2661.74s - 2663.74s |  And that we've already approved.
2663.74s - 2665.74s |  So, go on and do the thing.
2665.74s - 2672.96s |  I'm running low on time.
2672.96s - 2680.96s |  So I'm going to skip this slide, but we have some more deep ideological ideas that I would rant about if I had more on the clock.
2680.96s - 2688.13s |  Again, come to the Biohacking Village tomorrow.
2688.13s - 2691.38s |  You'll be able to see everything.
2691.38s - 2693.38s |  This is an American phrase, isn't it?
2693.38s - 2697.38s |  I'm going to add another one from the same genre.
2697.38s - 2704.88s |  And with this, I would like to address the feds out there.
2704.88s - 2708.88s |  And some of the execs from pharmacy.
2708.88s - 2710.88s |  I've spotted some of you during the day.
2710.88s - 2712.88s |  And I'd like to say the following.
2712.88s - 2716.88s |  I would rather be singing your praises.
2716.88s - 2722.88s |  I would like it much better if you did your work properly.
2722.88s - 2726.88s |  So that our work became obsolete and we could go do something else.
2726.88s - 2736.88s |  But until you do, if you would like to stop me, you will have to send assassins.
2736.88s - 2756.88s |  Because, so long as you stand between people and the medicines they need, due to your greed, or your ignorance, or your cowardice, I will fight you until I curse you with my dying breath.
2756.88s - 2760.88s |  And when you kill me, it won't matter much.
2760.88s - 2762.88s |  I'm just another human.
2762.88s - 2768.88s |  Like the thousands who die from your inaction every day.
2768.88s - 2772.88s |  And the other members of Four Thieves will step in to continue the work.
2772.88s - 2780.88s |  And the future members of Four Thieves that are probably sitting right next to you now will come to join them.
2780.88s - 2782.88s |  And the ones far away we haven't even met yet.
2782.88s - 2787.88s |  Because we are fighting for nothing less than our lives.
2787.88s - 2796.06s |  Help is not on the way.
2796.06s - 2798.06s |  I will say this last.
2798.06s - 2802.06s |  My fellow hackers, come join us.
2802.06s - 2806.06s |  And we have one last tool that everyone can use.
2806.06s - 2809.06s |  And you don't need to read anything about it.
2809.06s - 2813.06s |  And you don't need to build anything.
2813.06s - 2824.06s |  The next time a medical officer says you can't have what you need, look them in the eye and say, if you will not help me, I will make this myself.
2824.06s - 2826.06s |  Because that's the truth.
2826.06s - 2828.06s |  You can.
2828.06s - 2830.06s |  Thank you so much.
