**Introduction to Mobile Network Traffic Analysis**
- Importance of knowing where and how mobile and IoT devices communicate
- Challenges with monitoring devices using modern mobile networks like 4G and 5G
- Introduction to private Access Point Names (**APNs**) as a solution

**Speaker Background**
- Aapo Oksman, expertise in IoT, **security research**, and consulting
- Involvement in cryptography, network protocols, and bug bounty programs

**Challenges with IoT and Mobile Devices**
- IoT devices often have limited connectivity options beyond **Ethernet** or **Wi-Fi**
- Industrial IoT devices may rely solely on mobile networks for connectivity
- Difficulty in monitoring **5G** traffic from mobile devices

**Reasons to Analyze Mobile Network Traffic**
- Curiosity and **privacy** concerns
