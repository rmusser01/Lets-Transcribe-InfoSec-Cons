0.00s - 5.12s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 All right. So today we're going to talk about how to make badges. So you're probably wondering who
5.12s - 12.08s |  am I? My name is Cold Brew. I am a solutions architect at my day job, the founder and lead
12.08s - 17.60s |  hacker at ROT13 Labs, and I am the organizer of High Roller Con, or one of the organizers.
18.32s - 21.68s |  If you see those little ducks everywhere for High Roller Con, those were us.
22.64s - 27.84s |  I'm also a hardware hacker noob. And why do I say that? I say that because I am not an electrical
27.84s - 32.72s |  engineer. I am not someone who's been doing this for 10 years. I'm just a dude who figured out how
32.72s - 37.36s |  to do it by tinkering. And that means that all of you can do it too. This is not something that
37.36s - 41.68s |  requires you to be some kind of crazy wizard. It's stuff that anybody can do if you just take
41.68s - 45.60s |  the time and tinker with it. And that's kind of what a lot of this talk is about.
47.04s - 50.72s |  If you'd like to follow me on things, this is kind of a list of all the social networks I'm on,
50.72s - 54.72s |  basically in order of how often I'm on them. So if you're trying to hit me up on Discord,
54.72s - 64.66s |  I may not respond for a week or two. All right, so what are we going to talk about during this
64.66s - 67.70s |  talk? We're going to, I'm going to try to go through as much of it as I can, because we've
67.70s - 72.42s |  got a live demo at the end, and I really want to get to that. So first we're going to talk about
72.42s - 76.34s |  how to come up with an idea. If you're going to make a badge, you've got to have an idea for it.
76.34s - 80.02s |  The next thing is planning out the hardware, making sure that you know exactly how it's
80.02s - 84.26s |  going to work, and you know, all of those kind of things. Planning out your firmware to make
84.26s - 88.74s |  sure that the hardware can actually do the things you want it to do. Coming up with packaging and
88.74s - 93.38s |  accessories if you want to include things like that with it. Planning out the budget, making
93.38s - 100.10s |  sure that you've got kind of all your t's crossed and all your i's dots, and then making the badge.
100.10s - 104.58s |  So we're going to try and get through as much of this as we can. So a quick disclaimer before we
104.58s - 110.66s |  dive into this too much, this is not like the right way to make a badge. There is no right way.
110.66s - 114.58s |  Everyone has a different way they like to make badges. Every time I talk to a badge maker,
114.58s - 119.86s |  I learn some new way to do it. This is just how I make them. I have a lot of people after Defcon
119.86s - 126.77s |  usually coming up and asking me about how I do it. This is how I do it. Okay, so the first thing
126.77s - 132.37s |  is coming up with the idea. In a conversation with Altbeer about a year ago, we were talking
132.37s - 136.61s |  about badges, and he said the hardest part of making badges is coming up with a good idea.
137.33s - 143.89s |  And this just stuck with me because this is so true. This is the hardest part. Once you know
143.89s - 147.09s |  what you're going to build, the rest of the steps, they happen easily. You can just read
147.09s - 152.05s |  documentation, you can figure things out, you can tinker. However you're going to do it, you can
152.05s - 156.45s |  make the badge. But the idea, that's the part that you really have to work on and make sure it's
156.45s - 162.13s |  something you're really going to be excited to build. So some things to think about when you're
162.13s - 166.37s |  coming up with your design. How do you want it to look? Like what shape do you want it to be in?
166.37s - 169.89s |  Do you want it to be abstract? Do you want it to look like a dog? You know, whatever you want it
169.89s - 174.05s |  to be. And then once you know that, then you're going to have to figure out, okay, the shape,
174.05s - 178.29s |  the color, the size of it. Do you want it to be huge? Do you want it to be a little tiny thing,
178.29s - 183.73s |  maybe an SAO? Where's the lanyard going to go if it's going to have a lanyard? Do you want to do
183.73s - 187.89s |  the dual hook ones or do you want to do the single hooks? All of these things are going to affect
187.89s - 192.93s |  your design on this. The next thing is what do you want it to actually do? Or do you want it to
192.93s - 197.01s |  do anything at all? Sometimes people just like the blinky, and that's fine too. Sometimes they
197.01s - 201.57s |  want it to have really, really intense features. Whatever it is, you need to know what it's going
201.57s - 207.25s |  to do before you start really diving into this. How are you going to power all this? You might
207.25s - 211.73s |  need a big lipo. You might be able to get away with the little 2032s. And the last thing is
211.73s - 215.57s |  what's your budget? You've got to make sure that whatever you're trying to build is realistic for
215.57s - 219.65s |  that budget. And think about the fact that you're not, or probably not at least, just going to be
219.65s - 223.57s |  making one or two of these. You might be making hundreds of them. So these are all things to
223.57s - 229.41s |  consider. And the last thing about that is be prepared to dump some money into this. It's not
229.41s - 233.41s |  cheap. I'm not trying to scare you away from it or anything because it, you know, you can do it
233.41s - 238.29s |  on a budget. But if you're trying to make something really intense and you might have to iterate a few
238.29s - 242.45s |  times, and usually places don't like to fulfill orders of just one badge, so you're probably
242.45s - 246.53s |  making five at a time. And when it comes to your house and it doesn't work, all that money's down
246.53s - 251.09s |  the drain. You've got to figure out how it should work and then order another batch and hope that
251.09s - 257.41s |  one works. So make sure that you're ready to actually put some money into this. Okay, so these
257.41s - 261.01s |  are some of the badges that I've made in the past just to kind of give you some idea of things.
261.65s - 265.65s |  I mean, some of these are, I try to get kind of a good range of like different sizes, different
265.65s - 270.93s |  styles, different things. But it's something where you've got to think about the coloring, the size,
270.93s - 276.05s |  the shape, all of that. And these are some good examples of things that I've made. We can kind of
276.05s - 283.09s |  get into them as we keep going, but just a few ideas. So now that you've got your idea,
283.09s - 286.53s |  you've decided exactly what you're going to make. Now you can start to plan out that hardware.
287.41s - 294.13s |  Is it just going to blink? If so, all you need is some LEDs and the CH2032 is probably enough
294.13s - 298.77s |  for you. Okay? Those are the little coin cells that sometimes the DEF CON badges run off of.
300.05s - 304.53s |  You've got to think about your LEDs. They have those self-blinking LEDs. They're dead simple
304.53s - 309.41s |  to use. I love using those in badges because it gives you some functionality. It gives you
309.41s - 315.41s |  something that's blinking or flashing or whatever without having to use a microcontroller. Those
315.41s - 319.57s |  usually also have a built-in resistor. So that's another part that you don't have to use. It makes
319.57s - 324.37s |  your bomb tiny. It makes the amount of parts you have to acquire tiny. It just makes your life a
324.37s - 330.69s |  lot easier, especially if you're trying to build something simple. SMD versus through-hole. SMD is
330.69s - 335.89s |  surface mount devices. Those are the ones that mount on the surface. Through-hole is the ones
335.89s - 341.25s |  that are actually going through the board. These can kind of change your design pretty wildly.
341.25s - 344.61s |  For the little duck SAOs this year, we did the through-hole ones because we thought it'd be
344.61s - 348.77s |  easier for people to solder on their own. But now when it comes time for us to solder 30,000 of
348.77s - 354.93s |  these, you know, we just can't do it easily. So we ended up only soldering 1,000 of them ourselves.
354.93s - 358.93s |  But 1,000 ducks is a lot to solder. So we're kind of regretting that decision. But
359.57s - 364.61s |  it's something to think about. If you're doing the SMD stuff, you can also do things like reverse
364.61s - 370.37s |  mounting. So this badge here is a perfect example where we did reverse mount LEDs on the back of
370.37s - 374.69s |  the board so that it shines through the board and kind of gives you that little effect you can see
374.69s - 378.21s |  there with the blue and the red. And those were the self-blinking ones, so we couldn't catch all
378.21s - 383.25s |  four of them lit up at the same time. But you get the idea. You can do a lot with just LEDs and
383.25s - 388.61s |  still make a really cool badge. Another thing I always tell people is that if you're making a very,
388.61s - 392.85s |  very simple badge, but you want to give it a little more flexibility or give it just
392.85s - 399.89s |  a little something extra, consider an SAO port. Technically, the SAO standard is supposed to have
399.89s - 405.41s |  all six pins doing different things. But if you just put power and ground, that's all most SAOs
405.41s - 410.85s |  use in the first place anyway. So it gives you a very easy way to add a little extra functionality
410.85s - 417.28s |  for people to expand upon your badge. Okay, so if you do want to go with functionality,
417.28s - 420.88s |  you want it to do something, you want it to have Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, whatever it is,
421.44s - 424.24s |  you got to think about how much processing power you're going to need for this.
425.52s - 430.08s |  There's tons and tons of MCUs out there. I'm not going to talk about all of them.
430.08s - 434.72s |  But the ones that I like to use for the larger power things where I need more processing power
434.72s - 440.72s |  is something like the ATmega328P or the RPi2040. These are really, I'm just giving these examples
440.72s - 444.40s |  so you've got at least an idea in your head if you're starting to look into these things. Those
444.40s - 448.72s |  are the ones that I have found are very easy to work with. They're very simple, they're beginner
448.72s - 453.60s |  friendly, but they give you a lot of power. The next thing to think about is things like
453.60s - 458.32s |  Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. A lot of badges these days have those things. Something like that,
458.32s - 464.40s |  you're going to have to go for something like the ESP8266 or the ESP32 series. The 8266 is going to
464.40s - 469.60s |  give you Wi-Fi, the 32 will usually give you Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Make sure you're checking
469.60s - 474.08s |  the documentation though because not all of them are going to give you those exact things.
474.72s - 479.20s |  You've got to make sure you check the documentation. I have done this before where I ordered a chip
479.20s - 484.08s |  thinking it had something, ordered the boards, got them in, soldered it all up. Turns out it doesn't
484.08s - 489.20s |  work because I ordered the wrong chips. So learn from my mistakes and make sure you're reading the
489.20s - 496.64s |  docs on these things. The last thing to think about is how many GPIO do you need? So on that
496.64s - 503.04s |  one, if you're going to need a lot of GPIO, something like the ATmega32 or that CH32V003,
503.04s - 509.44s |  that's the new RISC-V chip. It gives you a ton of GPIO for like 10 cents a chip or something like
509.44s - 514.00s |  that. They're super cheap, but they're pretty new. So they're a little bit harder to work with,
514.00s - 518.16s |  which is another thing you want to consider when you're picking your MCU is how long has this been
518.16s - 523.44s |  around? Is there a lot of documentation? Is there a lot of community support? Those are the big
523.44s - 530.80s |  things you want to be looking at. Okay. So what is a GPIO? I know someone's going to be asking
530.80s - 536.08s |  this. That is a general purpose input output. Those are the pins on the MCU. Those are the
536.08s - 540.40s |  things that actually do something. So if you want to put a sensor or you want to blink an LED,
541.12s - 545.68s |  anything that is an input or an output, you're going to need a GPIO for that.
546.32s - 551.36s |  You can do some tricky things to get extra GPIO out of your badges, but realistically,
551.36s - 560.14s |  you want to have one GPIO per thing that you want it to do. Here's some quick examples of
560.14s - 564.62s |  pins that have a lot of GPIO. Some of those are through holes. Some of those are surface mount,
564.62s - 569.26s |  but it at least gives you an idea of all those pins are different things you can do. For these
569.26s - 576.86s |  keyboards here, you have to use one GPIO for each row of keys and for each column of keys.
577.42s - 581.50s |  And that way you can pinpoint which key was clicked. So obviously for the larger keyboards,
581.50s - 586.38s |  you're going to need a lot more GPIO. So it's just something to think about if you're building
586.38s - 593.39s |  something that has a lot of functionality. Okay. So you've got your idea. You can plan
593.39s - 598.59s |  out your hardware now. Now you can look at the power. Okay. So how long do you want it to run
598.59s - 606.11s |  for? My rule of thumb is usually if it's rechargeable, I want it to last at least 24 hours
606.11s - 609.95s |  so that people can play with it at the con. They can go home at night when they're about to pass
609.95s - 615.47s |  out and plug it in to recharge it and have it for the full next day. If it's not going to be
615.47s - 620.43s |  a rechargeable battery, I want it to last the whole con. I want people to be able to leave it
620.43s - 627.30s |  on, forget about it, fall asleep with it turned on and still be running the next day. I mean,
627.30s - 630.82s |  realistically, you could make things that power for months. I really doubt you need that, but
631.46s - 638.42s |  it's an option. When it comes to using power, the heavy hitters are usually things like NeoPixels
638.42s - 644.02s |  and Wi-Fi. NeoPixels, there's a lot of tricks you can do to make them use a little bit less power,
644.02s - 648.18s |  but if you really want that color cycling where you control what colors they are and how they move,
648.82s - 654.18s |  it's going to cost you a bit of power. The last thing to think about is do you need a charge
654.18s - 657.70s |  circuit? And that's going to be if you're doing the LiPo batteries and you want to be able to
657.70s - 663.30s |  recharge that. Some MCUs will have that built in. So again, you'll have to read the documentation
663.30s - 667.62s |  and see, is this something that I need to build on my own or is this something that my MCU comes
667.62s - 674.98s |  with? Now I chose this badge for this slide because this is one of the spaces where I really
674.98s - 680.02s |  screwed up and I really regretted it. So this is a lesson for y'all to learn from my mistake here
680.66s - 686.10s |  is I used one of these, I think it was called a CH123 battery and they're not rechargeable,
686.10s - 689.30s |  so you have to click it out and click a new one in every time you want to use it.
689.30s - 696.10s |  I was using Wi-Fi and NeoPixels on this badge and it did not last a day. And once it died,
696.82s - 701.22s |  where are you supposed to get one of these? So this was for Wild West Hack and Fest. Those who
701.22s - 705.46s |  have been to that, you know, there's not a lot of places to get batteries out there in the middle
705.46s - 712.42s |  of Deadwood. So when these badges died, you were just kind of out of luck. So I included an extra
712.42s - 718.10s |  battery with each one, but you know, it was an area where I regret that. So make sure if you're
718.10s - 722.10s |  going to use a battery that can be swapped out, make sure you're using something that people can
722.10s - 726.82s |  actually get their hands on when they want to get new, you know, replace that battery.
729.79s - 732.75s |  Okay. So we're ready to build our thing, whatever it may be.
734.19s - 741.39s |  So I usually skip this part. You should not skip this part. This is just me being lazy and not
741.39s - 747.15s |  wanting to do it, but just for full disclosure, I usually end up skipping this. I do regret it
747.15s - 752.43s |  later most of the time. This is going to save you a lot of headaches and this is going to allow you
752.43s - 756.27s |  to be able to send your circuit to other badge makers or other, you know, electrical engineers
756.27s - 760.43s |  or whatever and say, Hey, why is this not working? Or, Hey, is this going to work?
761.79s - 766.11s |  So we'll talk a little bit more about these later on, but you're going to want to draw it out. Okay.
766.11s - 771.63s |  And this is something where you can see there, there's the ATtiny85 and it's going to some
771.63s - 776.27s |  resistors and it's going to a USB port. And it allows you to actually check out what your
776.27s - 779.55s |  circuit's going to do and how it's going to do it to make sure all the connections are there,
779.55s - 789.06s |  you know, and it's going to work. So shameless plug, a buddy of mine, Relay Moth,
789.62s - 795.78s |  he actually sells t-shirts of that circuit. So I've got one on right here. We have a few of them
795.78s - 799.38s |  over at the Cyber Swamp Lords booth, but most of them have sold out, but you can get them online
799.38s - 805.54s |  if that's something that you guys like. So once you have built out your circuit, now's when you're
805.54s - 810.42s |  going to want to breadboard that. So you're going to build it with actual parts, but without a PCB.
810.42s - 814.34s |  You're just jamming wires into a breadboard and connecting everything up to make sure that it
814.34s - 820.18s |  works. You can kind of do little tricks like just touching wires together to simulate clicking a
820.18s - 824.90s |  button. You can start to build out your firmware at this phase if it actually needs firmware,
824.90s - 829.14s |  like if you're using an MCU and you want it to have Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or whatever, this is when
829.14s - 833.70s |  you can start building that and make sure that the hardware that you're choosing can actually do the
833.70s - 844.26s |  things you want it to do. Also, I usually skip this step too. So don't listen to me, just do
844.26s - 851.57s |  what you're supposed to do. So that leads into planning out the firmware. Usually Arduino IDE
851.57s - 856.45s |  is a great place to start for this. They have ways to be able to test out all kinds of functionality
856.45s - 861.09s |  on all kinds of different chipsets. They just make it a lot easier to develop on, especially
861.09s - 866.69s |  if you're just getting started. What I always tell people is if you just Google the functionality
866.69s - 872.13s |  that you want, chances are someone else has done something that's very close to that. Even if it's
872.13s - 876.37s |  not super close to it, even if it's kind of a little bit off, you can usually just steal chunks
876.37s - 881.81s |  of that and start mashing things together to build out the firmware you want. Those Fox badges that I
881.81s - 887.17s |  built a few years ago, if anybody knows about those, they were really just a hop gobble of a
887.17s - 890.37s |  bunch of other people's code that I was able to string together and make it work.
891.89s - 895.73s |  You know, it's a simple way to start, especially if you're not great with writing firmware like me,
896.29s - 901.89s |  it's a good way to get it going. So as long as you're using an MCU, some other ideas to think
901.89s - 906.85s |  about adding in there is things like a CTF, things like feature flags, there's things like a debug
906.85s - 912.85s |  mode, and again the SAO. Things like that are a great way to add functionality onto your badge
913.41s - 917.17s |  without really, you know, needing to change the hardware at all.
919.25s - 923.97s |  So we had talked before about how SAO is a standard. This is the actual pinout for it.
923.97s - 928.05s |  So you've got your three volt in your ground, then you've got a data and clock, and then you've got
928.05s - 934.05s |  two GPIO. And that's just something where this is, if you want it to be a full SAO, this is what
934.05s - 938.53s |  people are referring to. But again, you can just do that three volt in the ground and you're probably
938.53s - 944.21s |  going to be just fine. Also, some badge makers do not necessarily do 3.3 volt. I've seen badges
944.21s - 950.21s |  that are sending six volt here. Maybe don't do that, because that might blow up someone's SAO,
950.21s - 957.87s |  but people do it. Okay, so packaging and accessories. This is an area where I always
957.87s - 962.51s |  like to do a lot more. I know some badge makers, they just like to hand you a bag with the badge
962.51s - 967.71s |  in it, and that's fine too. But I always think it's a lot more fun when badges come with like
967.71s - 972.91s |  really cool packaging, and they come with cool accessories, and it's this whole experience that
972.91s - 977.39s |  you've built for someone rather than just handing them the badge. I always like doing that, so I
977.39s - 982.51s |  always encourage others to do the same thing. If you're going to do this, the thing to think about
982.51s - 987.87s |  when you're doing it is, what do you actually need to use this badge? Like if I handed you the badge,
987.87s - 992.51s |  what would you need to just turn it on and use it right now? And then there's things like,
992.51s - 997.63s |  what would you want to get with this badge? So the needs, I have things like USB cable,
997.63s - 1002.19s |  batteries, antenna, any of those kinds of things where it's like to be able to use this badge
1002.83s - 1007.87s |  straight out the gate. Those are the kinds of things you would need. The things that are wants
1007.87s - 1013.15s |  are things like the sticker, or you know, an extra SAO that comes with the badge, or the case for it,
1013.15s - 1017.95s |  or whatever. Any of those things are things that it would be great to have that, but you don't
1017.95s - 1024.29s |  really need it. Okay, so you've got all your ideas, you know what parts you're going to use,
1024.29s - 1028.05s |  you know what accessories you're going to include and all that, where the hell do you find it all?
1029.01s - 1033.89s |  So I always tell people there's basically three tiers that you can go through to actually get
1033.89s - 1040.61s |  this. There's your fast shipping kind of highest cost tier, and obviously that's Amazon. These are
1040.61s - 1046.29s |  the kind of parts where you don't want to be buying your production parts off of Amazon.
1046.29s - 1049.25s |  You're going to pay an arm and a leg. You're going to get them tomorrow, but you're going
1049.25s - 1054.77s |  to pay an arm and a leg for it. But these are perfect if you get in a jam, or when you're
1054.77s - 1059.33s |  prototyping. When you're prototyping, you probably don't want to have to sit around waiting two weeks
1059.33s - 1064.29s |  to get some parts just to try them out and be like, oh that wasn't what I needed. Use Amazon,
1064.29s - 1067.17s |  get them on there real quick, because you're only buying one or two of them.
1068.45s - 1073.01s |  The mid-tier stuff is usually takes around a week of shipping. You can get them faster,
1073.01s - 1077.17s |  but it's usually going to be sometime around a week. And these are things like Digikey, Mouser,
1077.17s - 1081.89s |  Aero. I know there's plenty more, but those are the ones that I've used and had good luck with.
1082.85s - 1088.13s |  These ones are going to be very reliable parts distributors, but they do take a little bit more
1088.13s - 1091.89s |  time. You're going to get bulk pricing and things like that, and the more you buy, the more you're
1091.89s - 1098.37s |  going to save on those ones. Those are usually where you want to go for things like MCUs,
1098.37s - 1101.73s |  where it needs to be solid, it needs to work, it needs to be authentic.
1102.69s - 1107.41s |  And the final one is the low-cost, long ship times, and this is things like AliExpress.
1107.97s - 1112.93s |  You can also use Teemu or Alibaba or any of those as well, but any of these, you're going to have
1112.93s - 1117.73s |  to wait for these parts, but they're going to be dirt cheap, no matter how many you're buying.
1118.37s - 1124.77s |  The one problem with this tier is that they're not necessarily authentic. I've had friends that
1124.77s - 1129.09s |  have ordered a bunch of parts from AliExpress, they get them, and three quarters of them don't
1129.17s - 1136.69s |  work, and they're obvious fakes. This is something where, to me, I like to order simple things like
1136.69s - 1143.01s |  resistors or LEDs or things like that. I like to order those from AliExpress to get the better
1143.01s - 1148.29s |  deal on them, but anything like an MCU where I need it to be good, I need it to work, and I need
1148.29s - 1153.17s |  it to be authentic, I'll order that from that mid-tier. You can kind of choose to slice this
1153.17s - 1159.12s |  however you want, that's just how I like to do it. Okay, so what is all this going to actually
1159.12s - 1165.36s |  cost you? I've drawn out the way that I plan budgets, and these numbers are just made up,
1165.36s - 1169.84s |  but this is how I like to do it, is I like to get all of my different things that I'm going to buy,
1169.84s - 1174.64s |  so the PCBs, the components, batteries, lanyards, accessories, cases, whatever,
1175.20s - 1178.96s |  and put down how much the complete order of that thing is going to cost,
1179.84s - 1184.80s |  then how many units I'm going to make, and a total cost to make it. So that is like,
1184.80s - 1190.24s |  if I had to invest, you know, in this case, $325 to prototype this out,
1190.24s - 1194.64s |  you know, I ordered that many parts and boards and, you know, whatever to build this thing.
1196.32s - 1200.72s |  Oh, whoops, sorry, that's time spent on dev. Total cost to make would be all of those items
1200.72s - 1206.24s |  totaled up, which gives me that cost per unit. From there, you can kind of estimate your shipping
1206.24s - 1209.84s |  if you want to include that, put what price you're planning on charging, and have this
1209.84s - 1214.48s |  calculate like how much profit are you going to make off of these badges if you sell all of them.
1215.04s - 1219.20s |  And also, what is your breakeven point? How many of these badges do you have to sell
1219.84s - 1222.40s |  to just offset the cost that you spent to make it?
1225.84s - 1230.96s |  Let's see here. Yeah, so another thing is kind of your prototyping and discovery costs,
1230.96s - 1235.60s |  but also your equipment costs. Some people like to include that. I usually consider equipment
1235.60s - 1239.60s |  that I bought to build a badge something that I would probably buy anyway for my hobbies, so
1240.24s - 1243.36s |  I don't usually include them, but it is something to think about.
1246.00s - 1250.00s |  Okay, so we're finally about to get to the demo here soon, but there's a couple things we want
1250.00s - 1255.44s |  to go over before we do that. So I had mentioned we'd come back to designing the circuit. So this
1255.44s - 1260.96s |  is the circuit that we're going to try to kind of get as far into as we can with building. So with
1260.96s - 1267.04s |  this one, we're going to use the ESP-01S. This is kind of a very small ESP unit that gets us just a
1267.04s - 1273.12s |  few IO, but it gets us Wi-Fi, which is what we're going to do with this. It's easy to work with.
1273.12s - 1277.92s |  It's very simple to solder, especially for first-time solderers. So we're going to go with
1277.92s - 1281.92s |  that one. We're going to go with a little one-inch OLED screen so we can actually see what we're
1281.92s - 1286.72s |  working with. We're going to go with the AAA batteries because they're simple. AAA batteries
1286.72s - 1292.48s |  are going to give us 4.5 volts. All this stuff we're using needs 3.3 volts, so we're going to
1292.48s - 1298.48s |  have to use a linear regulator to cut that power down from 4.5 to that 3.3 that we need.
1300.32s - 1303.28s |  Then we're going to include a little header so that we can actually program this thing
1303.92s - 1310.91s |  and, you know, simple things like buttons, LED, and switch. Okay, so you're probably thinking,
1310.91s - 1316.91s |  how do I know which of those GPIO I need to be using to do this? And the answer is simple. It's
1316.91s - 1323.23s |  the documentation. Okay, so when you're looking through this documentation for your MCU or
1323.23s - 1328.91s |  whatever it is that you're going to actually be using, they are very long documents. And
1328.91s - 1333.07s |  especially if you're just getting started, they can be really, really overwhelming to look at.
1333.71s - 1341.71s |  So even if you skip 99% of it, the things that you really need to look at is the pin definitions.
1342.83s - 1348.35s |  This is going to show you what each pin does and what it, or I should say what it can do,
1348.35s - 1354.19s |  because not every pin can do everything. So this shows you all the pins that your
1354.19s - 1359.23s |  board offers, or your MCU offers, and then the list of things that it can do. But it also shows
1359.23s - 1365.31s |  you what they call the active and the boot time for those pins. These are important because it's
1365.31s - 1371.23s |  going to say high or low, and that tells you that it's going to be putting out power or not putting
1371.23s - 1376.75s |  out power during the boot time or while it's turned on. So this is important because if it's
1376.75s - 1384.83s |  supposed to be held high at boot time, but you have it cut off, it's not going to boot. So make
1384.83s - 1388.19s |  sure that you're paying attention to these things and understanding how they're going to work.
1389.39s - 1393.63s |  The next thing you need to pay attention to in this is the typical application section.
1394.27s - 1398.99s |  Usually it's going to show a more circuit diagram, kind of like that bottom left there,
1398.99s - 1404.03s |  but it could also show just a picture of the unit itself. But what this is going to show you
1404.59s - 1411.39s |  is what you need to provide to this chip just to make it work. You can add your own stuff after
1411.39s - 1416.03s |  this to make it do whatever it is you need it to do, but these are the bare minimum of what you
1416.03s - 1423.15s |  need to make this thing turn on. So you'll see in the top one there, which is the ESP-01, they've
1423.15s - 1430.91s |  got a couple resistors there going from enable and reset to that 3.3 volt. But on the ESP-01S,
1430.91s - 1434.43s |  which is the one that we're going to use, they've eliminated those. They built those
1434.43s - 1440.83s |  internally on the MCU, so you no longer need those. So for us, our minimal circuit is literally just
1440.83s - 1445.31s |  that ground and the three volt, and then we need the RX and TX to be able to program it. That is
1445.31s - 1450.83s |  all we need to make this thing work. Now they also have a recommended circuit section sometimes.
1450.83s - 1455.55s |  This is not always there, but in this particular one, they had that recommended circuit there of
1455.55s - 1460.83s |  that power supply reference design. That's how we know that we're going to need that 3.3 volts
1461.79s - 1467.15s |  giving our badge significantly over that, which we are. So we essentially lifted out that one as
1467.15s - 1473.84s |  well that we're going to use for this badge. Okay, so when you design a PCB, there's going to be tons
1473.84s - 1479.84s |  of layers that it shows on here, and we'll show this once we get to the demo. But the layers,
1480.48s - 1484.40s |  some of them are additive and some of them are subtractive, and so this is kind of the hardest
1484.40s - 1489.12s |  part to get used to when you start using something like EasyEDA, which is the one that I'm going to
1489.12s - 1494.16s |  be showing you guys today. So there's the top and bottom layer, and this is the actual copper
1494.16s - 1499.36s |  layer on your board. These are additive, which means that whatever I draw on my board on the
1499.36s - 1505.12s |  top and bottom layers, they're going to put copper in that shape or in that design or connecting
1505.12s - 1510.48s |  those things. Then there's the top silk and bottom silk layer. These are the silk screen,
1510.48s - 1515.36s |  so if you have the traditional green PCB with the white writing on it, the silk screen is that white
1515.36s - 1519.84s |  writing. And this one is additive as well, so anything that I write or draw or whatever,
1519.84s - 1523.36s |  it's all going to show up in white or whatever my silk screen layer is.
1524.48s - 1529.44s |  Then there's the top paste mask and bottom paste mask layers. These are what's known as the stencil
1529.44s - 1534.80s |  layer. This is where if you were ordering a stencil for SMT so you could just squeegee your solder
1534.80s - 1540.96s |  paste on there, this is the layer that they would cut out for that. So this is when you want to
1540.96s - 1546.64s |  expose the copper or expose the PCB itself. These are subtractive, so anything that you draw
1546.64s - 1553.76s |  on these layers, it's going to cut that off of the stencil layer. Top solder mask and bottom
1553.76s - 1559.84s |  solder mask is very similar to this. This is the actual solder mask, so on the green and white PCB,
1559.84s - 1566.24s |  this is the green part. Usually in EasyEDA, if you draw something on either the top paste mask
1566.24s - 1570.48s |  or top solder mask, they're just going to cut it out anyway, so they effectively work the same way,
1570.48s - 1574.88s |  but they are separate layers. So this one is also subtractive. It's going to cut out whatever you
1574.88s - 1580.80s |  draw. Then there's a couple of different layers that are kind of more used for the actual building
1580.80s - 1586.56s |  of the PCB itself. So this is the board outline layer, where that's actually the shape of your
1586.56s - 1591.36s |  badge. And there's multi-layer, which is things like through-hole components or if you drill a
1591.36s - 1597.20s |  hole in the badge or things like that. Then there's the rat lines. Rat lines is if you have all of your
1598.08s - 1602.24s |  pins set up in such a way where you have labeled the nets. So if you have a ground pin over here
1602.24s - 1606.88s |  and a ground pin over here, but you didn't connect them, a rat line is where it's going to draw a big
1606.88s - 1610.56s |  blue line across your screen saying, hey, these are supposed to be connected, but you haven't
1610.56s - 1614.88s |  connected them yet. So that's just to help you. It's not going to be printed on the board or
1614.88s - 1619.76s |  anything. It's just to help you design it. And that's same with the document layer. The document
1619.76s - 1624.96s |  layer is there so that you can make labels for things that will not be printed onto the board.
1625.92s - 1631.28s |  Now, a special note about that one. It's not supposed to be printed on the board.
1631.28s - 1635.52s |  That doesn't mean that your fab will not screw up and accidentally print it on the board.
1635.52s - 1641.76s |  So make sure before you click go on a massive order that they have not put the document layer
1641.76s - 1647.89s |  on there because I've had some friends that it just happened to recently. Okay. So here's the
1647.89s - 1651.81s |  demo time. We're going to see if this works. Everyone pray to the demo gods. We're going to
1651.81s - 1657.33s |  try and crank through as much of this badge as possible. And yeah, we'll see how it goes.
1662.72s - 1668.96s |  Okay. So I said earlier that the program that I like to use to build these is called easy EDA.
1669.52s - 1672.56s |  I usually use the online one, but just so I wouldn't have to worry about internet.
1674.16s - 1680.45s |  I've got the local one here. So when you're first starting out,
1681.97s - 1684.13s |  you're going to come in here and you're going to say you want a new project.
1685.65s - 1688.69s |  We're going to call this Nibbler because we're going to build Nibbler from Futurama.
1690.05s - 1693.57s |  So the first thing it's going to give you is this to draw your circuit diagram. We've already done
1693.57s - 1697.25s |  that. So we're just going to go ahead and skip past that. We're going to come over here and say
1697.25s - 1703.25s |  that we want a new PCB. Now it's going to show you a lot of things here about, okay, how do you want
1703.25s - 1707.01s |  this PCB to look? So it's going to tell us that we're doing millimeters. We're going to do two
1707.01s - 1712.13s |  layers. This means there's copper on the top and on the bottom. You can actually do tons of layers
1712.13s - 1716.69s |  if you want. And it's going to put those copper layers in the middle. This gets really, really
1716.69s - 1723.09s |  expensive really quick. Most people that I know of just do the top and bottom layers. I know there
1723.09s - 1727.81s |  is some badge makers out there that go crazy and do like eight layers and things. I stick with two.
1728.37s - 1732.85s |  That's just me. So board outline, this is where you can pick if you want it to be a circle,
1732.85s - 1738.13s |  round, rectangle, whatever. I just start out by leaving this as rectangular. I'm going to tinker
1738.13s - 1743.09s |  with it in just a bit and you'll see how I do that. But I leave it as rectangular. And because
1743.09s - 1747.09s |  of that, I leave these the same way too. I'm going to mess around with that board on my own. I don't
1747.09s - 1753.92s |  care what they make. Oops, I think I just clicked cancel on that. So we'll just leave these as
1753.92s - 1762.80s |  defaults for now. So now we have our pink board outline here. Okay, so we're going to go to the
1762.80s - 1770.74s |  document layer real quick. And we're going to click that we want to add an image. Now on the
1770.74s - 1775.22s |  desktop, I've got this Nibbler folder here where I've kind of picked out all of these. So we've got
1775.22s - 1781.92s |  our document layer file that I've kind of preset to this. And there it shows us our little picture
1781.92s - 1786.16s |  of Nibbler. So this is what our badge is going to look like. I'm going to set this to 150 because
1786.16s - 1791.36s |  I've already tested this out and that seems to be a pretty good size for us. So now we have our
1791.36s - 1798.80s |  Nibbler and we put it on here. So we want this board to match that Nibbler. Now, again, there
1798.80s - 1804.32s |  are lots of ways to do this in lots of different editors. This is just how I do it. I have been
1804.32s - 1809.36s |  told this is the absolute caveman method, which it does kind of seem that way. But this is what I do.
1810.16s - 1816.08s |  I just start dragging and dropping. I usually start out by making it pretty extreme like this
1816.08s - 1822.48s |  where it doesn't go very close. Whoops. But you can just drag these things and pull them all the
1822.48s - 1828.80s |  way to where you want them to go. So I'm going to pull them all super gnarly right now just so we
1828.80s - 1837.89s |  can at least see it. But then once we get this kind of close to how we want it, then we can start
1837.89s - 1841.65s |  getting it tighter and tighter. And we'll go over that too, but I'll just try and do this as quickly
1841.65s - 1847.89s |  as I can. Now, one of these is not actually connected and we're about to reach it right now.
1847.89s - 1852.37s |  So this one here is the one to look at because now I've opened it up. If I try and print this,
1852.93s - 1857.89s |  JLCPCB is going to get real mad. So when we do this, we got to make sure that we
1858.69s - 1863.49s |  connect these two properly and zoom in here to make sure they're actually touching.
1866.98s - 1869.86s |  Okay, so let's say that's good enough. We're going to call it good enough for now.
1869.86s - 1876.18s |  Once it is close, that's when I zoom in and start making this really close.
1878.10s - 1884.10s |  So I've had people ask me like, hey, how good do you need to make this? The answer is as good as
1884.10s - 1891.94s |  you want it to be. The tighter you make it and the closer you make it to exactly how your design
1891.94s - 1898.66s |  looks, the better those angles are going to look when you print that PCB. So right there, you can
1898.66s - 1903.70s |  see there's tons of little dots there. And it's really just how extreme do you want to take this?
1903.70s - 1908.10s |  That's really all it is. So let's say that we had that thing all done. We can come over here
1908.10s - 1914.42s |  to view and click 3D view. And now it shows us there is our PCB. Right now they call it blue,
1914.42s - 1918.50s |  apparently. We can make it green, we can make it purple, whatever we want. And we can select the
1918.50s - 1923.22s |  surface finish here too, if we want it to be gold or silver. But for now, this is our PCB.
1924.66s - 1929.38s |  So let's come back here. And now we can say, okay, we want to add another layer. This time
1929.38s - 1934.50s |  we're going to add the top layer. So we come over here and we go to copper.
1935.46s - 1939.78s |  And these are all just files where I took a picture of Nibbler and I put it into GIMP,
1939.78s - 1944.42s |  and I colored in each layer with like, say, green or something like that. Selected everything that
1944.42s - 1947.78s |  was green, chopped out everything else, and just saved to just that one part.
1948.66s - 1952.82s |  Okay, so that's how I made these things. Once we have this, I've already forgotten the name
1952.82s - 1957.94s |  that I selected, or the number. So this one says 62, and I'll show you how I got to that one as
1957.94s - 1962.50s |  well, is when I'm putting these in here, I essentially just guess at first. I say, okay,
1963.46s - 1967.22s |  how about 60? And I put it over here and I say, well, that's a little bit too small.
1968.10s - 1972.02s |  Now, I can place it like that, and I can readjust it over here and just say like,
1972.02s - 1976.90s |  you know, okay, that's pretty close. Let's try 84, and just kind of adjust slowly that way.
1977.46s - 1981.62s |  Or I can just delete that and reenter it as a slightly different size.
1983.06s - 1989.39s |  And this time I'll put in 62, and now it fits.
1990.91s - 1994.35s |  So you really just kind of slowly adjust these things until they look the way you want.
1996.19s - 2002.19s |  Okay, so now, if I was to, I'm going to cancel out of this. Now if I'm to go over here and go
2002.19s - 2008.83s |  to my 3D view, you can kind of vaguely see his little cape there, because that is covered copper.
2008.83s - 2013.15s |  We've added that copper layer, so now they're going to add copper in that spot on just the
2013.15s - 2017.31s |  front. So on the back, there's nothing, but on the front we can see that copper.
2018.51s - 2024.51s |  So let's say we want to expose that copper. So let's come back here, and we do another copper
2024.51s - 2032.35s |  layer. Actually, well, yeah, so you can do it like this, and just make it match the same size.
2034.27s - 2039.47s |  And now we're going to change this from the top layer to the top solder mask layer.
2040.03s - 2046.51s |  Now it becomes subtractive. So if we put this on there, and we go to our 3D view,
2047.15s - 2053.15s |  now we've exposed that copper. So this is how you start designing out how you want that thing to
2053.15s - 2059.74s |  look. Okay, so the next one we're going to do is we come in here, and we go to our FR4 layer. This
2059.74s - 2064.06s |  is the one where we're going to expose all of this as well. So it's still going to be that top silk.
2064.06s - 2069.71s |  Whoops, let me cancel this, so I can actually go to the right thing. So we come over here, and we
2069.71s - 2077.07s |  change this to the top solder mask layer. We come back, we go back to that FR4, and this one says
2077.07s - 2085.87s |  94. So I'm going to set that. Okay, we're going to go ahead and put this right here, and now
2086.83s - 2093.07s |  when we view that again, there he goes. Now he's starting to look a little bit more like Nibbler.
2094.51s - 2100.54s |  So the last one we're going to add is that top silk layer. So now once we add this,
2102.54s - 2110.30s |  oh, I didn't look at the number, 142. And again, each one of these, I just found the numbers ahead
2110.30s - 2113.02s |  of time, because I didn't want to sit there adjusting in front of y'all, and have it be
2113.02s - 2119.98s |  really, really boring. But once we slap that in there, now we've got our Nibbler. Now this
2119.98s - 2126.94s |  document layer, we can come in here, and we can turn that off, and this is what our badge looks
2126.94s - 2134.54s |  like. Now when we go to that 3D view, let's make this black, and now we've got a vague shape of
2134.54s - 2139.58s |  what Nibbler is going to look like. Okay, so now that we have the art, and we're going to call that
2139.58s - 2147.18s |  done, now we can start adding components. So we need that ESP-01S. So we're going to come over
2147.18s - 2161.15s |  here and say place footprint, and we can do ESP-01S. Now once you do this, there's a user
2161.15s - 2166.51s |  contributor section, or user contributed section, and these are things that other people have made
2166.51s - 2172.99s |  and submitted their own footprints that they use. This isn't really that sketchy. I haven't had any
2172.99s - 2178.03s |  of these that were bad yet, but they are all a little different, and some people do make some of
2178.03s - 2183.31s |  these very, very custom, where it's obvious that they were using this in some very unique way that
2183.31s - 2187.87s |  is not how you want to use it. So just be careful to look at these and make sure it makes sense.
2188.83s - 2193.87s |  The better one that I like to use is this one over here, JLCPCB Assembled, because these are
2193.87s - 2198.83s |  the ones that are actually from JLC, and this is where if you change your mind about soldering it
2198.83s - 2204.27s |  yourself, and you say, no, no, I want them to do it, you have to be using these footprints. So make
2204.27s - 2207.87s |  sure that if you're going to have them populate this for you, that these are the ones you're using.
2208.99s - 2213.63s |  Also these tend to be a little higher quality in my opinion. So we're going to choose this one here,
2213.63s - 2218.91s |  and we're going to place it. So it shows it right here. So we're going to pop it down here. We're
2218.91s - 2224.03s |  going to kind of zoom in a little bit. So once we grab this, we can kind of rotate it however we
2224.03s - 2229.71s |  want. You can move it wherever you want. So let's put this right here so it kind of stays
2230.67s - 2235.95s |  in these lines here and makes it look like it's part of our design. So now let's take this and
2235.95s - 2240.27s |  let's put it on the back layer because we don't want this to be showing, which means I got to
2240.27s - 2246.94s |  rearrange it again. Okay, so now if we go to our 3D view, we've got our nibbler just the way we
2246.94s - 2250.14s |  saw them before. You can see those little holes there, but when we turn them around...
2250.14s - 2254.94s |  Oh, I guess this one doesn't do it. Some of them will actually show. There it is.
2255.98s - 2259.66s |  So now we can see, okay, this is how it's going to look. There's our little part,
2259.66s - 2271.34s |  exactly where it's going to be if we put it there. Okay, so now we're going to add a 0.96
2273.42s - 2286.05s |  OLED. Just trying to make sure this is the right part before I actually place it.
2286.93s - 2294.05s |  Yep, that... No, we want the four-pin version. There we go. Okay, so now this screen, we want
2294.05s - 2298.93s |  this to be on the front side. Now if I put it right here, you see it's on that red. That's the
2298.93s - 2303.01s |  copper layer. So we're going to be bridging those pins together. So we got to be careful where we
2303.01s - 2307.81s |  put this to make sure we're not touching any copper. So I'm going to place that over here.
2308.85s - 2318.43s |  We'll go ahead and rotate it a little bit. Nope, don't want to do that. There we go.
2319.55s - 2326.43s |  Let's put it right about there. Okay, so I can't remember for sure what these pins are,
2326.43s - 2330.75s |  but let's say that this pin right here is a ground pin. So we come over here to net,
2331.39s - 2335.79s |  and we can put that we want that to be part of ground. Let's say that this one right here
2336.43s - 2341.47s |  is our 3.3 volt. So on this one, let's say that this one is ground.
2342.43s - 2349.65s |  That next one is 3.3 volt. Okay, now if we turn on RATLINES, you can see,
2350.37s - 2355.09s |  hopefully you can see, there's those blue lines showing me, hey, you haven't connected these yet.
2356.29s - 2362.37s |  So let's go ahead and go over how to connect those. So we're going to start on the back layer
2362.37s - 2366.37s |  here because we've got this red copper here. So we can't go through that with a front layer.
2367.57s - 2372.29s |  So we'll go from the back. And we're going to come over here. And this one right here,
2372.29s - 2378.45s |  this one right here, it says TRACK. So we want to build a track, and it kind of snaps on here.
2378.45s - 2386.77s |  We're going to build a track that comes up, comes over, and then comes down. Now we need one over
2386.77s - 2394.13s |  here. So we're going to come like this, pull that over, and connect it like that. And now
2394.13s - 2400.53s |  our RATLINES are gone because now we've connected all ground nets to all other grounds, and all of
2400.53s - 2407.57s |  our 3-volt nets to all the other ones. Now let's say that this right here was our our data line,
2408.37s - 2414.05s |  and this one here is our data line. And we still want to stay on the back there,
2414.61s - 2420.21s |  but now when we go to connect this, we can't actually make it through here. Because if we do
2420.21s - 2425.81s |  that, we're now connecting those two. They're going to become one net. So how do we get around that?
2427.17s - 2430.53s |  Well, realistically, I should have just started from the front on this. But if we weren't going
2430.53s - 2434.61s |  to go that route, we can stop this right here. We're going to stop it shy of where we're trying
2434.61s - 2440.37s |  to go. And we can come over here to this one here. This one says VIA. And what this is, is this says
2441.01s - 2445.73s |  I want to build a little tiny hole that goes from the front of the board to the back of the board.
2446.61s - 2453.09s |  So now I can go on the red, and I can start at my VIA, and move it over here,
2454.45s - 2460.29s |  and connect it like that. So these VIAs are how you can get around all of the other lines you've
2460.29s - 2464.53s |  built, or the design that you've built. Because now you're able to swap between that front layer
2464.53s - 2476.93s |  and that back layer. All right, I'm trying to think if there was anything else that was major to be
2476.93s - 2485.41s |  showing on this. But so anyway, I guess actually let's look at this real quick. So there is now
2485.41s - 2491.49s |  our badge, as far as that goes. So let's say, okay, let's say this was done. We put on the rest
2491.49s - 2494.85s |  of the components. We were happy with this. We like the way it looks. We like the way the
2494.85s - 2501.89s |  functionality is looking. We want to, we want to print it. So we'd come over here, and we would go
2501.89s - 2508.53s |  to, well first we have to save it. Then we come over here, and say generate Gerber file.
2510.21s - 2514.45s |  When you do this, it's going to ask you if you want to check the DRC. This is your design rule
2514.45s - 2519.97s |  checking. These are the rules where they tell you how close you can put things to each other,
2520.69s - 2527.41s |  and how large you can drill, or how small you can drill. But also things like, are you crossing nets?
2527.41s - 2531.57s |  It's going to check for all of that kind of stuff. So you can say yes, you want to do it.
2532.21s - 2537.65s |  And in our case, we passed. All of our nets are not bridging, and nothing like that. But when you get
2537.65s - 2541.81s |  to that step, there is sometimes when that design rule checking is going to show you something and
2541.81s - 2546.61s |  say, hey this is wrong. You can't do this. But you know that it's what you're trying to do, and you
2546.61s - 2552.21s |  don't care. You can just click that no, and just say YOLO, I want to order it anyway. And they'll let
2552.21s - 2557.73s |  you. So from here, you can select how many you want, and what color you want. But really that's going to
2557.73s - 2563.17s |  be more, it's going to show you that once you get into JLC. Now again, you can order these from
2563.17s - 2568.93s |  anywhere you want. I like using JLCPCB. I've always had good luck with them. They do great work.
2568.93s - 2574.29s |  They have good prices, and they can do the fab for you if you want them to. But you can send them off
2574.29s - 2578.53s |  to anywhere by clicking this generate Gerber button. This one right here is just going to
2578.53s - 2582.45s |  download the files for you, and ask you where you want to put them. And now you can send those out
2582.45s - 2586.53s |  to someone else. You can share them with friends. You can send them to any fab shop, and they'll be
2586.53s - 2592.29s |  able to build those boards for you. Okay, so let's say we had clicked to have JLC do that for us.
2593.17s - 2601.25s |  Let's come back here. We'll go ahead and click go. So this is what it's going to show you in JLCPCB.
2601.33s - 2605.25s |  It also shows you a little picture of your board up there at the top. But this is what you're
2605.25s - 2611.57s |  going to see. There's a lot to go over on here. But the big ones to look at is checking the
2611.57s - 2616.37s |  dimensions to make sure it looks like what you built. Sometimes those can be wildly off, especially
2616.37s - 2621.81s |  if you didn't connect those two board outlines together. PCB quantity, obviously you're going
2621.81s - 2627.73s |  to want to look at that. The next big ones to look at is down a little bit further there,
2627.73s - 2633.25s |  where it says PCB thickness and PCB color. So the thickness is literally just how thick
2633.25s - 2637.81s |  the board is. If you leave that at 1.6, that's your standard badge. That's pretty much what
2637.81s - 2641.81s |  everybody uses. You're really only going to want to adjust that if you're trying to do something
2641.81s - 2645.73s |  special with the PCB, where it needs to be significantly thinner or significantly thicker
2645.73s - 2650.29s |  for whatever reason. But it is going to adjust the cost pretty heavily if you change that.
2651.73s - 2656.45s |  PCB color, obviously that's the color of your actual badge itself that you're creating. And
2656.45s - 2660.61s |  then silkscreen on JLC, they don't usually have any other option other than white,
2660.61s - 2664.29s |  unless you're printing a white PCB, in which case your only option is black.
2664.85s - 2667.73s |  More than likely, you won't need to adjust that because you can't.
2669.01s - 2673.09s |  The next one under that is surface finish. This is what's going to determine the color
2673.09s - 2678.29s |  of that copper layer. If you want to do a black and gold badge, then you need to do that ENIG.
2678.29s - 2684.29s |  That is immersion gold. I can't remember what ENIG actually stands for. But if you want the silver,
2684.29s - 2688.05s |  that's where you're going to go with either the hassle or the lead-free hassle. Either one of
2688.05s - 2693.17s |  those two is going to be that silver color that you see on PCBs. Now the last one that
2693.17s - 2699.49s |  you need to make sure you look at is that remove order number. This one, I don't know why they do
2699.49s - 2705.65s |  not click yes by default, but they do not. The default is no. They're going to print your PCB
2705.65s - 2709.97s |  number directly on it. And the reason for this is that they want you to be able to reorder that
2709.97s - 2714.85s |  exact batch. So later on when they say, you know, would you like to reprint, you know, your previous
2714.85s - 2718.29s |  batch, you can look at the badge and you can say, okay, this is the batch number from the one that
2718.29s - 2723.41s |  I made. Yes, I want that exact one. Realistically, you don't want that, especially because they're
2723.41s - 2727.89s |  going to put it in the worst possible spot. They're going to put it dead center front,
2727.89s - 2734.13s |  center of your badge. Just check that box. It does add, like, I think it's $1.50 to remove
2734.13s - 2738.37s |  the order number from your badge. It's, it's worth it. Just do that one.
2742.00s - 2746.24s |  So that's all I've got for you, but go out there and make some badges.
2746.24s - 2750.88s |  Seriously, it's not that hard. It's a lot of fun. We wouldn't keep doing this year after year after
2750.88s - 2756.48s |  year if it wasn't. So anyway, feel free to reach out to me. If you have any questions whatsoever
2756.48s - 2760.80s |  after this, feel free to come chat with me in the vendor booth. I love meeting new people.
2760.80s - 2764.80s |  Do not hesitate to ask. Hope you guys all have a good DEF CON.
