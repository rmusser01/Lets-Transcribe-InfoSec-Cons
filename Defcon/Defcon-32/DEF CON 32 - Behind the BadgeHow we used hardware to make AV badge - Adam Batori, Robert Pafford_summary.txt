**Introduction to the Project**
- Focus on creating an **ADS-B receiver** on a badge without using expensive SDR chips
- Aim to integrate a Linux system and custom signal processing chain into a low-cost chip

**ADS-B Overview**
- **ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast):** Protocol crucial for aviation safety
- Transmits messages like call signs, flight numbers, and altitudes between airplanes and stations
- Commonly exists over the **MODIS downlink** at **1090 megahertz**

**Hardware Design and Implementation**
- Standard enthusiast receivers use **SDRs** like RTL-SDR
- **SDR chips**: Expensive and power-hungry for badge use
- Alternative method: **Log amp architecture** using RF power level meters and bandpass filters
- Goal: Convert RF signals into a baseband level output

**System on Chip (SoC) and ADC**
- Using **Allwinner T113** as the main Linux component
- **Composite video input** repurposed for ADS-B demodulation
- Reverse engineering to disable video filters and access raw ADC samples

**Challenges and Solutions**
- Reverse engineering undocumented registers for ADC access
- Utilizing **HiFi4 DSP** for signal processing and demodulation
- Overcoming challenges with **USB-C** implementation and **AXP2585 battery management chip**

**Badge Specifications**
- Running **mainline Linux 6.6**
- **Display:** Custom 40x40 circular screen
- Specifications include dual-core A7 processors, 128MB DDR3 RAM, 8GB eMMC storage, GPS, and Wi-Fi

**Development Environment**
- Programming the **HiFi4 DSP** for optimized performance
- Incorporating **FreeRTOS** and using the **Extensa toolchain** for development
- Utilizing **mainline Linux** to facilitate driver integration

**Manufacturing and Testing**
- Overcoming manufacturing challenges, such as soldering issues
- Ensuring a stable system with all components functioning as intended

**Conclusion and Engagement**
- Invitation for questions and further engagement at the Aerospace Village
- Encouragement to share badge experiences and travels on social media
