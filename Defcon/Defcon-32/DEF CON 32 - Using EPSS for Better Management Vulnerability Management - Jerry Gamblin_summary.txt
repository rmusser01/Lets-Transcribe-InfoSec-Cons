**DEF CON 32 Presentation Overview**
- **Speaker**: Jerry Gamblin, vulnerability enthusiast
- **Topic**: Using **EPSS** for Better Vulnerability Management
- **Objective**: Discuss the **EPSS** model and its implementation in **CI/CD** pipelines and traditional systems

**EPSS Model**
- **Definition**: **Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)**
- **Purpose**: Provides data-driven vulnerability management using current threat info from **CVE** and real-world exploits
- **Functionality**: Estimates the likelihood of a **CVE** being exploited within 30 days

**Speaker's Background**
- Runs websites: **CVE.icu** (publishes daily/weekly **CVEs**) and **patchthis.app** (lists network vulnerabilities)
- Member of the **EPSS SIG** and **CVE SIG**
- Experience: 20 years in vulnerability management, formerly with a startup acquired by Cisco

**Vulnerability Management Challenges**
- **Current Situation**: Over 110 **CVEs** published daily
- **Historical Context**: 20 years ago, only 18 **CVEs** daily
- **Need for Machine Learning**: Essential for prioritizing what to patch

**EPSS Implementation**
- **Update Frequency**: Scores updated nightly
- **Integration**: Over 100 vulnerability management tools incorporate EPSS scores
- **Data Format**: CSV with **CVE number**, **EPSS score**, and percentile rank

**Usage Recommendations**
- **Target Networks**: Best suited for network-based attacks
- **Exploitation Focus**: Prioritize patching known exploitable **CVEs**
- **Score Threshold**: Suggested starting point is 0.5 for patching

**EPSS in CI/CD Pipelines**
- **Integration**: Built into major code repositories like **GitLab** and **GitHub**
- **GitHub Actions**: Uses tools like **Trivy** for scanning Docker files and development files

**Community and Development**
- **Open SIG**: Encourages participation, especially from those outside the industry
- **Future Goals**: Develop specific models for healthcare and OT networks

**Challenges and Limitations**
- **CVSS Misuse**: Not intended for determining what to patch
- **Data Complexity**: Integrating **CWE** data is complex
- **Bias in CNA Data**: Potential bias in **CVE** reporting by companies

**Conclusion**
- **Call to Action**: Join the **EPSS SIG** for further involvement
- **Resources**: GitHub repository with 20 years of CVE scripts and data available for free
