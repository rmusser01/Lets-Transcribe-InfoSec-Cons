**Talk Overview**
- **Title**: DEF CON 32 - Hacking Millions of Modems and Investigating Who Hacked My Modem
- **Presenter**: Sam Curry
- **Main Topics**: Personal modem hacking, ISP security vulnerabilities

**Introduction**
- Presentation is divided into two parts: personal modem hacking and hacking ISPs
- Initial discovery of a hacked modem leading to broader research

**Personal Modem Hacking**
- **Discovery**: Unusual IP address replaying traffic led to suspicion of hacking
- **Investigation**: Traced back to a Digital Ocean IP involved in phishing
- **Suspicion**: Modem was likely the weak point for the hack
- **Resolution Attempt**: Returned modem to ISP, losing direct evidence

**ISP Vulnerabilities**
- **Call Center Protocols**: Tech support could manage devices remotely using TR 069 protocol
- **API Discovery**: Exploration of Cox business site APIs revealed potential vulnerabilities
- **API Manipulation**: Accessed and manipulated API endpoints without proper authentication

**Technical Exploration**
- **Reverse Proxy Findings**: Discovered a proxy allowing access to internal APIs
- **Swagger UI**: Found 700 routes in the Swagger file, revealing extensive API capabilities
- **Profile Search Endpoint**: Unauthorized access to customer records, including FBI offices
- **MAC Address Endpoint**: Successfully retrieved and used MAC addresses for device access

**Security Implications**
- **Centralization Risks**: Large ISPs like Comcast centralize data, creating a single point of failure
- **Metadata Concerns**: Increasing storage and monitoring of metadata by ISPs

**Conclusion and Acknowledgments**
- **Collaboration**: Worked with Cox for resolution and acknowledgment of vulnerabilities
- **Future Research**: Encouragement for continued research into similar vulnerabilities
- **Acknowledgments**: Thanks to collaborators and those who assisted with the research

**Audience Engagement**
- **Q&A Session**: Engaged with audience questions about the research and its implications
- **ISP Security Practices**: Discussed the shift towards cloud management of modems and routers

**Final Thoughts**
- **Security in ISPs**: Highlighted the importance of security in centralized ISP systems
- **Encouragement for Research**: Emphasized the need for ongoing exploration of ISP vulnerabilities
