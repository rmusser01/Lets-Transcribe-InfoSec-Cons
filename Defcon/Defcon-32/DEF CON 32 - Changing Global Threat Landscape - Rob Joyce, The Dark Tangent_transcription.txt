9.74s - 14.74s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 who went to sleep last night? Okay, most of you. Good. Um,
21.08s - 24.08s |  hey, so I want to, uh, thank you for coming to one of the first
24.08s - 26.78s |  sessions of the day. Um, there's more of you here than I
26.78s - 30.26s |  expected, um, which is really cool. If you don't remember
30.26s - 33.06s |  anything that happens here, that's okay. We're recording it
33.06s - 37.86s |  and we'll release all that stuff for free later. So I want to
37.86s - 41.32s |  have a fireside chat with Rob Joyce, um, probably most
41.32s - 46.26s |  famously known, um, for memeing the Russians. No, I'm kidding.
46.26s - 49.36s |  Rob has a really long history of a distinguished service for the
49.36s - 52.84s |  United States and, uh, and so I want to first have, he's just
52.84s - 55.14s |  going to talk a little bit about where you're coming from, what
55.14s - 57.94s |  you've done, and then we've got some questions and, and the
57.94s - 60.94s |  concept is we'll have a conversation. Hopefully you'll
60.94s - 64.52s |  learn something and then, uh, depending on how things go, we
64.54s - 69.78s |  might have some Q and A. Sounds like a plan? Ready to do this?
69.78s - 72.58s |  All good, Jeff. Okay, go for it, Rob. Hey, good morning
72.58s - 77.56s |  everybody. So, Rob Joyce, I just retired in March after 34 years
77.56s - 81.02s |  at the National Security Agency. So that was a career where I
81.02s - 86.04s |  came st- thank you. So, wild ride, interesting and exciting.
88.54s - 92.78s |  I started there as a technical engineer, um, worked my way up
92.80s - 97.28s |  to operational things, um, like during the Iraq war, I was the
97.28s - 101.24s |  Iraq issue manager, worked counter-terrorism, back and
101.24s - 105.08s |  forth across NSA where we have two missions. One is signals
105.08s - 109.48s |  intelligence, that's to produce the foreign intelligence against
109.48s - 113.46s |  the adversaries to understand plans, intentions, capabilities,
113.46s - 117.52s |  threats, um, and that's a very traditional intelligence
117.52s - 122.94s |  mission. But we also have a second side where you, you work
122.94s - 127.72s |  to protect the national security systems and those are systems
127.72s - 130.86s |  that carry classified information, war fighting,
130.86s - 133.42s |  command and control, or intelligence. And so those are
133.42s - 136.66s |  the most sensitive networks of the United States government.
136.66s - 141.00s |  And so the, the dual nature of NSA, both playing offense and
141.00s - 144.44s |  defense kind of gives you a unique mindset. It really sets
144.46s - 151.04s |  you up to, to think about, um, you know, how, uh, an offensive
151.04s - 156.04s |  nation state would come at you. And by playing both offense and
156.04s - 159.34s |  defense, you know, the, the old adage of it takes a thief to
159.34s - 162.78s |  catch a thief changes the way you approach both defense and
162.78s - 165.12s |  offense. And I found it fairly fascinating.
165.12s - 168.86s |  And, um, NSA is not known to be the easiest of places to
168.86s - 172.76s |  survive. So just the number of years you served must mean you
172.78s - 176.12s |  have some secret skill to survive in a bureaucratic,
176.12s - 179.38s |  technical, competitive, you know, aggressive kind of
179.38s - 180.56s |  environment.
180.56s - 184.50s |  So I don't know how many of you ever read the book soul of a new
184.50s - 190.80s |  machine. It's a 1980s book about the, the, uh, the PDP 11
190.80s - 194.84s |  designers up in the Boston research triangle. I read that
194.84s - 197.10s |  years ago and there was something in there that stuck
197.10s - 200.04s |  with me where people didn't focus on the next job. You
200.06s - 203.04s |  focused on the one you were in. And if you played a good game,
203.04s - 205.20s |  it was like pinball. You got a free game, you got to play
205.20s - 209.34s |  again. And that was kind of my focus. I enjoyed the jobs I was
209.34s - 214.48s |  in, had multiple careers and jobs across those 34 years. Um,
214.48s - 219.18s |  but it was very much focused on, have a good idea, um, talk
219.18s - 222.58s |  about that idea and bring something to the, to the effort.
222.58s - 224.78s |  And then you get to do new, bigger, better.
224.78s - 228.86s |  And how do you organizationally, so normally in an organization
228.88s - 234.02s |  that's very flat, um, you intern all over the place and you have
234.02s - 237.66s |  an idea of what's going on, but when everything is siloed, how
237.66s - 240.10s |  do you know that you're just, you come up with a great idea.
240.10s - 243.56s |  It wasn't done five years ago, you know, or it's not ongoing
243.56s - 247.50s |  now. So before you can even propose a good idea, you don't
247.50s - 251.14s |  maybe even have the information to, yeah, it inside the fence
251.14s - 254.44s |  line, there's a lot of sharing. So, you know, everybody there
254.44s - 258.24s |  has a clearance doesn't matter if you, um, you know, work the
258.26s - 262.34s |  janitorial staff, the technical staff, the language staff, the
262.34s - 266.00s |  cybersecurity teams, everybody has the same clearance. You may
266.00s - 269.14s |  get some special accesses and some is compartmented, but
269.14s - 272.60s |  overall, you know, it, it, it's important to understand the
272.60s - 275.58s |  greater mission and what, what we're trying to achieve. And so
275.58s - 276.58s |  you do get some opportunities.
276.58s - 279.52s |  Okay. So it's not just everybody in their one area, but oblivious
279.52s - 283.96s |  to what else is, yeah. Um, okay. So then, then you got your, uh,
283.96s - 286.16s |  big assignment, you went to Europe.
286.18s - 290.72s |  Yeah. So I got to represent NSA in the, uh, U.S. embassy in
290.72s - 294.72s |  London. So, um, being the cryptologic representative to the
294.72s - 300.32s |  UK and in that, um, you know, it was awesome until COVID hit. So
300.32s - 304.14s |  when you're a liaison and you're representational, not a lot of
304.14s - 308.00s |  interesting things happen when you're in a total COVID lockdown.
308.00s - 308.20s |  Yeah.
308.70s - 312.08s |  And so did you gain a different appreciation of what, what the
312.08s - 314.28s |  view from the outside is looking back at America?
314.38s - 314.64s |  Yeah.
314.66s - 316.46s |  So our partners or allies or?
316.62s - 319.70s |  I don't care if you're at a company or a government agency, when
319.70s - 324.76s |  you represent yourself to your partners, your customers, um, you,
324.86s - 327.50s |  you understand different things about the way the organization
327.50s - 330.30s |  functions and, and what it looks like from, from the outside.
330.30s - 330.68s |  Definitely.
330.68s - 336.72s |  Yeah. So, um, so then you come back to the States and then you
336.72s - 337.98s |  were in charge of?
338.28s - 340.08s |  The cybersecurity directorate.
340.12s - 342.82s |  So cybersecurity directorate, which is most famous for its
342.82s - 343.46s |  Twitter handle.
344.06s - 350.24s |  Yeah, I did, you know, even, even before going to the UK, I had a
350.24s - 351.64s |  true Twitter presence.
351.72s - 355.12s |  I worked, um, to kind of engage, right.
355.12s - 359.76s |  That's where a lot of the InfoSec timely information is popping out.
360.28s - 362.28s |  And, uh, I built a following.
362.34s - 366.96s |  I had probably more positive and beneficial interactions with that
366.96s - 369.92s |  Twitter handle than the official NSA handles.
369.94s - 373.50s |  So the public affairs chief came to me one day and said, we want to
373.50s - 375.30s |  give you an official NSA handle.
375.94s - 378.70s |  And I told them, hell no, not even know, but hell no.
378.70s - 382.54s |  Cause that means the lawyers get to decide what I can put out there.
382.54s - 385.06s |  I'd have to go through the pre-publication review.
385.34s - 388.98s |  Our public affairs officers would be pushing things at me to push out
388.98s - 392.54s |  there and, and it just wasn't a reasonable idea.
393.06s - 395.50s |  So when they didn't expect me to say no.
396.02s - 398.70s |  So they went away and thought they argued with the lawyers.
398.70s - 402.16s |  They came back with a four page document for me to sign that said,
402.16s - 404.76s |  you can have a official handle.
405.00s - 409.60s |  You don't have to go through pre-pub review, but anything bad that happens
409.60s - 412.40s |  is on you and you know, the nooses around your neck, right?
412.40s - 412.52s |  Right.
412.52s - 416.36s |  Is it a one paragraph and like four pages of rope to hang yourself?
416.40s - 416.88s |  Yes.
416.96s - 420.84s |  And, and I said, I'm already doing that right with my private one.
420.84s - 424.40s |  So, so I agreed, I signed up, I started putting out some things
424.40s - 426.28s |  continued with edgy memes.
426.34s - 429.46s |  Um, you know, Jeff talked about, you know, a couple of times taunting
429.46s - 433.78s |  the Russians, things like that, but it was cybersecurity awareness
433.78s - 437.14s |  month where they came to me with this public affairs idea of all
437.14s - 439.30s |  the boring stuff they were going to talk about in October.
439.66s - 443.82s |  And, um, I, I just couldn't stomach it.
444.26s - 448.66s |  And so, uh, in a little act of defiance, I made a meme, the sweating
448.66s - 452.54s |  guy with the two buttons and it said memes or cybersecurity awareness.
453.00s - 456.80s |  And I, I pushed that out and it got good response and pickup.
456.84s - 458.24s |  And I said, I can do this.
458.24s - 461.36s |  You know, cybersecurity awareness month is 30 days.
461.36s - 465.16s |  I can engage with 30, 31 more, 30 more memes.
465.60s - 471.60s |  Um, I did not understand how hard it is to come up with 30 good ideas
472.24s - 474.20s |  because, you know, I wasn't doing them at work.
474.20s - 478.36s |  I was doing them at home after hours and I'd get home at seven
478.36s - 479.88s |  or eight at night, burnout.
479.96s - 481.44s |  I'd come up with an idea.
481.58s - 482.58s |  I'd make a meme.
482.90s - 486.02s |  I'd get up in the morning and ready to post it at 5 a.m.
486.02s - 490.86s |  before I was going in the skiff and I'd look at it and I'm going, holy crap.
490.86s - 492.78s |  I think that was a good idea last night.
492.78s - 496.20s |  Yeah, I can't put this on an official NSA Twitter account.
496.22s - 498.62s |  And so we'd get something a little more benign.
499.06s - 503.26s |  Um, but I learned that first year it was a lot of work and I had a couple
503.26s - 509.46s |  people who informally helped, but the next year, um, I just kept, uh, a
509.48s - 513.88s |  running log whenever I had an idea and started building up a year's stack.
513.92s - 514.28s |  Yeah.
514.32s - 514.56s |  Yeah.
514.76s - 518.40s |  So I had material banked up and, uh, it went much better last year.
518.72s - 520.68s |  And, uh, so did you pass the torch?
520.84s - 524.64s |  You know, are they going to, is there a meme worthy successor?
524.72s - 527.48s |  Well, Dave Luber is now the CSD director.
527.80s - 531.64s |  He's debating about whether memes are CSD or memes are Rob.
531.96s - 535.96s |  So I will certainly come out with, uh, some memes in October.
535.96s - 538.28s |  We'll see whether NSA, or maybe a head to head.
538.64s - 538.96s |  Yeah.
538.96s - 540.52s |  We could be complimentary.
540.52s - 541.86s |  There's not a competition.
542.26s - 542.42s |  Yeah.
542.42s - 543.50s |  I think that's fantastic.
543.50s - 547.78s |  Um, when I hear that story, I think about the dilemma that we have
547.78s - 549.98s |  sort of in cybersecurity versus hacking.
550.58s - 556.06s |  Um, so in hacking, you get to hack when you feel like hacking, right?
556.06s - 561.78s |  It's when you are, um, opportunistically the stars align and you're inspired
561.78s - 565.58s |  and you hack and it's great, uh, in InfoSec, you have to be professionally
565.62s - 567.18s |  sort of creative all the time.
567.18s - 568.10s |  You're on the clock.
568.56s - 570.00s |  It's your page, you know, paycheck.
570.76s - 574.88s |  And I, I remember the.com days as we came into this era, some people
574.92s - 576.44s |  can't be professionally creative.
576.44s - 577.36s |  That's not who they are.
577.58s - 578.64s |  And other people can.
579.08s - 581.24s |  And I remember reading a story about this.
581.24s - 584.72s |  It was, I'm not the first to ever even think of this Disney animators.
584.72s - 589.48s |  When animation went from a craft to an industry, the same thing
589.48s - 593.32s |  happened, professional illustrators, animators versus not.
593.96s - 594.24s |  Okay.
594.24s - 594.92s |  So let's kick it off.
594.92s - 596.66s |  I've got to, there's a bunch of stuff going on.
596.66s - 599.68s |  I think the first, just most topical thing, top of mind,
599.68s - 600.68s |  cause it's just so recent.
601.00s - 605.84s |  It's it's like hack and leak Trump's complaining that somebody is coming
605.84s - 610.36s |  after him, dumping his emails like this happens every election cycle now.
610.44s - 610.76s |  Yeah.
610.76s - 612.44s |  What what's old is new, right?
612.44s - 615.32s |  And so if you haven't followed, because you're in the DEF CON bubble,
615.68s - 620.04s |  um, they announced, uh, in the last 24 hours that the Trump campaign
620.04s - 624.68s |  was hit with a hack and journalists started receiving material, internal
624.70s - 626.24s |  communications to the campaign.
626.70s - 627.26s |  And.
628.10s - 631.90s |  You know, the assumption is that we are in a cycle again with
631.90s - 634.06s |  hack and leak already starting.
634.14s - 636.58s |  And, you know, there's, there's various opinions and
636.58s - 638.06s |  conjecture about who it is.
638.46s - 641.82s |  Um, you know, being here and not in the know, I, you know, I'm not
641.82s - 645.54s |  going to take, uh, take a guess at that, but you know, the, the
645.54s - 647.62s |  ones we've seen in the past, right.
647.62s - 651.14s |  We've certainly seen the Russians involved in hack and leaks
651.14s - 652.78s |  and focused on our campaigns.
653.04s - 654.60s |  We've also seen the Iranians.
654.60s - 658.42s |  There was a lot of work in the, uh, in the previous election
658.42s - 663.96s |  cycle to pre bunk, meaning to debunk in advance before it came out.
663.96s - 668.36s |  Some Iranian material focused on the campaigns and China has also been
668.36s - 670.16s |  involved in some of the activities.
670.16s - 675.16s |  They've been a little more careful and, and, uh, um, cautious in that space,
675.48s - 680.24s |  but it is very clear and starting this early, it's, um, it's pretty surprising.
680.24s - 680.52s |  Right.
680.78s - 684.46s |  I can't imagine buckle up for October because I think we're in for a wild ride.
684.46s - 684.62s |  Yeah.
684.62s - 684.82s |  Yeah.
684.82s - 687.06s |  The October surprise is coming early.
687.42s - 689.78s |  That you, some, you mentioned pre bunking.
689.78s - 693.86s |  I'm really disappointed that, that, that pre bunking is not terribly effective.
693.86s - 696.54s |  You know, the studies show it doesn't work as well as we'd hoped.
696.82s - 699.70s |  So we're still searching for tools to deal with this
699.70s - 701.52s |  information or dismal information.
701.52s - 702.26s |  It's yeah.
702.34s - 705.60s |  One of the harder challenges is, you know, the Russians used to be
705.60s - 708.18s |  awesome at creating disinformation.
708.56s - 712.88s |  They would create whole storylines that, that would take people down a path.
713.28s - 718.52s |  Now, unfortunately they don't have to, they, their MO today is to pick divisive
718.52s - 724.64s |  issues that have people already pre loaded on both sides and just amplify the stuff
724.64s - 726.52s |  that's naturally coming out of those communities.
726.56s - 728.28s |  They'll just keep loading up both sides.
728.44s - 728.64s |  Yes.
728.64s - 730.02s |  Like they don't have to pick a side.
730.20s - 733.08s |  And so I get frustrated when people tell me like, but why would the
733.08s - 736.84s |  Russians like support though the liberals in France or whatever?
736.94s - 738.94s |  It's like, you know, they, they support everybody.
739.18s - 740.74s |  They just try to get everybody to fight.
741.22s - 741.38s |  Yeah.
741.74s - 744.58s |  Cause they want the perception of chaos or real chaos, right?
744.74s - 748.14s |  They, they introduce it well, but I think don't they, they also come.
749.22s - 750.46s |  There's a boomerang effect, right?
750.46s - 753.62s |  We saw that a little bit with COVID when they started fueling the anti COVID
753.62s - 756.50s |  stuff for the West and then it blows up and now there's an anti COVID movement
756.50s - 760.10s |  in Russia and it's like, it comes back now, I think some of it when they try to
760.10s - 762.02s |  take some of the technical issues, right?
762.32s - 767.56s |  Often it's often it's, um, you know, more domestic and they seem successful with
767.56s - 767.80s |  those.
767.84s - 768.20s |  Yeah.
768.40s - 768.68s |  Yeah.
768.72s - 772.24s |  Well, they must have to have a way of preventing it from coming back at them.
772.84s - 774.64s |  And you can see that in the APTs, right?
774.64s - 777.44s |  If it's a Cyrillic keyboard setting, don't infect.
778.08s - 783.08s |  Um, so I've got to figure out a way to have two keyboards plugged in or add,
783.08s - 784.92s |  maybe just add Cyrillic as a language pack.
784.92s - 785.28s |  You can.
785.40s - 785.68s |  Yeah.
785.68s - 786.48s |  And that does work.
786.68s - 787.20s |  Uh, it works.
787.20s - 789.72s |  And then Chinese and then I should just load them all.
791.40s - 791.76s |  Yeah.
792.68s - 793.04s |  Okay.
793.24s - 798.48s |  So then, um, so the, one of the countries you mentioned China, I mean, they're,
798.60s - 799.80s |  they're having a moment.
799.82s - 802.16s |  They're, um, they're getting pretty aggressive.
802.68s - 802.88s |  Yeah.
802.92s - 808.56s |  Um, you know, not just volt typhoon, but I don't emotionally, it was like, okay,
808.56s - 809.44s |  it's espionage.
809.44s - 812.80s |  You're doing recon, you're stealing secrets, which sucks.
813.68s - 817.88s |  But now it's like, you're preparing the battlefield and that's not so cool.
818.46s - 822.46s |  And so we're pulling their stuff out as fast as we can possibly pull it out.
822.46s - 824.06s |  And it's going in as fast as we can find it.
824.06s - 828.34s |  And it's, it's, it doesn't seem like there's much public awareness about like
828.34s - 832.26s |  how warm, not hot, how warm this effort is.
832.26s - 835.74s |  And, and you've seen it probably much longer and can maybe contextualize
835.74s - 836.62s |  it better for us.
837.06s - 837.30s |  Yeah.
837.30s - 842.22s |  So the, the, the reference Jeff's making is to a camp series of campaigns that
842.22s - 846.38s |  are coming at the U S if you look for volt typhoon in some of the media
846.38s - 851.04s |  references going back, um, as much as two years now where we've been chasing
851.04s - 856.16s |  this, um, hacking activity, mostly living off the land technology where they're
856.16s - 859.84s |  not bringing malware, but they're bringing techniques to gain access to
859.84s - 864.08s |  networks, but it is the networks themselves that they're gaining access
864.08s - 865.72s |  to, which is the differentiator.
866.20s - 871.52s |  There's a set of them that are military related things that we would need to
871.52s - 875.96s |  respond to a crisis in, um, you know, in the Asian hemisphere.
876.44s - 880.84s |  Um, so if China, Taiwan were to kick off, um, you know, what would we have to do?
880.84s - 884.84s |  We'd have to move a lot of troops and material all the way from the
884.84s - 886.88s |  West over into that theater.
887.08s - 890.12s |  We would stage and go through Hawaii and Guam.
890.12s - 894.72s |  And so there's, there's implementation of hacks into critical
894.72s - 896.44s |  infrastructure in Hawaii and Guam.
897.02s - 900.60s |  You can say that's, you know, military preparations, but this
900.60s - 902.40s |  campaign goes farther than that.
902.46s - 906.02s |  It goes all the way back to domestic us where the critical
906.02s - 911.58s |  infrastructures like transportation, aviation, pipelines, electricity
911.94s - 915.46s |  are all being targeted with the same set of living off the land techniques.
915.78s - 919.74s |  And the intent there is not to disrupt the military, but
919.74s - 921.82s |  to create societal panic, right?
921.86s - 925.90s |  There's, there is, there's language for that when you're trying to
925.90s - 928.98s |  induce panic in a society and that's terrorism, right?
928.98s - 934.00s |  This prepositioning literally is with the intent of being able to execute
934.00s - 935.88s |  terrorism against the U S population.
935.88s - 943.52s |  So we've moved, um, far down the rabbit hole in this work where, um, you know,
943.52s - 948.80s |  there's, there's set up for great power competition and preparations for conflict.
949.36s - 955.48s |  It kind of sucks when you're, you're in this kind of a contest and we don't
955.48s - 958.72s |  necessarily ascribe to those kind of rules, right?
958.72s - 960.38s |  We don't really behave that way.
960.42s - 964.06s |  I'm hoping that we're breaking in and stealing all their secrets, but we're
964.06s - 965.82s |  not stealing their corporate secrets.
966.38s - 969.62s |  And it just feels like it's an uneven matchup, right?
969.74s - 970.70s |  It definitely is.
970.70s - 973.78s |  And, you know, that's one of the challenges is, you know, we're a
973.78s - 975.90s |  society, a rule of law society.
976.26s - 979.66s |  So, um, you know, one of the things the military does, we have a cyber
979.66s - 984.02s |  command, but they are bound by the law of armed conflict and that law of
984.02s - 988.50s |  armed conflict says you're not going to create generic pain and suffering
988.50s - 990.24s |  to a civilian population.
990.52s - 994.64s |  So things like a water plant and an aviation, general civilian
994.64s - 1000.12s |  aviation, um, electric grid, those are off limits because of the, the, the
1000.12s - 1002.80s |  broad nature and the unfocused.
1002.96s - 1007.32s |  And it's, it's, I guess China is very much, you know, dual use early days,
1007.32s - 1012.24s |  Russia, you know, single use, but now that the world's dual use, you really
1012.24s - 1017.56s |  have to spend time, I bet de-conflicting like multi-tenant in a structure or
1017.56s - 1019.18s |  building or a network stack, right?
1019.18s - 1021.78s |  How do you, you have to have a whole team that does nothing, but.
1022.54s - 1022.74s |  Yeah.
1022.74s - 1026.26s |  When, when I joined NSA, you know, the world was simple.
1026.26s - 1027.42s |  It was the cold war.
1027.42s - 1034.02s |  It was bipolar tensions, Russia, us, and the Russian things that we cared
1034.02s - 1039.06s |  about were these bespoke military communications, bespoke government
1039.06s - 1044.02s |  devices, and now, you know, the world's on Microsoft windows, the, the world
1044.16s - 1050.40s |  on all of these major us branded, um, infrastructure between switches and
1050.40s - 1052.52s |  routers and firewalls and other things.
1052.92s - 1057.00s |  And so, yeah, it is definitely a dual use, um, world we've entered.
1058.08s - 1060.08s |  So, um, so what do we do?
1060.08s - 1062.64s |  I mean, are the politicians sort of up to speed or are we
1062.64s - 1063.80s |  organized the right way?
1063.80s - 1068.26s |  Do you think, is it, do we need a new revolution or new way of, uh, you
1068.26s - 1072.00s |  know, virtualization, like, what are your thoughts on how do we navigate
1072.10s - 1074.14s |  besides just keep pulling their stuff out?
1074.90s - 1078.14s |  Well, I think one of the big tools in the tool belt is
1078.14s - 1080.26s |  this continuous engagement, right?
1080.26s - 1084.50s |  You'll, you'll hear general Nakasone was here, you know, as former director
1084.50s - 1090.22s |  NSA, he pushed this idea of continuous engagement that, you know, if you, if
1090.22s - 1094.30s |  you think about a soccer field, um, you know, it's not a great strategy if
1094.30s - 1099.10s |  the opposing team gets to shoot unlimited, um, shots on your goal.
1099.44s - 1102.64s |  Um, and you just have to play defense continuously and try
1102.64s - 1103.92s |  to stop each and every kick.
1104.28s - 1108.80s |  The idea that you've got to be out there and, you know, and attacking
1108.80s - 1112.84s |  into, um, the far end of the field and bringing the pressure back to them
1113.08s - 1119.04s |  so that you use multiple tools to go and take away their implants, take
1119.04s - 1123.68s |  away their infrastructure, um, reveal their, their tools and intent, right?
1123.68s - 1125.62s |  That's one of the superpowers of NSA.
1125.96s - 1130.52s |  I mentioned that, you know, the, there's the intent by China to create
1130.52s - 1136.18s |  societal panic, that that intent is not something you find on an
1136.18s - 1138.44s |  incident response activity, right?
1138.46s - 1144.38s |  That's an intelligence policy, um, uh, development where you understand
1144.38s - 1149.48s |  them giving commands, orders, resources to execute this command.
1149.76s - 1152.92s |  And that's where the public private partnership is really important
1152.94s - 1156.90s |  because, you know, the hyperscale cloud providers, the operating system
1156.90s - 1162.06s |  vendors, the, uh, the, the internet backbone, um, providers, they are
1162.06s - 1167.32s |  going to see the activity, um, and they actually are in a better position
1167.32s - 1168.86s |  to do something about it, right?
1168.86s - 1174.58s |  To do that community defense, to clean the pipes, to challenge some of this.
1175.02s - 1181.14s |  But you need the, the connection to that intent and you need the community
1181.14s - 1186.08s |  to come together because no one element in that, in that ecosystem really.
1186.36s - 1186.84s |  I'm curious.
1186.84s - 1189.76s |  How do you, how do you, um, when you were inside, how do you
1189.76s - 1192.80s |  view open source intelligence?
1192.84s - 1196.52s |  There's just an unlimited of different feeds you could spend all of your
1196.52s - 1198.48s |  budget buying different threat feeds.
1199.00s - 1203.80s |  Um, maybe give some people a way of thinking about how to orient to this
1203.92s - 1209.40s |  unlimited amount of potential intelligence and is it useful, you know, what do you.
1209.50s - 1212.14s |  Yeah, it, it's absolutely useful.
1212.22s - 1219.58s |  Um, you know, because it's available and, and, um, you can get it through
1219.58s - 1224.46s |  open source places, that's not where the special sauce of NSA is applied.
1224.82s - 1225.06s |  Right.
1225.06s - 1229.06s |  But there's some point where you've got to bring together the ability to know
1229.06s - 1234.58s |  things that are knowable in the outside with that special intelligence that you
1234.58s - 1237.84s |  can only get from classified techniques.
1237.94s - 1242.82s |  And so, um, you know, we actually started an organization, the
1242.82s - 1247.62s |  cybersecurity collaboration center to bring the classified material out into
1247.62s - 1253.50s |  industry where they could then find more examples of the tradecraft techniques,
1253.50s - 1254.98s |  intrusions, or other things.
1255.42s - 1259.18s |  Um, and they quite frankly are the ones who can do something about it.
1259.46s - 1264.30s |  So, uh, a lot of work to connect in that unclassified space where industry works.
1264.78s - 1265.78s |  Yeah, that's fantastic.
1265.80s - 1270.04s |  Now, is that a widespread bottle or is that kind of unique to the U S or are we
1270.04s - 1273.36s |  sort of taking pages out of other countries playbooks because we're not the
1273.36s - 1277.32s |  only ones under pressure, there's a lot of other countries being targeted as well.
1277.56s - 1282.00s |  And so I, I'm guessing that's almost like this ecosystem of experimentation of like,
1282.00s - 1285.72s |  you know, if I eat garlic, does it keep the Chinese away, you know, instead of
1285.72s - 1290.68s |  the vampire, if I, you know, only route my packets through this, you know, what
1290.68s - 1293.40s |  are people trying is it's, it's gotta be massive experimentation.
1293.50s - 1293.74s |  Yeah.
1293.74s - 1298.26s |  So, so there's a lot of, um, international collaboration, cooperation,
1298.26s - 1303.26s |  cybersecurity is really a cross cutting issue that a lot of people can rally
1303.26s - 1308.22s |  behind, but at the same time, the U S is unique in that, you know, you look at the
1308.22s - 1312.78s |  technologists that gather at places like DEF CON, you look at the power of the
1312.78s - 1317.70s |  Valley, you look at the major hyperscale cloud providers are U S right.
1317.90s - 1322.34s |  So there, there is a responsibility to get the American industry involved
1322.56s - 1325.92s |  because they're global multinational companies and they're the ones who can
1325.92s - 1330.48s |  actually make sea change, but you know, we've got friends and allies, you, you
1330.48s - 1336.68s |  look at the UK has the, um, national cybersecurity center and they, um, have
1336.68s - 1340.32s |  a lot of like-minded ideas and there's things that they innovate and, and flow
1340.32s - 1344.56s |  over here and there's things we do, they copy, you know, Israel is another example
1344.56s - 1350.88s |  of, you know, dense, um, technical capable organization and somebody that's under
1350.90s - 1355.38s |  threat, quite frankly, a lot of the time, um, from their Iranian conflicts.
1355.38s - 1359.62s |  So, um, you know, we learn from them because they're in the tactical
1359.62s - 1361.26s |  knife fight each and every day.
1361.90s - 1366.58s |  There's, um, there's this, I guess, interesting alignment, uh, worrying
1366.58s - 1369.86s |  alignment over the last year or two with, with Russia and China getting
1369.86s - 1371.40s |  closer and closer together.
1371.82s - 1376.34s |  Um, so I'm wondering if you'll, if they'll, do they share these kinds of
1376.34s - 1379.78s |  techniques in your experience or do they, when, when countries get close to each
1379.80s - 1384.04s |  other, they still keep these capabilities separate and they just kind of support
1384.04s - 1385.56s |  each other, but they never merge.
1385.88s - 1392.48s |  Yeah, I, I think, um, you know, there's still, well, there's, there's common
1392.48s - 1394.28s |  reasons for them to get together.
1394.72s - 1396.68s |  Um, they still distrust each other a lot.
1396.92s - 1401.24s |  And so we don't see the kind of collaboration that you do, um, like
1401.24s - 1402.58s |  with the five eyes countries.
1402.68s - 1407.76s |  So you wouldn't see like coming, coming in from, let's say a Russian kind of IOC
1408.26s - 1410.86s |  signature, but really it's on behalf of.
1411.78s - 1412.06s |  Yeah.
1412.62s - 1416.14s |  Don't believe you'd see that unless somebody is adopting tools to do false
1416.14s - 1418.78s |  flags and, you know, change the scent.
1418.90s - 1421.86s |  Because I'm curious, because in China that's, you know, they, they do have
1421.86s - 1424.18s |  their sort of rule of law rule of the party.
1424.62s - 1427.50s |  And in Russia, there's this big connection between the sort of
1427.50s - 1429.06s |  organized crime in the state.
1429.06s - 1432.54s |  I mean, you can't really sometimes tell which is which right.
1432.62s - 1435.82s |  And so those two models aren't really compatible.
1435.82s - 1436.58s |  I don't think.
1436.72s - 1441.08s |  I don't think the, the Chinese leadership would be cool with this, you know, arms
1441.08s - 1444.52s |  distance criminals really running the show.
1444.60s - 1451.96s |  And so it makes me think that, um, ransomware and a lot of these, uh, highly
1452.00s - 1456.88s |  technical, sophisticated, uh, crime operations seem to be mostly coming from
1456.88s - 1458.18s |  Russia, right?
1458.18s - 1459.88s |  They're not really coming from China.
1460.48s - 1460.68s |  Yeah.
1461.36s - 1465.52s |  There, there is a set of China, um, that's active in it.
1465.66s - 1472.58s |  Um, so if any of you saw the ISUN leaks, there was a company called ISUN got
1472.58s - 1474.58s |  hacked and their data was dumped.
1474.94s - 1480.30s |  It was really an interesting kind of case study into the Chinese ecosystem.
1480.74s - 1486.50s |  They have a lot of independent companies who hack on their own, but then market
1486.50s - 1490.54s |  the things that they gather back to the Chinese government so they don't get
1490.54s - 1494.68s |  direct direction, they may get direction to build tools and infrastructure, but
1494.70s - 1497.30s |  then those tools and infrastructure become dual uses.
1497.30s - 1498.30s |  They run their own ops.
1499.02s - 1503.90s |  Um, we don't see kind of the same ecosystem happen in the, in the Russian
1503.90s - 1507.46s |  space where they do leverage the criminal ecosystem.
1507.98s - 1512.74s |  Um, but in both cases, they provide this safe haven.
1513.10s - 1518.98s |  They know the, uh, the, the players, they, um, they enable the players in that
1518.98s - 1523.34s |  they certainly don't constrain them, but they also interact with them in different
1523.34s - 1523.70s |  ways.
1524.00s - 1524.20s |  Yeah.
1524.20s - 1528.56s |  It's curious because you can watch what kind of prosecutions, uh, or news
1528.56s - 1530.52s |  coverages are happening in Russia or China.
1530.52s - 1534.08s |  And you can see in the States, you'll see prosecutions from computer crime all
1534.08s - 1534.62s |  the time.
1535.28s - 1538.82s |  Um, and maybe it's just not reported the same way there, but it just, it definitely
1538.82s - 1542.42s |  seems like the types of crimes that are getting reported or, or publicly talked
1542.42s - 1546.96s |  about are quite different, which makes you think that either they don't care or
1546.96s - 1551.24s |  they're using it, you know, for recruitment or training or something's going on.
1551.24s - 1551.84s |  That's different.
1552.44s - 1552.72s |  Yeah.
1552.86s - 1559.14s |  Um, then those nation States do treat their hacker element as, you know, uh, a
1559.14s - 1564.26s |  national asset and they use them differently, but there's the spectrum that
1564.26s - 1567.38s |  goes from the very official nation state.
1567.46s - 1572.66s |  You know, you work for the military, the Intel service, some special branch of the
1572.66s - 1578.82s |  government to do intelligence operations or cyber operations in advance all the
1578.82s - 1583.68s |  way down through this quasi, I know and understand it's going on.
1584.04s - 1589.16s |  I either task it or I just accept the benefits of it all the way down to, um,
1589.20s - 1590.04s |  last couple of years.
1590.04s - 1594.78s |  The interesting one is, um, some of the hacktivist space where you get inspired
1594.78s - 1599.40s |  by a national requirement and take action.
1599.78s - 1604.02s |  I'm thinking, you know, the, the Russian hackers to Ukraine, the Ukrainian hackers
1604.02s - 1608.68s |  to Russia, um, some of the Israel, um, Hamas, Palestine.
1608.80s - 1613.80s |  Yeah, this is, is this, it seems to me to be pretty unique that a country would
1613.80s - 1618.96s |  basically turn to the public and say, okay, hack on our behalf, go get them.
1619.32s - 1622.36s |  And, and I'm going to tell an NSA story cause it's unclassified.
1622.80s - 1628.60s |  Um, years ago there was this, uh, uh, a meeting with the industry and folks
1629.46s - 1634.26s |  that NSA was hosting and part of it was sort of the, uh, I think it was called
1634.26s - 1637.02s |  like cyber red Dawn was sort of the theme.
1637.42s - 1643.42s |  And the idea was, is there, they were exploring the concept, could there ever
1643.42s - 1644.78s |  be a sort of cyber red Dawn?
1644.78s - 1646.70s |  And if so, what would we do about it?
1647.26s - 1654.74s |  And, um, and my, my observation was, well, if there is a cyber red Dawn and we're
1654.74s - 1659.00s |  under attack, all the Microsoft employees are not going to go run to the hills and
1659.00s - 1659.76s |  take up guns.
1659.92s - 1662.36s |  They're going to run to Microsoft to defend the networks, right?
1662.36s - 1665.44s |  The people that understand their networks are going to defend their networks.
1665.88s - 1669.32s |  And then is the president going to get on television and say like network
1669.32s - 1675.20s |  operators that know iOS 3.2 0.5, uh, point to these IP address ranges, go, you
1675.20s - 1679.72s |  know, these people that understand Nokia go, how would that work?
1679.72s - 1684.08s |  And what's, you know, um, so I really lauded them for the, the, the thinking
1684.08s - 1688.98s |  of it, but, you know, in, in the end, I'm so curious on, like, they're just going to
1688.98s - 1689.98s |  create noise, right?
1689.98s - 1695.66s |  How do you, unless it's a big public campaign just to embarrass them, like,
1695.66s - 1697.10s |  look, I got into a radio station.
1697.26s - 1700.30s |  I don't see them actually having an effect, right.
1700.30s - 1702.18s |  Beyond a public relations effect.
1702.22s - 1702.54s |  Yeah.
1702.54s - 1706.34s |  So, you know, in, in our world, again, I go back to that country.
1706.34s - 1707.62s |  We're a rule of law.
1708.00s - 1714.16s |  You're not going to see the U S, um, you know, tasking people to independently
1714.60s - 1717.52s |  take up arms, cyber arms for the government, right?
1717.52s - 1721.28s |  The, the idea of letters of mark and reprisal, all of those things.
1721.64s - 1728.14s |  When I led tailored access operations, which was the hackers of NSA, we literally
1728.14s - 1732.92s |  only used NSA civilians on keyboard in military, um, on keyboard.
1733.32s - 1735.04s |  We would not use contractors.
1735.06s - 1740.14s |  There's different organizations have different rules, but that nation state
1740.14s - 1746.98s |  intrusion into another nation sensitive network is so risky that you've got to
1746.98s - 1748.36s |  own that, right?
1748.36s - 1755.46s |  If it goes bad, literally you could see a state department official, the state
1755.46s - 1757.10s |  department getting demarched.
1757.10s - 1761.74s |  You could see a white house press secretary or a senior official having to
1761.74s - 1764.78s |  address the fallout consequences of a hack gone bad.
1765.22s - 1770.62s |  And so if I'm controlling it at that level inside our operations, we're
1770.62s - 1774.54s |  certainly not going to ask people to go up and take up cyber arms on our behalf.
1774.94s - 1779.82s |  But the interesting space in this hacktivist motivational thing is we are
1779.82s - 1786.14s |  also seeing Intel services kind of take official government action, but cloak
1786.14s - 1791.30s |  themselves and create disinformation that it's being done by activists to kind of
1791.30s - 1796.08s |  create the fog of war and shed the, shed the attribution a little bit from
1796.08s - 1797.56s |  nation state capabilities.
1798.48s - 1801.80s |  Do you ever see, um, in the hacktivist, do you see the useful idiots being
1801.80s - 1802.72s |  employed a lot?
1803.72s - 1804.36s |  Absolutely.
1804.36s - 1810.08s |  It, it ranges from that, you know, useful idiot through tasking to no, we'll do it
1810.08s - 1811.60s |  and pretend to be an activist group.
1811.84s - 1812.32s |  Oh man.
1812.48s - 1817.96s |  So, um, there's another group that, um, it's much smaller, uh, the super
1818.02s - 1823.02s |  empowered individual and the super powered individual really kind of came to
1823.02s - 1828.10s |  light at the beginning, um, of the Ukraine, the invasion of, by Russia of
1828.10s - 1833.90s |  Ukraine, where the community got really distraught and wanted to get involved.
1833.90s - 1837.58s |  They wanted to do something right, but not necessarily a call to arms, go attack
1837.82s - 1838.30s |  Russia.
1838.30s - 1842.86s |  It was much more like, oh no, what can I do in my position where I'm sitting?
1843.18s - 1845.42s |  And you saw all kinds of community responses.
1845.44s - 1849.92s |  Um, I think the Mongo DB community said, you know, we've got this community
1849.92s - 1854.20s |  platform, but we're just, we just, let's have the, the Russian projects move away.
1854.20s - 1854.48s |  Right.
1854.48s - 1856.28s |  You have a year to move away your projects.
1856.28s - 1857.44s |  We just, we don't want them here.
1858.16s - 1863.76s |  Um, you saw different companies responding to, uh, sanctions that were coming.
1864.88s - 1872.40s |  So if you were, I don't know, Eugene Kaspersky in a super empowered individual,
1872.40s - 1875.00s |  he could order softer updates, right?
1875.00s - 1879.42s |  If he has had a bad day and wants to order an update to delete everybody's
1879.86s - 1882.34s |  data, he could write same thing.
1882.34s - 1886.70s |  Elon Musk, if he wants to turn down off Starlink, cause he's having a bad day
1886.70s - 1891.18s |  online, he's super empowered to wreck the U S foreign policy, right?
1891.18s - 1892.82s |  This, this is fairly new.
1893.30s - 1895.70s |  It's not a giant board of a corporation.
1895.70s - 1896.78s |  It's not Boeing.
1897.30s - 1899.46s |  It's one guy or gal.
1900.26s - 1902.98s |  So how do you even deal with that?
1903.72s - 1909.60s |  Yeah, I, I think we've got to look at the resiliency of our networks and, and the,
1909.96s - 1912.32s |  the system of systems we've created, right?
1912.68s - 1918.24s |  I think CrowdStrike was a wake up call that, you know, it was not a decision
1918.24s - 1923.16s |  made, but an accident that then had massive repercussions, right?
1923.16s - 1927.12s |  So, you know, that all the people who are looking at creating mischief on the
1927.12s - 1929.28s |  internet are now studying that.
1929.28s - 1930.56s |  What are those choke points?
1930.58s - 1937.46s |  What are those ways in that if I cause pain at that point amplifies and magnifies
1937.46s - 1939.18s |  the effect I can have throughout.
1939.62s - 1943.94s |  And so that's, that's a place a super empowered individual could do something,
1944.22s - 1950.34s |  but it's also a place where the, the, the pressure of a hack or even the accident
1950.74s - 1952.94s |  could, uh, could ripple through our systems.
1953.38s - 1955.22s |  Well, and it also could work in reverse.
1955.22s - 1958.98s |  I mean, I remember this is years ago, but there's this guy, Larry, who ran
1959.00s - 1964.48s |  SpamHouse and it's like, well, if you anger Larry, I mean, this is an example,
1964.48s - 1968.52s |  but if you angle angry Larry and he puts you in this black hole list, you just
1968.52s - 1969.20s |  don't get email.
1970.32s - 1972.08s |  So, you know, don't piss off Larry.
1972.64s - 1980.08s |  Um, so with these super empowered individuals, I think there's a, um,
1980.36s - 1984.32s |  there's another element coming in, which is like either personal responsibility
1984.38s - 1989.18s |  or liability, and we're starting to see sanctions, right?
1989.22s - 1994.46s |  Uh, enter the field as a new tool, new option in a sort of a diplomatic tool belt.
1994.90s - 1999.30s |  And, um, the example I always bring up is, uh, there's a skirmish on the
1999.30s - 2001.98s |  border between China and India.
2002.50s - 2004.98s |  There's loss of life on both sides.
2005.30s - 2010.86s |  India is really upset, but instead of engaging in more armed conflict, they
2010.86s - 2012.66s |  go and ban Tik Tok from their app store.
2013.64s - 2017.60s |  And, uh, and Tik Tok says, Oh no, that's $6 billion in revenue.
2017.60s - 2018.24s |  We're doomed.
2019.16s - 2020.88s |  And China says, we'll retaliate.
2021.12s - 2021.96s |  We'll ban.
2023.00s - 2026.80s |  Oh, there's no Indian apps because we don't allow them in the app store in China.
2027.48s - 2028.76s |  It's asymmetric, right?
2028.76s - 2030.68s |  They, they didn't have a method to respond.
2030.68s - 2034.52s |  And so I think now there's also a new tools emerging in the toolbox
2034.52s - 2036.36s |  that didn't exist a few years ago.
2036.78s - 2041.20s |  Are those, how do you, do you ever get involved in the discussions about no,
2041.22s - 2042.46s |  no, select this tool.
2042.70s - 2042.98s |  Okay.
2042.98s - 2043.18s |  Yeah.
2043.18s - 2045.26s |  We'll hack it if you want us to, but you should maybe really
2045.26s - 2046.70s |  try this other option first.
2046.74s - 2051.78s |  Yeah, no, uh, my first response in a lot of the policy discussions, right.
2051.78s - 2055.24s |  When, when I was at the white house or when we're talking to the white house
2055.24s - 2060.30s |  in, in operational space is usually the best response to a hack is
2060.30s - 2061.86s |  not to hack straight back.
2062.10s - 2062.42s |  Right.
2062.42s - 2065.86s |  The, the answer of I'll bring a bigger cyber stick to somebody
2066.18s - 2067.96s |  is usually not the answer.
2068.34s - 2074.62s |  Um, the U S has a whole quiver of different tools and it ranges from
2074.70s - 2080.30s |  sanctions to financials, um, to name and shame, to diplomatic pressures,
2080.30s - 2083.68s |  to indictments, to all of these other things.
2083.70s - 2088.78s |  And, you know, it, it, it needs to be this tapestry of a solution.
2089.20s - 2093.86s |  Um, there is no one thing that is going to make, um, you know, the
2093.86s - 2098.00s |  Chinese PLA say, Ooh, you know, that was too hard.
2098.00s - 2105.78s |  I'm going to stop and, and just, uh, make my, my, my hacking entities go away.
2105.78s - 2107.44s |  We're done with hacking forever.
2107.78s - 2108.06s |  Right.
2108.06s - 2112.04s |  So you've got to get to the point where you add that friction, the
2112.04s - 2115.26s |  continuous engagement, so they can't be as successful all the time.
2115.78s - 2119.74s |  But you also want to do some things to think about the decision makers, right.
2120.38s - 2124.42s |  Everybody in those official structures has a boss all the way
2124.42s - 2125.74s |  up to the leader of the country.
2126.22s - 2130.06s |  And if their hacking operations are bringing pain to the people who are
2130.06s - 2135.54s |  their bosses, whether it's, Hey, I gave you, you know, this massive pile
2135.54s - 2141.14s |  of money and you failed, or I gave you the authority to do this hack and
2141.14s - 2143.04s |  you got caught and embarrassed me.
2143.04s - 2148.38s |  And now, you know, our ambassador is responding to a Dimarsh or, you
2148.38s - 2152.86s |  know, we've been called out for this global campaign of hacking critical
2152.86s - 2158.70s |  infrastructure and, and, you know, it is, it is disparaging us in the world's
2158.70s - 2163.46s |  eyes and causing us, you know, uh, reputational problems, those things
2163.46s - 2168.46s |  stack up to where the authorities constrict, the money constricts the,
2168.50s - 2174.18s |  the chain of command, um, is much more involved and adds bureaucracy into that
2174.18s - 2177.94s |  space, you want to add the friction, but in the end, you've got to get to
2177.94s - 2179.78s |  human beings who make decisions.
2180.02s - 2183.74s |  And there's a lot of tools for those human beings, um, to stop.
2184.54s - 2185.98s |  So, um, I want to go back.
2185.98s - 2189.58s |  We were talking about, uh, a mutual friend, Tony Sager.
2189.82s - 2194.86s |  Um, and I use this quote, Tony said, I don't know how many decades ago, but
2194.86s - 2200.82s |  he said that, um, you can't, you can't defeat your opponent one-on-one because
2200.82s - 2204.78s |  there's just the population disparity between, um, different countries.
2205.10s - 2206.30s |  So you have to automate.
2206.78s - 2210.34s |  And so we try to automate as much of everything we can.
2210.34s - 2213.30s |  We, we look at everything, we create automation, we try to automate everything
2213.30s - 2218.54s |  we could possibly automate, and then we try to automate the rest because
2218.54s - 2220.02s |  there's just not enough humans.
2220.34s - 2221.46s |  And that was a long time ago.
2221.86s - 2224.30s |  Tell us, tell me about your, your thoughts around automation, automated
2224.30s - 2226.98s |  defense, like how do you free up your operators?
2227.22s - 2231.26s |  Like, what do you think the highest useful purpose of a human is in this
2231.30s - 2235.62s |  chain and how much of it can be automated away to let them focus on that truly
2235.62s - 2237.26s |  human aspect?
2237.26s - 2238.90s |  Is it the risk reward?
2238.90s - 2241.38s |  Like you need a human to make this decision or?
2242.06s - 2242.34s |  Yeah.
2242.38s - 2245.38s |  What I've found is the, the humans are the creative element.
2245.58s - 2249.94s |  They're going to find the new and novel thing that slips through the cracks.
2250.38s - 2256.06s |  And whether it's the, the, the criminals innovating or whether it is the, um, the,
2256.06s - 2260.78s |  the, the defenders innovating, it's going to be the case where, you know, that
2260.78s - 2263.66s |  innovation is going to move the needle and change things.
2263.66s - 2269.90s |  But I do think we are at, um, we're at an inflection point right now where, um,
2270.06s - 2274.74s |  you know, generative AI, large-scale machine learning, um, is just going to
2274.74s - 2276.66s |  increase the pace and speed.
2277.22s - 2281.78s |  As you've looked over the last several years, the time from knowledge of a
2281.78s - 2287.30s |  vulnerability and a POC hitting the internet to the amount of exploitation
2287.30s - 2289.78s |  has just shrunk and shrunk and shrunk.
2290.26s - 2296.02s |  And, you know, I also think we talked early about the Chinese living off the
2296.02s - 2298.54s |  land campaign in Volt Typhoon.
2298.94s - 2304.78s |  Um, we're going to need machine learning to baseline what is normal and find the
2304.78s - 2310.14s |  anomalous things because of the stealth and quietness of those activities.
2310.50s - 2316.58s |  So, um, you know, I believe that the automation is going to start to address
2316.94s - 2322.74s |  the machine speed attacks and we're both going to see the, the ratcheting on
2322.74s - 2327.62s |  either side, um, moving towards speed and scale needing that automation.
2328.98s - 2329.34s |  Okay.
2329.34s - 2333.06s |  So we've got, um, if I'm reading this right, well, we have 11 minutes left.
2333.06s - 2333.66s |  Is that correct?
2333.66s - 2334.14s |  Everyone?
2335.22s - 2335.66s |  Five.
2335.66s - 2337.58s |  Oh, well then let's take one question.
2343.14s - 2343.38s |  Yep.
2343.38s - 2344.66s |  You got to get closer to the microphone.
2398.33s - 2399.65s |  Do you want to kind of repeat the question?
2400.17s - 2405.65s |  So, so I'll, I'll summarize a bit of what I heard, which is, Hey, there's a lot of
2405.65s - 2410.13s |  different organizations in the U S that are part of the puzzle for cybersecurity.
2410.53s - 2417.57s |  And, you know, whether it's DHS, CISA, FBI, NSA, um, DOD, you know, where are the
2417.57s - 2422.61s |  lanes, who's the orchestrator and, you know, how does the change in the political
2422.61s - 2426.01s |  environment, especially, you know, if we have a new administration change all of
2426.01s - 2428.49s |  that, so we have been getting better.
2428.49s - 2432.17s |  I won't say it's perfectly solved and all the gears are in, in complete
2432.17s - 2436.37s |  synchronicity, but you know, there's strengths and weaknesses in each of the
2436.37s - 2440.25s |  agencies and we're starting to get a rhythm where we know how to play to those
2440.25s - 2440.89s |  strengths.
2440.97s - 2446.53s |  Um, and you'll see things like campaigns where we have multiple agencies involved
2446.53s - 2451.61s |  in that, you know, FBI doing domestic stuff with their legal authority with DOJ,
2451.97s - 2458.37s |  um, combined with cyber command doing some extra outside the U S activity to do
2458.37s - 2463.49s |  takedowns in conjunction with FBI doing the internal U S CISA working with
2463.49s - 2468.09s |  industry and doing that campaign to synchronize the things that are across,
2468.17s - 2473.77s |  uh, the, the, the civilian infrastructure and then NSA lending technical expertise
2473.77s - 2476.45s |  and foreign intelligence, um, into that mix.
2476.45s - 2480.53s |  And, and we're getting better and learning over time on how we do those.
2481.01s - 2486.25s |  Um, the, the national cyber director was created to kind of be that band
2486.29s - 2488.05s |  conductor across all of them.
2488.45s - 2495.17s |  And so, um, you know, we've got that, that, that apex, um, in reality, you know,
2495.21s - 2500.13s |  a lot of the, the activity today, um, is ground up.
2500.49s - 2506.49s |  And, and when I say that, I mean, one agency has either a special, um, insight,
2506.49s - 2510.57s |  a special relationship, a team that's been working, and then they start to bring
2510.57s - 2514.81s |  the players in that can collaborate and add to that mix.
2515.17s - 2521.65s |  And then, you know, the, the, the, uh, ONCD and others then do the convening
2521.65s - 2526.45s |  to bring us all around the execution and synchronization, um, that, that,
2526.45s - 2533.73s |  because the roles are enshrined in statue and law and policy, um, you know,
2533.73s - 2535.81s |  we'll continue throughout administrations.
2535.81s - 2541.53s |  The nice thing about, um, cybersecurity, it's something that's fairly bipartisan.
2541.93s - 2547.13s |  Um, everybody can get behind the need to stop foreign adversaries into our spaces.
2547.45s - 2553.57s |  So, um, I, I am, uh, optimistic that the trajectory continues the biggest
2553.57s - 2557.77s |  shortcoming, and I heard an ask about the shortcoming I see today is, you know,
2557.77s - 2563.21s |  the scope and scale of the threats against the resources and, you know, the
2563.21s - 2567.97s |  innovation that comes, um, from the attackers into the vulnerability space.
2568.33s - 2573.65s |  And you see a lot of effort into, we've got to get to the point where we do the
2573.65s - 2576.49s |  things we know matter, right?
2576.49s - 2578.85s |  We've got to get on two factor authentication.
2578.85s - 2583.01s |  We've got to get companies, um, building more secure software.
2583.01s - 2587.81s |  We've got to get out of some of the memory unsafe languages and get the core
2587.81s - 2593.01s |  technologies over into things that, uh, that are defendable and defensible.
2593.33s - 2597.65s |  And then, um, you know, we've got to, we've got to build the staffs and teams.
2597.65s - 2602.77s |  And I think Jeff, to your question about automation, you know, the, the scope and
2602.77s - 2608.53s |  scale is so hard on some of these threats and, you know, having a big enough team to
2608.53s - 2613.77s |  defend 24 seven and who wants to work that graveyard shift in the middle of the night
2613.77s - 2617.37s |  on a holiday, you know, automation helps take the pressure off some of that.
2617.37s - 2619.65s |  So I like the trajectory we're on.
2619.69s - 2620.77s |  It is a journey though.
2620.77s - 2624.29s |  It is a long journey and we're just, um, we're, we're on the path.
2625.33s - 2625.65s |  All right.
2625.65s - 2626.25s |  Thank you, Rob.
2626.25s - 2627.45s |  Thank you for your service.
2627.57s - 2631.21s |  Thank you everyone for being here and we'll see you around the con.
2631.77s - 2632.21s |  Appreciate it.
2632.25s - 2632.65s |  Thanks.
