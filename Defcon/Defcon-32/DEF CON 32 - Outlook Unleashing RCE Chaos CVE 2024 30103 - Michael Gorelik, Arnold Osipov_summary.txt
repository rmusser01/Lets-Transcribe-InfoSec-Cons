**Introduction to the Vulnerability**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Opening an email in Outlook can trigger RCE through invisible forms.
- **COM Objects:** Forms in Outlook are COM objects, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
- **CVE-2024-21378:** Opens gate to Outlook RCE chaos.
  
**New Vulnerabilities and Discoveries**

- **CVE-2024-30103:** New RCE vulnerabilities discovered in Outlook.
- **NTLM Leaks:** Other vulnerabilities can cause NTLM leaks from domain-joined devices.
- **Form Injection:** Vulnerabilities in form injection can lead to RCE.

**Understanding Forms in Outlook**

- **Synchronization of Forms:** Forms synchronize across clients via Exchange server.
- **Custom Forms:** Can be created by modifying existing forms or programmatically.
- **CFG Files:** Configuration files define properties of forms such as messages or appointments.

**Exploiting the Vulnerability**

- **Matching Algorithm:** Vulnerability discovered due to failure in exact word matching algorithm.
- **Backslash Exploit:** Adding a backslash bypasses the matching algorithm, allowing form execution.
- **Registry Manipulation:** Involving class IDs and paths for form registration.

**Patch Analysis and Bypass**

- **Patch by Microsoft:** Removed relative paths to solve vulnerabilities.
- **Backslash Misuse:** Additional control flows found by manipulating backslashes.
- **Partial Fixes:** Microsoft patched some vulnerabilities but left others open for exploration.

**Monikers and Compound Monikers**

- **Moniker Use:** Used in Office applications to identify COM objects.
- **Exploiting Monikers:** Adding characters like exclamation marks or square brackets turns hyperlinks into composite monikers, enabling RCE.
- **Unsafe API:** MK parse display name is unsafe and can lead to RCE.

**NTLM Credential Leaks**

- **Email Links:** Clicking links in emails can leak NTLM credentials.
- **Zero Click Exploits:** NTLM leaks can occur without user interaction.
- **Compound Monikers:** Lead to NTLM leaks and RCE.

**Recommendations and Conclusions**

- **Security Recommendations:** Enforce Kerberos, enable SMB signing, manage outbound SMB.
- **Patch Outlook:** Regularly update Outlook to protect against vulnerabilities.
- **Microsoftâ€™s Patch Approach:** Focuses on specific code flows but may not address all vulnerabilities.

**Credits and Acknowledgments**

- **Net Spy Group:** Significant contributions to discovering new vulnerabilities.
- **Checkpoint Research:** Found vulnerabilities in Outlook regarding monikers.
- **Etienne Stevens:** Provided tools and research relevant to vulnerabilities discussed.
