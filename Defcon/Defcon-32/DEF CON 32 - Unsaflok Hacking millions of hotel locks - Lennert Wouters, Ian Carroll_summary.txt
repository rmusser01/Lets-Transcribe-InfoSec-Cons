**Introduction to Hotel Lock Vulnerabilities**
- **Electronic hotel locks**: In use for over three decades, integral to hospitality sector
- **Vulnerabilities discovered**: Affecting three million **dormakaba Saflok locks**

**Saflok System and Vulnerabilities**
- **Proprietary key derivation function**: Used for MIFARE Classic cards
- **Proprietary encryption algorithm**: For card contents
- **Reverse engineering**: Allowed forging of valid keycards
- **Deactivation of deadbolt**: Possible with forged keycards

**Disclosure and Mitigation**
- **Reported vulnerabilities**: To dormakaba in September 2022
- **Responsible disclosure and mitigation**: Part of the presentation
- **Checking for patches**: To ensure personal safety

**Previous Research and Related Work**
- **Onity locks (2012)**: Cody Brocious, exploited external programming port
- **Vingcard locks (2018)**: Tomi Tuominen and Timo Hirvonen, master key creation

**Saflok System Architecture**
- **Offline locks**: Front desk server writes key card with door access
- **Semi-online architecture**: Some large hotels use Zigbee coordinators for audit logs

**Reverse Engineering Process**
- **System 6000 software**: Required for hotel setup
- **RFID encoder and MIFARE Classic 1k cards**: Needed for research
- **Database access**: Allows reading of card data

**Key Derivation and Encryption Details**
- **MIFARE Classic card structure**: 16 sectors, 4 blocks each
- **Sector 0 key derivation**: From UID, not secure
- **Sector 1 key**: Same across deployments, identifies Saflok system
- **Key derivation function (KDF)**: Reverse engineered, now publicly available

**Attack Process**
- **Re-sequencing card creation**: For privileged access levels
- **Property ID acquisition**: Essential for card creation
- **Full attack**: Use of re-sequencing and opening keycards

**Remediation and Security Enhancements**
- **New enhanced security mode**: AES encryption and MyFair Ultralight C
- **Encoder replacements**: With secure elements
- **Integration challenges**: Delayed upgrades, especially in large properties

**Hotel Card Statistics**
- **Card cost awareness**: Significant expenses for hotels
- **Switch to ultralight C**: Driven by reduced costs

**Identifying Vulnerable Systems**
- **Encoder and lock identification**: Visual cues at hotel check-in
- **Card type detection**: Using RFID tools

**Personal Safety Recommendations**
- **Supplemental security**: Door bolt straps, under-door wedges
- **General awareness**: Potential for future vulnerabilities

**Conclusion and Summary**
- **Vulnerability highlights**: Open any door with a single card
- **Historical context**: System vulnerability since 1988
- **Positive collaboration**: With dormakaba for remediation efforts

**Demonstrations and Audience Interactions**
- **Proof-of-concept demos**: Using Proxmark 3 and Flipper Zero
- **Audience questions**: Addressed disclosure process, technical specifics, and system updates
