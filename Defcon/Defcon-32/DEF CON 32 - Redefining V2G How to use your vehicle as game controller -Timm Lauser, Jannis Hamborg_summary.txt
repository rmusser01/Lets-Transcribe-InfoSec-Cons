**Introduction to DEF CON Talk**
- First-time presenters at DEF CON
- Talk titled: **Redefining V2G: How to use your vehicle as a game controller**
- Focus: Using cars as game controllers

**Presenters' Backgrounds**
- **Tim**: PhD student, Darmstadt University, focuses on automotive security and theoretical analysis
- **Janis**: PhD student, ACSD, focuses on resilience in automotive and IoT systems

**Research Group and Project Motivation**
- Research group focuses on teaching and automotive security
- Created V2G project to motivate students in automotive research
- Use of a Volkswagen ID.3 as a research car

**Automotive Security and Attack Vectors**
- **Long-range attacks**: Cellular communication, V2X communication
- **Short-range attacks**: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi connections
- **Physical attacks**: Access to car's bus systems (CAN bus)

**Research Cars and Equipment**
- Focus on electric vehicles: Volkswagen ID.3 and Tesla Model 3
- Equipped with vector boxes and LEM sensors for data collection
- Goal: Correlate physical measurements with CAN bus data

**Understanding and Accessing the CAN Bus**
- **CAN bus**: Developed by Bosch, dual wire twisted pair cable
- Multi-master protocol, ECUs share information
- Access through repair manuals, wiring diagrams, or contactless CAN readers

**Software and Tools for CAN Bus**
- Use of **CANutils**, **PythonCAN**, and **SavvyCAN** for CAN bus data
- **Linux CAN driver** and **CANup command** for accessing data
- Focus on reverse engineering CAN messages

**V2G Project Setup**
- Development of Raspberry Pi-based system to emulate Xbox 360 controller
- Connection via OBD2 port and Bluetooth to a laptop
- Use of **UDS protocol** for data transfer

**Hardware and Software Architecture**
- Raspberry Pi Zero, CAN head, and custom PCB for OBD2 connection
- Software includes install scripts, Bluetooth emulation, and vehicle-specific configurations

**Gaming Experience and Demonstration**
- Setup includes a large monitor and immersive game experience
- Demonstration with games like Need for Speed and SuperTux Kart
- Mapping car controls to game functions

**Safety and Implementation Considerations**
- Emphasis on safety to prevent accidental driving
- Requirements: Raspberry Pi, CAN head, OBD2 cables
- Cost considerations and reverse engineering challenges

**Conclusion and Future Prospects**
- V2G stands for **Vehicle-to-Game**
- Project as a fun entry point into car hacking
- Open invitation for contributions and further development
