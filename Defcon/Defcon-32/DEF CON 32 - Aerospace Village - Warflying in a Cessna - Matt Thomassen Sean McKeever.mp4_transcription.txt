0.46s - 3.46s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Good morning, happy Sunday at DEF CON.
3.46s - 7.46s |  Thank you for coming to our talk, because we can.
7.46s - 10.46s |  Warflying in a Cessna.
10.46s - 14.46s |  I'm Sean McKeever, I'm a senior security researcher,
14.46s - 17.46s |  and I do other stuff from Metro Detroit.
17.46s - 19.46s |  Sometimes I race cars.
19.46s - 21.46s |  Matt Thomason, also Metro Detroit.
21.46s - 26.46s |  My day job is in security and has pretty much nothing whatsoever to do with warflying.
26.46s - 31.46s |  I am also a commercial multi-engine pilot, instrument rating,
31.46s - 34.46s |  and licensed airframe and powerplant mechanic.
34.46s - 40.46s |  And all of the opinions expressed here are our own,
40.46s - 43.46s |  and probably have nothing to do with our respective employers.
43.46s - 46.46s |  I didn't even tell them I was coming.
46.46s - 48.46s |  All right, so the story.
48.46s - 54.46s |  It's November 2019, and I was awash in a sea of mats, Matt.
54.46s - 56.46s |  This was our cube area.
56.46s - 60.46s |  I had a mat, and a mat, and a mat, coffee, and then a not-mat.
60.46s - 64.13s |  So we're sitting around.
64.13s - 65.13s |  It's, like I said, November.
65.13s - 69.13s |  DEF CON had come and gone, and Matt and I are like, let's do a DEF CON talk.
69.13s - 71.13s |  I'm like, yeah, but I tried that.
71.13s - 72.13s |  I can't talk about work.
72.13s - 75.13s |  What else are we going to talk about?
75.13s - 77.13s |  Matt goes, I have a plane.
77.13s - 79.13s |  Oh, Wi-Fi?
79.13s - 81.13s |  Yeah, let's do that.
81.13s - 88.78s |  And then 2020 happens.
88.78s - 92.78s |  So we did finally get together and do it.
92.78s - 96.78s |  Warflying, it's like war driving, or war dialing,
96.78s - 99.78s |  or as in greetings, Professor Falcon.
99.78s - 103.78s |  We're looking for wireless access points from the air,
103.78s - 106.78s |  and there are unfortunately no weapons involved.
106.78s - 107.78s |  Fortunately, I said fortunately.
107.78s - 109.78s |  Fortunately, yeah.
109.78s - 111.78s |  And so we're warflying into Cessna.
111.78s - 112.78s |  Not these Cessnas.
112.78s - 115.78s |  Cessna has actually made warplanes, but we weren't using those.
115.78s - 118.78s |  Although the L-19 on the bottom is kind of close.
118.78s - 122.78s |  If somebody wants to donate an L-19 for further research, please see me afterwards.
122.78s - 125.78s |  Our Cessna was more like this.
125.78s - 127.78s |  Cessna 182.
127.78s - 131.78s |  Not this airplane, because I think that one's registered for not in the U.S.
131.78s - 133.78s |  But four-seat airplane.
133.78s - 138.78s |  High wing, which gives us a little better visibility to the ground.
138.78s - 140.78s |  230-horsepower engine.
141.78s - 145.78s |  Cruises comfortably around 150 miles an hour.
145.78s - 150.78s |  And one nice thing is we've got six hours of fuel, so with reserve figure five hours,
150.78s - 155.78s |  we can go for a long time and long distance if we want to do such.
155.78s - 158.18s |  A few disclaimers.
158.18s - 160.18s |  This is not legal advice.
160.18s - 162.18s |  Neither of us is a lawyer.
162.18s - 164.18s |  This is not flight instruction.
164.18s - 165.18s |  We are not flight instructors.
165.18s - 168.18s |  We are also not expert war drivers.
168.18s - 173.18s |  But we are grateful to the war driving community that has made great tools like Wiggle
173.18s - 177.18s |  and many of those people are over in the RF hackers village.
177.18s - 179.18s |  And we're not the first to do this.
179.18s - 184.18s |  During our research, found that about 20 years ago, somebody wrote a paper on collecting data
184.18s - 189.18s |  on wireless access points from the air, but there doesn't seem to have been a lot of discussion
189.18s - 192.18s |  or work on the topic since then.
192.18s - 197.18s |  So we thought it was worth doing some experimenting and firing up the conversation again.
197.18s - 199.53s |  Why would we do this?
199.53s - 202.53s |  Big reason, three magic words, line of sight.
202.53s - 211.53s |  Radio frequencies, especially in the Wi-Fi ranges, are very subject to interference from the ground,
211.53s - 214.53s |  from objects, vegetation, buildings, houses.
214.53s - 218.53s |  Am I hopefully doing okay with my mic position here?
218.53s - 220.53s |  But am I?
220.53s - 221.53s |  Is that better?
221.53s - 222.53s |  Okay.
222.53s - 223.53s |  Hey, okay.
223.53s - 224.53s |  I should know how to do this.
224.53s - 235.53s |  Anyway, so trying to raise one end of the device on the end of the radio conversation,
235.53s - 239.53s |  potentially we have much greater distance and much greater line of sight.
239.53s - 240.53s |  And airplanes are cool.
240.53s - 241.53s |  Radios are cool.
241.53s - 242.53s |  We were curious.
242.53s - 247.53s |  Maybe we can see a lot of access points quickly.
247.53s - 255.53s |  And there's a fair amount of discussion right now about the interaction of aircraft and RF
255.53s - 258.53s |  and what radio signals can do with those.
258.53s - 260.53s |  So we thought it was an interesting topic to explore.
260.53s - 262.53s |  A few constraints we'll talk through.
262.53s - 264.53s |  One, safety.
264.53s - 270.53s |  And I'm going to belabor this a little bit because I don't want to read any NTSB reports
270.53s - 274.53s |  about somebody who crashed an airplane trying to look for wireless access points.
274.53s - 280.53s |  So, seriously, the job of the pilot in this is fly the airplane.
280.53s - 285.53s |  And this is often expressed in aviation as aviate, navigate, and communicate.
285.53s - 295.53s |  First job, aviate, which is keep the airplane flying, keep the shiny side up,
295.53s - 298.53s |  keep it at a proper airspeed, don't run into anything.
299.53s - 304.53s |  If and only if you are successfully aviating, then figure out where you are
304.53s - 306.53s |  and figure out where you're going.
306.53s - 310.53s |  If and only if you are successfully aviating and navigating,
310.53s - 314.53s |  then maybe think about talking to somebody on the radio about what you're doing.
314.53s - 318.53s |  At no point in here get distracted by scanning equipment,
318.53s - 321.53s |  shiny electronic displays in the airplane.
321.53s - 323.53s |  Ah, that looks cool.
324.53s - 329.53s |  Particularly during critical phases of flight, taxi takeoff, approach, landing,
329.53s - 332.53s |  and low-level maneuvering because when you're doing warflying,
332.53s - 337.53s |  you may want to be down closer to the ground, and that increases risk.
337.53s - 343.53s |  Is it possible to, or so, because of this, warflying we think is best done as a team sport
343.53s - 346.53s |  because, hey, it's more fun to share the flight with somebody anyway.
346.53s - 349.53s |  Is it possible to warfly safely while solo?
349.53s - 353.53s |  We'll talk about the details of that a little bit later,
353.53s - 356.53s |  but obviously we want to be watching the constraints.
356.53s - 365.53s |  I will mention this issue specifically as a reference to why I'm concerned about this.
365.53s - 369.53s |  Not that long ago, not very far away from where we live,
369.53s - 374.53s |  there was a Cessna 182 that crashed, and based on the NTSB report,
374.53s - 379.53s |  there's strong evidence that the pilot was in the process of taking a Snapchat video
379.53s - 383.53s |  and making a post and got distracted, got a little left of the course,
383.53s - 386.53s |  flew into the guy wires of a tower, crashed, and died.
386.53s - 393.53s |  So distraction, especially during low-level maneuvering, can be fatal.
393.53s - 396.53s |  So please, please, please, pilot, fly the airplane.
396.53s - 401.53s |  And if you are flying with the pilot, as the scanner,
401.53s - 410.53s |  if the pilot is not comfortable doing something, don't do it, and don't distract the pilot.
410.53s - 417.53s |  Regulations, basically the FAA says it's the responsibility of the aircraft operator
417.53s - 422.53s |  to determine if the portable electronic device will interfere with the operation of the aircraft.
422.53s - 427.53s |  So as a pilot, figure out will this interfere with the operation of the aircraft.
427.53s - 438.70s |  Also, remember FAR 91.3, the pilot in command of an aircraft is directly responsible for
438.70s - 441.70s |  and is the final authority as to the operation of that aircraft.
441.70s - 449.70s |  So if you are the scanner, the pilot's word is law on safety things.
449.70s - 454.70s |  Also, 91.13, the great catch-all, careless and reckless operation is prohibited.
454.70s - 461.70s |  So don't do anything stupid while you're flying around trying to collect access point data.
461.70s - 466.70s |  FCC perspective, FCC basically does not want cell phones in cell phone mode
466.70s - 468.70s |  trying to talk to cell phone towers while flying around.
468.70s - 472.70s |  So put your phone in airplane mode, and you can still have your Wi-Fi on,
472.70s - 481.70s |  have your GPS on, which are what you need for collecting wireless access point data.
481.70s - 483.70s |  Where can you war flight?
483.70s - 484.70s |  Know your airspace.
484.70s - 490.70s |  So we're from Metro Detroit area, and Detroit Metro Airport has this nice big thing
490.70s - 496.70s |  called a Class Bravo airspace, which you can visualize as an upside-down wedding cake
496.70s - 502.70s |  centered around the primary airport, and the Class Bravo airspace is well-protected,
502.70s - 507.70s |  and you can only get in there with explicit permission either if you're on an instrument flight plan
507.70s - 511.70s |  or if the approach controllers say you can come in here.
511.70s - 517.70s |  This is a very good safety thing because it lets all of the airliners get in and out safely,
517.70s - 521.70s |  heavy traffic areas, and it works well.
521.70s - 525.70s |  For what we're doing, we are probably not on an instrument flight plan
525.70s - 528.70s |  unless we happen to be war flying while we're going somewhere,
528.70s - 531.70s |  but if we're trying to gather data about a specific area,
531.70s - 534.70s |  we're probably operating under something called visual flight rules,
534.70s - 540.70s |  which means we're doing our own navigation and we're responsible for our own traffic separation,
540.70s - 543.70s |  but we've got a lot of flexibility in where we can do that.
543.70s - 546.70s |  But we need to stay out of the Class Bravo for sure,
546.70s - 549.70s |  and then there are smaller airports that we want to be watching for
549.70s - 553.70s |  so we don't go get in their traffic patterns and runways.
553.70s - 558.70s |  Pontiac Airport that we fly out of is a Class Delta, so they have a control tower.
558.70s - 560.70s |  They own that airspace.
561.70s - 565.70s |  They're pretty nice and flexible on working with us for maneuvering that we need to do,
565.70s - 567.70s |  and so you have a lot more options out of Class Delta airspace,
567.70s - 574.70s |  but at the end of the day, it's their airspace, so we have to comply with what they want.
574.70s - 579.70s |  Over populated areas, it's legal to fly 1,000 feet.
579.70s - 582.70s |  You have to stay 1,000 feet above the ground.
582.70s - 586.70s |  Over unpopulated areas, you can go down to 500 feet.
586.70s - 590.70s |  Where we were trying to fly, like over the suburbs of Metro Detroit,
590.70s - 595.70s |  we basically had an area between 1,000 feet and 3,000 feet above the ground
595.70s - 602.70s |  that we could get in to maintain clearance above the ground but stay below the Class Bravo shelf.
602.70s - 613.70s |  So that kind of constrained where we were able to go, but we were able to collect some good data.
613.70s - 618.70s |  Also, an airplane is a metal box, or at least a lot of them.
618.70s - 622.70s |  Cessna 182 is an aluminum box with plexiglass windows,
622.70s - 627.70s |  so we want to get the radios up out of the aluminum box
627.70s - 632.70s |  and put them as close as we can to the plexiglass windows so that they can receive Wi-Fi,
632.70s - 635.70s |  and that was one of the things that we were curious about,
635.70s - 644.70s |  how well does this work if we're inside the airplane and just getting the radios through the plexiglass?
644.70s - 647.70s |  So next year, I'm going to be outside the airplane?
647.70s - 649.70s |  Yes.
649.70s - 654.70s |  Yeah, we'll attach a safety line, though, so it'll work well.
654.70s - 658.70s |  Optimally, the antenna would be outside the airplane,
658.70s - 662.70s |  but you get into some issues with regs and safety and stuff,
662.70s - 664.70s |  one, if you're trying to permanently attach them to the airplane,
664.70s - 668.70s |  and two, just practically, you don't want to try attaching them
668.70s - 671.70s |  and then have it not work and fall off,
671.70s - 674.70s |  and then you're calling the tower saying,
674.70s - 677.70s |  hey, can you see if my phone fell off on the runway?
677.70s - 685.18s |  Also, from a privacy perspective, this is probably the least stealthy way to war drive
685.18s - 688.18s |  because you're in a big metal box making a lot of noise,
688.18s - 691.18s |  flying over everybody's head with a 12-inch tail number on the back of the airplane
691.18s - 693.18s |  and constantly chirping ADS-B packets,
694.18s - 699.18s |  telling everybody exactly who you are and exactly where you are.
699.18s - 702.18s |  People will call and complain about aircraft doing annoying things,
702.18s - 705.18s |  so please be a good citizen.
705.18s - 707.18s |  Don't be a jerk.
707.18s - 709.18s |  Don't go buzz people's houses.
709.18s - 713.18s |  Probably don't go orbit somebody's house 10 times
713.18s - 718.78s |  because that can collect some negative attention.
718.78s - 720.78s |  So, yeah, data collection.
720.78s - 723.78s |  We did a series of test flights, kind of figuring it out as we went.
723.78s - 728.78s |  The first flight, we took one phone, this Google Pixel,
728.78s - 731.78s |  which thankfully my girlfriend had to use because my phones are Apple,
731.78s - 733.78s |  but we put Wiggle on it.
733.78s - 736.78s |  I just kind of held it in my lap and we kind of flew around,
736.78s - 744.50s |  largely 1,500 to 2,500 feet at roughly 150 miles an hour.
744.50s - 747.50s |  And, you know, where are the access points?
747.50s - 748.50s |  We don't know.
748.50s - 751.50s |  We know where we started seeing them and where we stopped seeing them,
751.50s - 754.50s |  so we kind of have, like, a blob for each one,
754.50s - 758.50s |  but we can't say, oh, that's at Sean's house down there.
758.50s - 761.50s |  If we can see them more than once over multiple flights,
761.50s - 764.50s |  we could maybe pinpoint it a little better, but it's very inexact.
764.50s - 768.50s |  So for our first flight, we took three passes down Woodward Avenue,
768.50s - 771.50s |  which if you're a fan of cars,
771.50s - 773.50s |  it's where they have the Woodward Dream Cruise,
773.50s - 775.50s |  and, you know, we're from automotive.
775.50s - 777.50s |  It's also Highway 1 in Michigan.
777.50s - 782.50s |  We did two at 2,500 feet above sea level, which is 1,500 above ground,
782.50s - 785.50s |  and then one at 3,500, which is 2,500 feet,
785.50s - 788.50s |  with just my Android phone running.
788.50s - 792.50s |  And this map doesn't make a ton of sense to me because I'm not a pilot,
792.50s - 796.50s |  but you can see the various airspaces that we were operating in,
796.50s - 802.50s |  and the orange-yellow squiggles are our actual flight path.
802.50s - 804.50s |  But for me, this makes more sense.
804.50s - 807.50s |  This is actually a road map of where we were flying.
807.50s - 810.50s |  So the circles you can see on the right side,
810.50s - 813.50s |  that would be our laps around Woodward.
813.50s - 816.68s |  So data formats.
816.68s - 819.68s |  Wiggle has their own proprietary format as a KML file,
819.68s - 821.68s |  but they'll also output a CSV.
821.68s - 824.68s |  We get one entry per observation out of Wiggle,
824.68s - 827.68s |  so we can track how many times we saw a specific point.
827.68s - 830.68s |  And it also includes altitude, which is nice for us,
830.68s - 832.68s |  so we can correlate also that to our flight plan
832.68s - 835.68s |  and where we were and whatnot.
835.68s - 837.68s |  And then what counts as airborne detection?
837.68s - 840.68s |  Because we're seeing, as soon as we fire up the phone, we're seeing things.
840.68s - 844.68s |  We capped that at 500 feet above ground level is when we're going to consider it.
844.68s - 846.68s |  We caught it in the air.
846.68s - 854.50s |  And then we got home and we looked at the data and went, oh, there's a lot.
854.50s - 857.50s |  I wasn't a lot more than we were expecting.
857.50s - 861.50s |  And full disclosure, we both used GPT to help us with some Python
861.50s - 863.50s |  to figure this stuff out.
863.50s - 867.50s |  So on our first flight, again, our maximum altitude, 3,500 feet,
867.50s - 870.50s |  we were in the air for about 32 minutes above 500,
870.50s - 877.50s |  and we caught 2,822 unique BSS IDs or MAC addresses while we were in the air,
877.50s - 879.50s |  which is 88 per minute.
879.50s - 882.03s |  How far away?
882.03s - 887.03s |  We did a lot of, like, mapping, trying to calculate distance and such,
887.03s - 889.03s |  and I was curious what the official spec is.
889.03s - 894.03s |  The Wi-Fi Alliance doesn't really say explicitly Wi-Fi is good for this range,
894.03s - 896.03s |  but it's about 150 feet.
896.03s - 899.03s |  We kind of went past that quite a bit.
899.03s - 904.47s |  So this is our first attempt to analyze the data.
904.47s - 909.47s |  And if you look at it a little closely, you'll notice we have the same distance
909.47s - 912.47s |  for every single device that we caught, right?
912.47s - 913.47s |  The first sets of them.
913.47s - 917.47s |  The first sets of them.
917.47s - 918.47s |  So then we flew again.
918.47s - 921.47s |  We took a second flight, and this was your flight, right?
921.47s - 922.47s |  Yeah.
922.47s - 928.47s |  So then I was asking the question, okay, is it okay to warfly safely when you're solo?
928.47s - 932.47s |  And I needed to go do some takeoffs and landings, so I thought, well, hey,
932.47s - 934.47s |  maybe I'll fire up the phone.
934.47s - 939.47s |  So what I did, my procedure was fire up the phone during preflight,
939.47s - 943.47s |  before the airplane's on, start Wiggle, leave it there.
943.47s - 944.47s |  Don't touch it.
944.47s - 945.47s |  Don't mess with it.
945.47s - 946.47s |  Don't worry about it.
946.47s - 951.47s |  And then go fly, come back, shut the airplane down, get everything good,
951.47s - 953.47s |  then check the Wiggle data.
953.47s - 954.47s |  And that worked.
954.47s - 959.47s |  For this, I went to the ñ there's kind of a northeast practice area that's over an unpopulated area,
959.47s - 962.47s |  a lot of flight training activity goes on up there.
962.47s - 966.47s |  So I went to see what I could collect.
966.47s - 972.47s |  Went up to 2,500 feet, 54 minutes, just under 6,000 access points for a rate,
972.47s - 976.47s |  which ñ and I think this is a unique metric that nobody else has published.
976.47s - 977.47s |  I could be wrong.
977.47s - 978.47s |  I don't know.
978.47s - 979.47s |  Maybe the war drivers do it.
979.47s - 983.47s |  But max per minute.
983.47s - 984.47s |  So got 108 max per minute.
984.47s - 988.47s |  Test 3, similar exercise, just going up, flying around a little bit.
988.47s - 990.47s |  Myself had the phone mounted the same way.
990.47s - 997.47s |  And got ñ went up 6,500 feet, about 7,000 max, 130 max per minute.
997.47s - 1003.47s |  And then was working on the distance analysis and saw for that flight,
1003.47s - 1007.47s |  we had like over a dozen where we had a starting and ending range
1007.47s - 1011.47s |  where we saw them over a range of over 5 kilometers.
1011.47s - 1015.47s |  So we were seeing them from a couple miles away, pretty sure.
1015.47s - 1020.47s |  Top access points on this one, the top was 9 kilometers,
1020.47s - 1028.47s |  and then saw several of these 000D97s.
1028.47s - 1031.47s |  And I don't know what they are, but it's registered to Hitachi Energy USA.
1031.47s - 1036.47s |  So we're wondering if it's some kind of IoT energy distribution something.
1036.47s - 1039.47s |  We did talk to the ICS village folks, and they said, yeah, probably.
1040.47s - 1042.47s |  Test 4, biennial flight review.
1042.47s - 1046.47s |  The quick story on that one was I was with an instructor
1046.47s - 1048.47s |  but didn't have time to pay attention to the phone.
1048.47s - 1053.47s |  Got back, and I just put it in my flight bag to see what would happen.
1053.47s - 1057.47s |  And got back and realized that I didn't have any data.
1057.47s - 1061.47s |  So the good thing was ñ or the bad thing was we lost the data.
1061.47s - 1065.47s |  The good thing was I demonstrated that I was not getting distracted by the phone.
1066.47s - 1070.47s |  And then ñ thank you.
1070.47s - 1072.47s |  Don't get distracted by the phone.
1072.47s - 1079.47s |  Test flight number 5, there is a path that you can take that's kind of a scenic river tour
1079.47s - 1082.47s |  that avoids the controlled airspaces in downtown Detroit.
1082.47s - 1086.47s |  So we decided to do that for our next test flight.
1086.47s - 1090.47s |  And fun for flying, you get to take pictures like this.
1090.47s - 1093.47s |  So we decided we're using two phones.
1093.47s - 1096.47s |  Can we get data a better way or a different way?
1096.47s - 1100.47s |  So I also brought along a laptop running Linux with LINSSID on it,
1100.47s - 1105.47s |  stuffed a USB Wi-Fi card in the window.
1105.47s - 1110.47s |  And then you can see, again, my Pixel in the handle of the plane.
1110.47s - 1116.47s |  Matt's Android was on the other side of the plane in his handle.
1119.07s - 1124.07s |  So we started counting MAC addresses at different altitudes through LINSSID
1124.07s - 1129.07s |  and correlating that with Wiggle as well.
1129.07s - 1134.07s |  So with LINSSID, I got 10,208 unique MAC addresses.
1134.07s - 1138.07s |  Wiggle on my phone was super underperforming on this flight for some reason.
1138.07s - 1145.83s |  It only got 2,753, but Matt was able to grab, again, almost 8,000.
1145.83s - 1149.83s |  And then we, again, tried to do distance analysis on it.
1149.83s - 1153.83s |  So we've got, again, our topping out at almost 10 kilometers,
1153.83s - 1156.83s |  but most of them, you know, 5 or 6.
1156.83s - 1159.83s |  And then I broke down the LINSSID specifically as well.
1159.83s - 1163.83s |  And one thing, when I – LINSSID, you can tune it.
1163.83s - 1165.83s |  I turned it all the way down so it would sample constantly.
1165.83s - 1167.83s |  That was a really bad idea.
1167.83s - 1171.83s |  I had 2 gigabytes of data to try and wrangle.
1171.83s - 1178.83s |  But here's a list of the longest-duration SSIDs I was able to catch out of LINSSID.
1178.83s - 1181.83s |  I still have the MAC addresses or the BSSIDs.
1181.83s - 1186.83s |  But, yeah, the Krusty Krab is apparently a really long-range Wi-Fi network in Metro Detroit.
1186.83s - 1193.33s |  And a minute and a half of observation is about 5.5 kilometers.
1193.33s - 1196.33s |  And this is that same flight plan, right?
1196.33s - 1197.33s |  Yeah, so this is the flight plan.
1197.33s - 1199.33s |  So we wanted to compare altitudes.
1199.33s - 1202.33s |  So we basically – so I was using ForeFlight.
1202.33s - 1205.33s |  Flew kind of an S pattern over Lake Orion and Oxford, Michigan.
1205.33s - 1210.33s |  Thank you to the citizens of Lake Orion and Oxford for letting us bother your skies that day.
1210.33s - 1216.33s |  One path at 2,500 feet and then climbed up to 3,500 feet and tried to just follow the same path.
1216.33s - 1220.33s |  And you see how well I did or did not do.
1220.33s - 1227.33s |  So at 1,500, altitude of 1,500, we got 101, again, max per minute.
1227.33s - 1230.33s |  When we increase that by 1,000 feet, we're getting 49.
1230.33s - 1239.15s |  So you can see the signals are starting to degrade the higher we're getting, but we're still getting some significant traffic.
1239.15s - 1240.15s |  Wait, oh, I'm sorry.
1240.15s - 1242.15s |  I'm hitting the wrong button.
1242.15s - 1244.15s |  So, yeah, did we go too fast?
1244.15s - 1245.15s |  I don't know.
1245.15s - 1249.15s |  I don't think that's a thing you can do is go too fast.
1249.15s - 1254.15s |  Yeah, so this was one thing that we would like to explore more is what is the speed?
1254.15s - 1258.15s |  Because we were going about 220 feet per second horizontally.
1258.15s - 1264.15s |  Seagulls seem to be taking samples about every five seconds, so that's about 1,100 feet per sample.
1264.15s - 1270.53s |  So that may have impacted our ability to scan.
1270.53s - 1272.53s |  And then we still had this kind of nagging question.
1272.53s - 1273.53s |  Are we seeing a lot of data?
1273.53s - 1275.53s |  Are we seeing more than we should be?
1275.53s - 1276.53s |  Are we seeing less than we should be?
1276.53s - 1278.53s |  So we decided to do some more driving.
1278.53s - 1288.53s |  And since we love Woodward Avenue, decided to go do a ward drive from 11-mile road to Square Lake Road on Woodward, which is a distance of 9.8 miles.
1288.53s - 1290.53s |  And you see the results there.
1290.53s - 1295.53s |  Ward driving, we took 14 minutes to cover that path, speed of 42 miles an hour.
1295.53s - 1301.53s |  And we observed 2,210 MAC addresses for a rate of 157 MACs per minute.
1301.53s - 1308.53s |  Ward flying, we went a lot faster, covered the distance in four minutes at 148 miles an hour, got about a third the number of MACs.
1308.53s - 1314.53s |  We got a lot less MACs, 783, but we collected them a lot faster at 197 MACs per minute.
1314.53s - 1323.53s |  So our conclusion from that is that, at least in this case, ward driving collects more MACs, but ward flying collects them faster.
1323.53s - 1324.53s |  Right.
1324.53s - 1325.53s |  So take your pick.
1325.53s - 1328.53s |  I would say flying is probably more fun.
1328.53s - 1331.53s |  So yeah, a little more distance analysis.
1331.53s - 1338.53s |  This is on the stretch down Woodward Avenue, which we had a discrete starting and stopping distance without any overlap.
1338.53s - 1347.53s |  So we could get a clear measure of how long we could see a signal without worrying about, oh, was it looping around and whatnot?
1347.53s - 1352.53s |  So, again, our maximum distance here is about four kilometers.
1352.53s - 1359.53s |  What I find, one of the things I find really interesting, again, we got a car and then Uconnect based on a past thing I used to do.
1359.53s - 1360.53s |  We love Uconnect.
1360.53s - 1361.53s |  Right.
1361.53s - 1362.53s |  I love Uconnect.
1362.53s - 1363.53s |  Yes, yes.
1363.53s - 1367.53s |  But so we were able to catch cars from the air while we were flying down Woodward.
1367.53s - 1369.53s |  Sorry, this was the ward drive.
1369.53s - 1370.53s |  Oh, was that the ward drive one?
1370.53s - 1371.53s |  Yeah, this was the ward drive one.
1371.53s - 1381.53s |  And so what we see from here is the distance, because our top distances on the ward flying were like nine kilometers, five kilometers.
1381.53s - 1383.53s |  These are down to like four.
1384.53s - 1386.53s |  So we're pretty sure we were just tracking cars.
1386.53s - 1393.53s |  And then our old friend 000D97 shows up again, something fairly visible from wherever.
1393.53s - 1399.90s |  But we were getting a lot less distance clearly with the ward driving versus the ward flying.
1399.90s - 1400.90s |  And then?
1400.90s - 1404.90s |  And then when you fly, you have to take a cockpit selfie because it's cool.
1404.90s - 1405.90s |  Right.
1405.90s - 1406.90s |  And I can be like.
1406.90s - 1407.90s |  It's so cool.
1407.90s - 1408.90s |  I was flying.
1408.90s - 1409.90s |  You got to do it twice.
1409.90s - 1415.01s |  Way to do it again.
1415.01s - 1419.01s |  Further investigation, you know, different speeds and altitudes.
1419.01s - 1422.01s |  I would really love to just, you know, every 500 feet, same route and all that.
1422.01s - 1425.01s |  But that takes a lot of time, uses a lot of fuel.
1425.01s - 1426.01s |  Aircraft construction.
1426.01s - 1431.01s |  Do we get better results if we're in a composite aircraft without metal wrapping around us?
1431.01s - 1436.01s |  And if somebody wants to donate a Cirrus for further research, please also see me afterwards.
1436.01s - 1443.01s |  Hardware platforms, maybe using some drones that could carry a payload, antenna placement, additional radios.
1443.01s - 1448.01s |  And then directional antennas, et cetera.
1448.01s - 1449.01s |  Yeah.
1449.01s - 1451.01s |  So that's what we got.
1451.01s - 1452.01s |  So thank you.
1452.01s - 1453.01s |  Thank you all for coming out.
1453.01s - 1458.01s |  Thanks to Pontiac Tower and Detroit Approach for working with us, even though they had no idea what we were doing up there.
1458.01s - 1459.01s |  Thanks to all the mats.
1459.01s - 1461.01s |  There were more of them.
1461.01s - 1462.01s |  Yes.
1462.01s - 1465.01s |  Their mats at the Aerospace Village were all over the place.
1465.01s - 1466.01s |  All right.
1466.01s - 1467.01s |  Thank you all.
