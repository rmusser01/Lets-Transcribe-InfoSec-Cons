 So, since I've seen many hands when James asked whose first DEF CON it is, you may think
12.30s - 14.22s |  this is something is going wrong.
14.22s - 19.30s |  No, actually this is the DEF CON way of doing things.
19.30s - 24.26s |  Since everything went perfect, we decided to make some adjustments and fuck up some
24.26s - 25.76s |  things and we succeeded.
25.76s - 28.14s |  Thank you.
28.14s - 29.82s |  This is the DEF CON way.
29.82s - 32.46s |  Welcome to the sixth APSEC Village.
32.46s - 39.14s |  This was started in 2019 by Leora, the queen, you may have seen her, in the entrance and
39.14s - 40.44s |  myself.
40.44s - 43.50s |  Since then, it's no longer our thing, it's your thing.
43.50s - 45.86s |  Our community is getting bigger and bigger.
45.86s - 52.94s |  Last year we had 8,000 people across the APSEC Village in DEF CON and we hope to break that
52.94s - 57.10s |  record this time, so bring your friends.
57.10s - 60.38s |  I wanted to say a few words, I will not because we don't have time.
60.38s - 65.42s |  I'm just going to present now Alyse and Tanisha, they're going to show us something that is
65.42s - 68.52s |  very on theme for Vegas and DEF CON.
68.52s - 78.11s |  Thank you, take it away.
78.11s - 80.07s |  How about now?
80.07s - 83.79s |  My name is Tanisha Martin, I am the executive director and founder of a non-profit called
83.79s - 85.19s |  Black Girls Hack.
85.19s - 88.35s |  I am also a hacker, a wife.
88.35s - 93.35s |  Excuse me, I've got about five master's degrees and a doctoral degree that's loading.
93.35s - 99.27s |  I am the CEO of BDH Security and a gambler, which is going to be relevant to this conversation.
99.27s - 105.23s |  I also do AI and cyber security at the intersection of penetration testing research.
105.23s - 114.42s |  Hey.
114.42s - 115.42s |  Hi.
115.42s - 116.42s |  Hi.
116.42s - 121.42s |  I'm Alyse McGowan, the CSO for Black Girls Hack, a wife, cyber security analyst, hacker,
121.42s - 130.42s |  I also have a PhD in computer science, a baby gambler, and also a researcher of cyber security
131.30s - 142.97s |  All right, so we're going to be providing a brief introduction to the topic, which is
142.97s - 146.93s |  basically security concerns, application security concerns within the casino industry.
146.93s - 153.81s |  We'll be talking about the importance of cyber security and within the gaming industry itself,
153.81s - 160.09s |  and then we'll provide an overview of the session's objectives and the key focus areas.
160.09s - 161.57s |  So let me set the scene.
161.57s - 165.45s |  When you drive into a casino, they literally see you coming.
165.81s - 168.93s |  They have license plate readers, which basically read your license plate before you even get
168.93s - 173.81s |  to the building, and before you even step foot into the casino, they've got your face
173.81s - 180.77s |  on one of over, you know, 200, sorry, is it 200, 2,000, yeah, 2,000 cameras that connect
180.77s - 184.61s |  to about 50 to 75 different monitors within the space.
184.61s - 189.37s |  When you get to the front desk, they'll ask you for your ID at most casinos just to make
189.37s - 192.01s |  sure that you're of age.
192.01s - 195.73s |  But their surveillance state exceeds far beyond just the casino floor.
195.73s - 201.57s |  They've also got surveillance of things like the, what's it called, relational Nora, which
201.57s - 206.93s |  is non-obvious relationship awareness to uncover relationships between things like the players
206.93s - 211.17s |  and dealers and things of that nature, because they not only want to know about what's going
211.17s - 215.69s |  on on the floor itself, but they also want to know about any potential cheating or anything
215.69s - 222.09s |  like that and relationships that are going on between people within the casino industry.
222.09s - 227.29s |  So in 2008, a guy named Jeff Jonas, who helped develop the facial recognition system that
227.29s - 233.13s |  are used within most Las Vegas casinos, said that casinos would prefer to spend the minimum
233.13s - 236.77s |  amount of security, that should be a surprise to no one, and they would actually prefer
236.77s - 242.37s |  to buy three more slot machines rather than spend that money on security.
242.37s - 247.97s |  The second thing that I would say is that within casinos, they care more, much more
247.97s - 254.65s |  about information than I think they do anything else, including money.
254.65s - 260.73s |  And the reason being is that they are looking for information they can use to basically
260.73s - 262.09s |  direct their marketing.
262.09s - 266.21s |  So they want to figure out what are the ways that they can use to get you to spend the
266.21s - 267.53s |  most amount of money.
267.53s - 273.41s |  So they do things like check your browsing history, your educational information, information
273.41s - 279.61s |  about your preferences and proclivities, commercial activities, psychological trends, predispositions,
279.61s - 280.61s |  et cetera.
280.61s - 285.93s |  So when you use their systems, they track your precise location within the casinos while
285.93s - 289.33s |  you're in each of their locations at each moment.
289.33s - 292.01s |  But of course, this is only for marketing purposes.
292.01s - 294.85s |  So you don't have to worry about it.
294.85s - 301.41s |  So cyber criminals, in addition to absolutely loving money, absolutely also love data, which
301.41s - 304.41s |  casinos tend to collect a large amount of.
304.41s - 309.69s |  But as you can imagine, with millions of visitors each year, a billion-dollar market cap, multi-billion
309.69s - 315.41s |  dollar, $300 billion market cap, and annual growth about 5%, casinos have a large amount
315.41s - 318.85s |  of data on a very large amount of people.
318.85s - 328.41s |  And one thing that the industry cannot live without, it's also, if you have the one thing
328.41s - 330.73s |  that bad guys can't live without, what do you do?
330.73s - 331.73s |  You hold it for ransom.
331.73s - 332.73s |  Okay.
332.73s - 336.01s |  So allow me to set the scene.
336.01s - 337.01s |  The players.
337.01s - 342.49s |  So if we imagine the casino cyber attacks as a high-stakes game of poker, but with cybersecurity.
342.49s - 347.17s |  So the players, the house, normally the house has the advantage with extensive security
347.17s - 350.85s |  measures in place to protect its assets.
350.85s - 355.33s |  The cyber criminals, hackers, skilled players who are looking to outsmart the house using
355.33s - 357.65s |  their expertise in technology.
357.65s - 363.33s |  The game, the deck, cybersecurity system, represents the various security protocols
363.33s - 367.21s |  and measures in place to protect the casino's digital assets.
367.21s - 373.09s |  The hand, sensitive data, the valuable information the household holds, which in this case, the
373.09s - 375.41s |  personal details of customers.
375.41s - 379.61s |  The play, the hackers ante up, find a vulnerability.
379.61s - 385.33s |  They look for a weakness in the casino security to gain an initial foothold.
385.33s - 387.73s |  The bluff, social engineering.
387.73s - 391.93s |  Hackers use deception like phishing and other tactics to trick employees into giving up
391.93s - 393.89s |  access to information.
393.89s - 396.45s |  The raise, system infiltration.
396.45s - 401.69s |  Once inside, they increase their access and control over the casino system.
401.69s - 403.73s |  The all-in, data breach.
403.73s - 408.69s |  Hackers go for the jackpot, attempting to extract as much valuable data as they can.
408.69s - 414.77s |  The showdown, the fold, the system shutdown, the casino realizing the breach, shuts down
414.77s - 417.21s |  the affected systems to stop the attack.
417.21s - 420.37s |  The call, investigation and response.
420.37s - 425.77s |  Casino responds by investigating the breach, notifying affected customers, and bolstering
425.77s - 428.81s |  their security measures to prevent these attacks.
428.81s - 432.89s |  In the end, the house must learn from the play, improve its hand, and be ready for the
432.89s - 438.01s |  next round with even better strategies to protect its assets.
438.01s - 440.37s |  Just like in the casino, the stakes are high.
440.37s - 444.69s |  The house must always be diligent to stay ahead of the game.
444.69s - 450.05s |  So today we're going to be talking about ransomware and breaches that are in the gaming industry.
450.05s - 456.37s |  So you should expect to be immersed into the history of malicious actors within this space.
456.37s - 459.97s |  We'll talk about some of the threat actors, some of their motivations, and some of those
459.97s - 465.17s |  sectors' unique application security challenges and responses, and how you can apply these
465.17s - 469.81s |  lessons learned to other industries outside of the industry.
469.81s - 470.81s |  Just a quick question.
470.81s - 471.81s |  Any gamblers here?
471.81s - 472.81s |  No?
472.81s - 473.81s |  Everyone's in Las Vegas?
473.81s - 474.81s |  Okay, we got a couple.
474.81s - 475.81s |  All right.
475.81s - 476.81s |  So I'm not alone.
476.81s - 477.81s |  That's wonderful.
477.81s - 480.15s |  All right.
480.15s - 481.15s |  Yeah.
481.15s - 487.15s |  So we're going to just cover this real briefly, just to make sure that you guys can see.
487.59s - 492.39s |  So if you're looking at the history of casino breaches, it started around 2014, and since
492.39s - 495.99s |  then there's probably been about 10 different security breaches.
495.99s - 501.07s |  Most recently you've probably seen in the news the breaches that happened with Caesars
501.07s - 503.51s |  and MGM last summer.
503.51s - 508.27s |  Those are pretty impactful and pretty widespread, and we're going to end with a case study talking
508.27s - 513.47s |  about those two so that you can see how the difference in responses basically led to two
513.47s - 516.59s |  drastically different outcomes for those companies themselves.
516.59s - 562.72s |  And we're modifying, trying to make it for the last time.
562.72s - 563.72s |  Okay.
563.72s - 568.68s |  Now that we've looked at the rising trend of cyberattacks within the casino industry,
568.68s - 575.00s |  it's essential to dissect the types of threats that they're dealing with, with the methodologies
575.00s - 577.72s |  that cybercriminals employ.
577.72s - 583.00s |  This understanding forms the basis of our strategy to combat the attacks effectively.
583.00s - 588.04s |  So let's begin with ransomware, the most notorious threat to operations.
588.04s - 592.92s |  Ransomware encrypts critical data, effectively holding operations hostage.
592.92s - 600.24s |  The demand for ransom is accompanied by threats of data exposure and also compounding of financial
600.24s - 602.04s |  and reputational damage.
602.04s - 607.64s |  Moreover, insider threats, whether malicious or unintentional, pose a significant risk.
607.64s - 614.16s |  These can involve employees who either knowingly or due to negligence provide cybercriminals
614.16s - 617.24s |  with access to sensitive systems and information.
617.24s - 622.20s |  The sophistication of these attacks highlights the necessity of adopting a multi-layered
622.20s - 623.56s |  security approach.
623.56s - 629.40s |  This involves not only advanced technical defenses, but also thorough training and policies
629.40s - 632.48s |  that minimize human error and mitigate insider threats.
632.48s - 636.36s |  All right.
636.36s - 639.36s |  So when we're looking at the casino industry, especially when we're just talking about some
639.36s - 643.52s |  of the ransomware and challenges that they face, some of the things that you may have
643.52s - 650.28s |  seen like, for example, last summer when they had a breach within MGM and Caesars was the
650.28s - 654.76s |  biggest noticeable thing was when you visited their website, for example, or if you visited
654.76s - 660.40s |  the mobile apps, a lot of the things that you as players and as both customers or people
660.40s - 665.32s |  within the hotel were able to see was that, for example, you weren't able to log into
665.32s - 668.24s |  your hotel room with your room keys, right?
668.24s - 673.00s |  So all of those systems were down, so they had to actually result to actual physical
673.00s - 678.52s |  keys as opposed to being able to log in, for example, with your Bluetooth or something
678.52s - 679.72s |  of that nature.
679.72s - 683.12s |  The other thing that was basically brought down was the ability to be able to track,
683.12s - 686.12s |  you know, for example, points, things of that nature.
686.12s - 690.52s |  A lot of transactions that happen within the casinos happen through, you know, like a point
690.52s - 693.80s |  system where you're basically building up comps and you use those to purchase things
693.80s - 695.28s |  within the casino.
695.28s - 697.48s |  So all of those systems were essentially brought down.
697.72s - 703.36s |  So, you know, everything from, you know, having to do paper receipt check-ins for them to
703.36s - 711.76s |  be able to log people into the hotels, physical keys to be able to access the room keys and
711.76s - 715.36s |  things of that nature, and they weren't able to do any of the traditional transactions
715.36s - 719.44s |  in terms of, you know, paying for food or anything of that nature.
719.44s - 723.04s |  In order to take credit cards, for example, they actually had to write down the credit
723.04s - 727.08s |  card information on pieces of paper to be processed later, which probably takes us back
727.08s - 728.36s |  probably about 20 years.
728.36s - 734.20s |  So, you know, all of these systems, when they were going through their, I guess, disaster
734.20s - 739.48s |  recovery plan, they did not consider what would happen if they basically lost access.
739.48s - 743.88s |  The other thing that I think that was interesting was, you know, not just the physical infrastructure
743.88s - 749.32s |  within the casinos that was messed up, but then also the games themselves.
749.32s - 753.52s |  So a lot of the slot machines, which are all in the same system, were basically turned
753.52s - 754.52s |  off.
754.52s - 757.56s |  The table games were also turned off because they were on the same system.
757.56s - 761.28s |  So in terms of contingency planning and things of that nature, you know, those failures,
761.28s - 767.36s |  I think, became super evident and obvious during the course of this breach, these breaches.
767.36s - 773.32s |  The other thing that we'll say is that they have some very unique ICT and IOT related
773.32s - 774.32s |  complexities.
774.32s - 784.48s |  And, you know, I think that for a lot of those complexities, we're going to be talking about
784.48s - 788.24s |  how some of those challenges exacerbated the vulnerabilities that were exposed through
788.24s - 793.22s |  the course of these ransomware attacks.
793.22s - 798.18s |  And as we integrate more advanced technologies into operations, we must be considerate of
798.18s - 801.26s |  the security risks that come with this expansion.
801.26s - 805.74s |  So we're going to explore how the benefits of technology integration also expand the
805.74s - 815.81s |  attack circuit introducing new vulnerabilities.
815.81s - 820.17s |  So as we're continuing our journey throughout the landscape facing the casino industry,
820.17s - 825.81s |  it's important to address some of the technological advancements that have propelled the industry
825.93s - 829.93s |  and made them very big targets for cyber security attacks outside of the fact that they have
829.93s - 833.93s |  large amounts of data and then also a large amount of money.
833.93s - 838.41s |  So one of those things is the use of ICT in the casinos.
838.41s - 843.05s |  I don't think you can see the slides anymore.
843.05s - 847.13s |  But casinos today, you know, are more than just vectors for gaming.
847.13s - 852.61s |  They also have entertainment complexes equipped with advanced technologies with IOT enabled
852.61s - 853.61s |  machines.
853.61s - 856.02s |  Aha!
856.02s - 857.02s |  Success!
857.02s - 868.86s |  So they've got IOT enabled systems that basically attach their slot machines, their surveillance
868.86s - 871.42s |  system, and all of those things as well.
871.42s - 875.70s |  So all of these present multiple attack vectors for cybercriminals.
875.70s - 878.66s |  So let's talk about some of those vulnerabilities.
878.66s - 883.42s |  When you consider the nature of these technologies, IOT devices by design are connected to the
883.42s - 884.42s |  Internet.
884.42s - 890.78s |  But they often have very minimal or lax, sorry, very minimal or lax security features.
890.78s - 894.26s |  So this makes them susceptible to a large amount of attacks from simple unauthorized
894.26s - 899.10s |  access to more sophisticated exploits like network hijacking.
899.10s - 904.46s |  Additionally, ICT systems that manage everything from the slot payouts to customer data and
904.46s - 908.84s |  centralized hubs that if breached can allow attackers to access critical systems.
908.84s - 913.96s |  So one of the things that I thought was interesting was that, you know, the MGM attack that was
913.96s - 919.40s |  in 2019, which was, you know, if you're doing the math, maybe four years or so before the
919.40s - 925.08s |  one that just happened last summer, it actually started when some attackers wanted to basically
925.08s - 926.80s |  take control of some slot machines.
926.80s - 931.44s |  So they went into the slot machines and whatever threat or vulnerabilities that they were trying
931.44s - 933.24s |  to exploit, it didn't work out.
933.24s - 937.04s |  So what happened was that they ended up just basically going and holding the entire system
937.04s - 938.04s |  for ransomware.
938.24s - 941.36s |  So it started off where they were just trying to take advantage of a couple of the slot
941.36s - 942.36s |  machines.
942.36s - 943.72s |  But that didn't work out.
943.72s - 946.44s |  They decided to pivot.
946.44s - 950.76s |  As we integrate more advanced technologies into operations, we have to be considerate
950.76s - 953.76s |  of the security risks that come with this expansion.
953.76s - 958.84s |  So let's explore how the benefits of technology integration also expand the attack surface
958.84s - 960.84s |  introducing new vulnerabilities.
960.84s - 967.60s |  With every new technology that's adopted from IoT devices to cloud-based services, we inadvertently
967.60s - 969.88s |  expand the attack surface.
969.88s - 973.52s |  This means more opportunities for cyber criminals to exploit.
973.52s - 979.52s |  Many systems are initially set up with weak authentication methods, making them more vulnerable
979.52s - 984.72s |  to unauthorized access, whether it's simple passwords or outdated access controls.
984.72s - 989.08s |  These weaknesses can open the door to cyber attackers.
989.08s - 993.20s |  So all of these risks point toward a central challenge, securing the network.
993.20s - 998.80s |  So network security is challenging in a highly interconnected environment where both wired
998.80s - 1003.24s |  and wireless communications are potential entry points for cyber threat.
1003.24s - 1007.37s |  All right.
1007.37s - 1010.21s |  So as promised, we're going to take a look at the two different responses.
1010.21s - 1012.01s |  Oh, I'm sorry.
1012.01s - 1013.01s |  In one minute.
1013.01s - 1014.01s |  Oh.
1014.01s - 1017.03s |  Oh, yes.
1017.03s - 1018.03s |  I'm sorry.
1018.03s - 1019.03s |  One minute.
1019.03s - 1022.23s |  We're going to take a look at the two different responses.
1022.23s - 1027.15s |  The gist of the responses were that Caesars basically paid the ransomware.
1027.15s - 1031.91s |  They were back up within four days, and MGM did not, and I think that they were out for
1031.91s - 1034.55s |  something like maybe 15 days or something like that.
1034.55s - 1038.87s |  So the impact between them, you know, Caesars paid the ransomware, which I think was like
1038.87s - 1039.87s |  $4 million.
1039.87s - 1046.83s |  MGM did not pay the ransomware, and they basically were out of, you know, a lot of the things
1046.83s - 1052.79s |  were disrupted for over the course of the 14 days or 15 days or whatever that was, and
1052.79s - 1057.99s |  ended up costing them over $30 million plus, you know, untold impact to the organizations
1057.99s - 1058.99s |  as a whole.
1058.99s - 1063.59s |  But that was just basically the difference between two exact same breaches.
1063.59s - 1064.59s |  All right.
1064.59s - 1072.77s |  So in the interest of time, because we don't want to go over and impact the rest of the
1072.77s - 1082.92s |  folks, we'll just open it up to any questions.
1082.92s - 1083.92s |  Any questions?
1083.92s - 1088.63s |  Thank you.
