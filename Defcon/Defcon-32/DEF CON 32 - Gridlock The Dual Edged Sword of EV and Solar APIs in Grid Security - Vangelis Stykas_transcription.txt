  "description": "In this talk, we delve deep into the increasingly interconnected world of electronic vehicles (EVs), photovoltaic (PV) solar systems, and the broader power grid infrastructure\u2014a nexus that is becoming a fertile ground for potential large-scale cyber disruptions. As we navigate through this complex interplay of technology and infrastructure, we will uncover the critical vulnerabilities lurking within the API connections that bind these systems together. Our exploration will not only highlight these weaknesses but will also demonstrate, through real-world scenarios and potential attack vectors, how they can be exploited to launch sophisticated cyber-attacks, emphasizing the urgent need for robust security frameworks and proactive cybersecurity measures to safeguard our collective future. The advent of PV inverters and EV charging systems has been marred by the industry's \"rush to market\" mentality, leading to overlooked security considerations.",

2.10s - 9.86s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Hello all. Can you hear me first of all? Okay, nice. I'm going to take a picture. If anyone
9.86s - 23.69s |  is not okay with that, please hide yourself. That's obligatory for my mom. She never believes
23.69s - 33.81s |  that people come and hear me talk. So, yeah. Kind of a thing. So, welcome to my talk. Gridlock,
33.81s - 41.87s |  the dual edge sort of EV and solar APIs in grid security. Fair warning, this talk is
41.87s - 49.75s |  PG 17, which means I love saying fuck and shit. So, if you're not comfortable with that,
49.75s - 58.11s |  can you please raise your hand? Everyone's okay with that? Really? Thank you for that.
58.11s - 63.63s |  That's me. I'm Vangelis Thikas. I'm the CTO at the penetration testing firm which specializes
63.79s - 72.74s |  in green energy, energy renewable and everything else, EV and PV penetration testing. What?
74.58s - 79.62s |  Okay. That's me. I'm Vangelis Thikas. I'm the CTO of a penetration testing firm
80.26s - 87.62s |  called Atropos. We're testing mainly EVs and PVs. My research industry is mainly APIs for IoT
87.62s - 92.58s |  and for the past couple of years, malware, ransomware and other things that might get
92.58s - 99.30s |  me killed. But, yeah. That's just me. So, this talk is about solar panels. I'm going to be
99.30s - 105.94s |  honest. I have no idea how they work. I'm not a solar panel specialist. I'm an API specialist.
106.58s - 111.14s |  This talk is about APIs. If you thought that you were going to see any kind of
111.14s - 116.66s |  solar shit or, I don't know, firmware things, you're on the wrong talk. Sorry about that.
117.22s - 123.06s |  Quick intro. There are two kinds of installations of solar panel. The one is home panels which is
123.06s - 128.34s |  from 1 kilowatt to 10 kilowatts. And then there are plants which is from 200 kilowatts to 20
128.34s - 135.54s |  megawatts. The home are usually on roof and they're integrated there. The plants are maximizing
135.54s - 142.34s |  profit and minimizing cost because, yeah, capitalism and shit. So, the solar market,
143.14s - 149.46s |  it has several big players. They're mainly Chinese. Lots, and I mean lots of white label
149.46s - 154.10s |  providers that provide generic implementation. We're going to see that they're really rushing
154.10s - 161.30s |  to market. And they have over 30 million current installations the past week that I checked.
162.90s - 168.18s |  Yeah, you can see that we are moving towards solar panels. So, more and more solar panel
168.98s - 177.94s |  energy is being used. Yeah, that's what the solar panel is. It consists of many cells,
177.94s - 183.22s |  blah, blah, blah, things I don't understand. Things that if you understand, I'm really happy
183.22s - 193.49s |  with you because you're really smart. But do you know what that is? So, that's Fortnite.
194.13s - 201.41s |  My older son is playing Fortnite and he loves it. And apparently everyone who wins him either
201.41s - 210.53s |  is a cheater or, I don't know, a hacker. And once upon a time there was a guy Tesla 2004 that
210.53s - 219.81s |  kind of kicked his ass. So, we went after him for no apparent reason other than me being petty.
220.61s - 225.41s |  So, what's the solar market? So, the solar market generates more than a terawatt globally.
225.41s - 231.57s |  A terawatt is a little bit less than what the states, the USA, is consuming every day.
232.37s - 236.69s |  It's cheaper to produce. It has low maintenance and it can run unsupervised.
237.33s - 242.85s |  But as it is expensive to store, it is easier to throw it to the grid, which,
244.53s - 248.37s |  yeah, I don't know if you understand what they are doing. They are just throwing
249.01s - 258.13s |  and depending stuff that is not there every day. I'm introducing you horror scenario. The horror
258.13s - 265.01s |  scenario was a scenario that was built by a really smart guy that I cannot really pronounce his name
265.01s - 270.37s |  because it has too many syllables. Sorry about that, Marcus. I'm gonna read it. It's the only
270.37s - 274.61s |  wall of text that I'm going to read. The power grid needs to maintain a constant balance between
274.61s - 280.53s |  supply or power. Its supply exceeds demands. There is, however, a limit to these countermeasures.
280.53s - 286.53s |  So, they're doing some countermeasures. We need to maintain balance. But especially in Europe,
287.73s - 293.09s |  power grids are in their wind, which means that nations are constantly exporting and importing
293.09s - 298.21s |  power to each other. And power grid regulators have made agreements, blah, blah, blah. What
298.21s - 303.81s |  that means is that if you take down Germany, you're probably going to take down France. You're
303.81s - 309.49s |  probably going to take down Spain, probably the whole continent. So, yeah, that doesn't sound good
309.49s - 318.13s |  to pretty much anyone. This is a practical solar power supply during the eclipse in Germany and how
318.13s - 324.77s |  it was theoretically proven with some math I don't really understand that if you take down
324.77s - 331.57s |  enough solar panels, you are going to take down the power grid for enough time. Again, mathematical
331.57s - 338.29s |  models. I'm a simpleton. I don't understand what they're doing. But it says that at least Germany
338.29s - 345.97s |  and France, as far as I know, cover 35 to 50% of its power using only PV installations, which means
345.97s - 352.77s |  if you take them down, they would have huge problems. Horuscenario had several CVs on one
353.65s - 359.89s |  inverter, SMA. They changed them for RCE. They RCE on those devices, and they interfere with
359.89s - 367.55s |  the devices to destabilize the grid. What we are going to see today, we are going to see
368.43s - 374.35s |  Horuscenario on steroids. We, unfortunately, we're not going to get any CVs because everything is
374.35s - 381.39s |  going to be done with APIs. Cloud doesn't give you any CVs. You know that. We don't need any
381.39s - 387.31s |  physical access. We don't need to be nearby. We can be in our beach house in Greece while hacking
387.31s - 394.99s |  PVs. We could brick and munch. We're inverter agnostic because we are just using the cloud,
394.99s - 402.30s |  and we're looking at more or less a little bit over 500 gigabit hours. Quick intro on my tool
402.30s - 408.62s |  set. Deer Search, Burpsuit, ZXD compiler, APK Lab I.O., which unfortunately is no longer working,
409.42s - 413.98s |  one small droplet on DigitalOcean, Sudan I.O. so that I could find more people,
414.54s - 422.99s |  and basic web application penetration testing. Steps that I was doing, I followed,
423.79s - 429.31s |  I tried to find a demo account. If I couldn't find a demo account, I'd register a new account.
429.31s - 435.31s |  I would find obvious, and I mean really obvious, web issues. I try to control devices by exploiting
435.31s - 441.87s |  those obvious issues, and I would really want to hack Tesla 2004 because he kicked my son's
442.59s - 450.99s |  fortnight. My results, SolrMan, Sunsync, Solax, Growad, Ingecom, Foxes, everyone,
450.99s - 457.79s |  Platform Admin, SolrMan, I couldn't upgrade the firmware. The other thing is, I don't know who
457.79s - 463.79s |  of you are a researcher in here, but you're going to get a lot of those ads. So if you are researching
463.79s - 468.99s |  for PVs, you're going to get a lot of PV ads. If you are researching for, I don't know, sex toys,
468.99s - 474.27s |  you're going to get a lot of ads for sex toys, and this goes to all your house, so yeah,
474.27s - 482.82s |  not a great thing. The disclosure was a train wreck. I have been trying for the past three and
482.82s - 490.18s |  a half years to disclose. Only one and a half vendors responded and acted on the disclosure.
490.18s - 496.02s |  The disclosure had everything that they needed to do. I tried really, really hard to get any
496.02s - 501.30s |  reaction. I emailed, I tweeted, I called them on their phone. I couldn't do anything else other
501.30s - 509.94s |  than drive there and talk to them, but that's not feasible, I guess. Okay. The responses.
509.94s - 515.46s |  SolrMan fixed in five days. Sunsync responded after three years. It's no longer no response.
515.46s - 521.78s |  After my OWASP talk, they did respond and try to fix it. Solax autoresponded. They responded
521.86s - 528.50s |  to their DMs, and then they went, well, Growad asked me where I'm from, because that makes sense,
529.30s - 537.46s |  and Injecon didn't do anything. So I know you're here for the zero days. I'm not legally allowed
537.46s - 542.66s |  to release the zero days, but I can talk about them, and if you have common sense, you can find
542.66s - 549.38s |  pretty much everything. What's the plan? I really want them to fix it, really. I just want to act
549.38s - 555.30s |  on it and fix it. I want to prove that you can control gigawatts of power effectively,
555.30s - 563.30s |  destabilizing country power grids, help avoiding global outages, and I don't know, make the whole
563.30s - 571.54s |  world a safer place, I guess. What did I find? EIDR, RCE, broken authentication, broken
571.54s - 582.16s |  authorization, EIDR, EIDR, EIDR. What did I get? Lots, and I mean lots, I mean couple of million,
582.16s - 588.56s |  couple of tens of million of personal data, access to administrative accounts and panel,
588.56s - 596.61s |  ways to manipulate and break panels, access to internal networks. You can see how many gigawatts
596.61s - 604.69s |  you could control from their panels. I'm not going to list them, and yeah, I know there are more
605.57s - 613.73s |  clouds, but yeah, I couldn't hack some of them, and also my wife didn't allow me to buy any more
613.73s - 624.98s |  inverters because, I don't know, reasons. Solarman, pretty huge player, EIDR on the user add
624.98s - 629.94s |  functionality, I could add a user with any privilege on any group, groups and organizations
629.94s - 635.62s |  were consecutive integers, which means I could pretty much add the user to every group with
635.62s - 643.78s |  admin privileges. What did I get? Full functionality, potential GDPR violation, I love that I should say
643.78s - 649.54s |  potential because I didn't get it, but this was GDPR violation with lacking user and company data,
649.54s - 656.34s |  information on plants and power generated. Really good response, they fixed it in five days,
656.34s - 664.74s |  they chased for verification, so all in all, good for them. Sunsync is probably one of the biggest
664.74s - 671.46s |  players, you don't know them because they're white label, so yeah, you might, if you have FPV,
671.46s - 676.42s |  you might have this back end, but with another label in front, and their issues were,
680.42s - 684.66s |  there was missing the whole point of authorization altogether.
686.82s - 691.70s |  If you're taking pictures, take that picture because you're gonna see that slide a lot for a
691.70s - 698.02s |  lot of platforms. Full functionality of the application, again, potential GDPR violation
698.02s - 703.46s |  because we are not violating the GDPR, information on plants, interact with the plants,
703.46s - 707.38s |  firmware update, because who doesn't want a firmware update on everyone,
707.38s - 715.06s |  backdoor to the network, platform admin. That's all the gateways, you can see we're looking at
715.06s - 723.30s |  half a million gateways, and that's all the firmwares, so you could just upload the firmware
723.30s - 732.06s |  and do whatever you want with that. The disclosure, but I want to say that
732.06s - 739.26s |  after my OWASP talk, their CISO reached out and he was pretty furious that my emails,
739.26s - 744.86s |  phones and everything else didn't reach to him, he was pretty cool, they said they fixed it.
746.94s - 753.42s |  They did not. I reached out last week and told them that I'm gonna say that, and he said no,
753.42s - 757.98s |  we fixed them, so yeah, you do what you want with that information.
758.86s - 768.58s |  Grobat is probably the biggest, and I mean the biggest player in there. I wasn't allowed to buy
768.58s - 778.26s |  a Grobat device because it was like 5k and my wife told me that you're not allowed to spend 5k for
778.74s - 786.02s |  research, so I had to Google some serials and then me being me, I'm doing that, I don't need it,
786.66s - 795.22s |  I find some broken one for 200 euros, so I bought it and then I had full functionality on everything.
795.22s - 800.50s |  What was the vulnerability? I don't know, pretty much everything, they didn't check anything,
800.50s - 805.46s |  so full functionality of the application, potential GDPR violation, interact with the
805.46s - 811.06s |  plants, firmware update on gateway, back to the network, platform admin, all in all, you know,
811.70s - 819.70s |  terrible shit. How did the disclosure go? Dear customer, due to the spring festive holidays,
819.70s - 826.18s |  we can reply in time, thanks for your understanding. That was January 26th of
826.98s - 835.70s |  2022. They do have a lot of spring festive holidays in China, I guess.
837.30s - 842.90s |  Would you please advise which country you're from? Because it makes sense, if I'm from Greece,
842.90s - 847.70s |  they shouldn't fix it, but if I'm from, I don't know, the States, it should. And then while I
847.70s - 854.74s |  was researching, I also found out. Three years later, Grobat vulnerability disclosure policy,
854.74s - 861.46s |  Grobat takes product security very seriously and is committed to protecting our users and their data.
862.58s - 869.46s |  You know what? Fuck off Grobat. Grow a pair, respond to the disclosure emails and do something.
869.46s - 876.42s |  They're the same thing, they didn't respond, they can go do a thing, I don't know. Solax
876.98s - 883.62s |  is the fifth bigger or fourth there in the fifth, one of the five biggest
884.18s - 888.18s |  providers in there. They were pretty good. And I mean, pretty good.
890.58s - 898.90s |  They had only one either, but that either was really, really good. So when you were editing
898.90s - 909.06s |  your user, you were also passing your user level. So when you see user level user, you usually end
909.06s - 915.70s |  up writing, I don't know, user level administrator, user level super administrator or user level root.
915.70s - 923.54s |  So remember that slide? Full functionality, potential GDPR violation, information,
923.54s - 928.50s |  interact with the plans, firmware update, backdoor to the network, platform admin.
928.50s - 932.82s |  You're going to see it a little bit more. Sorry about that. Sorry for repeating, but they're all shit.
935.06s - 942.66s |  Yeah, that's 21,000 pages of installations. You can do the multiplication. That's a lot,
942.66s - 952.05s |  and I mean a lot of devices. That's some EV chargers that they're still not there, but
952.05s - 958.93s |  you can see the demo in there because I'm admin, as I said. Thank you for conducting Solax cloud
958.93s - 965.41s |  support. We are extremely busy at the moment, and that moment has taken them three years.
966.93s - 972.37s |  They're going to respond to me. Then I was starting calling. They didn't answer my calls.
972.37s - 980.05s |  Finally, I just tweeted because it's Twitter, not X, fuck Elon Musk. And I just tweeted,
980.05s - 985.49s |  can someone tell me what I should do with Solax? Then they said that. So is there a problem with
985.49s - 990.77s |  that? Can you tell us what the issue is? I told them, yeah, I sent an email to that, that, that,
990.77s - 996.37s |  that, and that. Let me check. That was their answer. If you can see, I don't know if it's
996.37s - 1002.77s |  possible, that's 2023. So they're either checking really hard or they're just ignoring me.
1003.73s - 1012.77s |  Again, Solax, not cool. In GECON, there's MOLIS, so just 30,000 or 40,000 installation.
1014.93s - 1020.45s |  They're based in Spain or Italy. I don't remember. Sorry about that. They were missing the basic
1020.45s - 1027.49s |  concept of authorization. All IDs were consecutive integers. And again, full functionality,
1027.49s - 1032.77s |  potential GDPR, interact with the plants, firmware update, backdoor, platform admin.
1032.77s - 1040.45s |  Sorry for repeating myself, but they're shit. So you can see that we can also see the RAM,
1040.45s - 1046.69s |  the storage, and there is a really, really small button at the top. Can you see it? It says
1046.69s - 1057.14s |  sell. So you can just click on there and get a sale on each device. Again, you can also do,
1057.14s - 1065.30s |  I don't know, reports, stop it. And you could also disable all their protections, which means
1065.30s - 1073.78s |  that if you were someone who wants to do harm, you could make that thing be on fire. You could
1073.78s - 1091.42s |  literally burn shit up remotely. Does anyone want to guess how the disclosure went? I called them
1092.14s - 1098.38s |  and they just dropped the phone on me. When I said I want to do a vulnerability disclosure,
1098.38s - 1103.34s |  I just heard the toot, toot, toot. They could also say fuck you, but okay.
1104.62s - 1112.54s |  Foxes is the last one. These have only been around my disclosure for six months. So yeah,
1112.54s - 1121.18s |  it's way above my 90 days, but yeah, still not good. They were pretty good too. They had
1121.18s - 1130.61s |  only one issue. Their password reset was not that good. So they had, I don't know,
1130.61s - 1136.85s |  most of the Chinese companies nowadays have a password reset that says, we send you a four
1136.85s - 1143.81s |  digit pin. That pin was brute forcible and the user ID was consecutive integers, which means
1143.81s - 1149.09s |  you could pretty much reset everyone's password with a Python script with for loop.
1150.93s - 1156.45s |  Same thing. Sorry about that. Full functionality, Yada, Indirect, firmware update,
1156.45s - 1163.65s |  backdoor to the network, platform admin, you name it, they have it. Again, anyone want to
1163.65s - 1175.66s |  guess the disclosure? So enough with the photovoltaic. Let's go to EV chargers.
1176.62s - 1187.90s |  Uh, just a reminder. We are not after the power grid. We're after a guy who is named Tesla 2004.
1187.90s - 1195.50s |  He does probably doesn't own a panel, but he or his mom has a Tesla. So let's go up after some
1195.50s - 1205.01s |  EV charges, right? Project TV, 2000 installation in the UK. Growat based again, department of
1205.01s - 1212.61s |  transport approved. That's in the UK. Growat and Shenzhen are China based companies. Can you see
1213.81s - 1223.36s |  the issue in this request? Anyone? No, it's not an either. You would wish it was an either.
1224.96s - 1230.16s |  There is no authentication at all. So you were authenticating on the application. You were
1230.16s - 1235.76s |  saying, yeah, I'm demo with a demo password. And then all the other requests didn't have
1235.76s - 1241.04s |  any kind of authentication, any kind of JWT or cookies. They were just doing, yeah, he said he
1241.04s - 1246.64s |  was that. Let's go with our lives. Fully lacking authentication. Check for a valid combination.
1246.64s - 1252.32s |  Only once on login. Charger IDs were consecutive numbers, so it could be easily, and I mean really
1252.32s - 1260.66s |  easily brute forced. Yeah. Full functionality, lock and lock, remote, backdoor, brick all the
1260.66s - 1268.98s |  devices, platform admin. Disclosure. Oh, my lovely disclosure. Did not respond for weeks.
1268.98s - 1274.34s |  Only responded when I had to reach out to BBC. Eventually fixed after a failed first attempt.
1274.34s - 1279.78s |  You really don't want to have to resend the message and say, yeah, you know that fixed.
1279.78s - 1285.54s |  That's not actually fixed, so you have to try harder. They have a stateless login or whatever
1285.54s - 1294.74s |  the fuck that means. I'm not going to test it anymore. Also, do you remember the Grobat PV?
1294.74s - 1301.86s |  They have the same thing. They just fixed it for the EV. I don't know why. I don't know.
1301.86s - 1312.42s |  EV box, pretty big on the market. They have around 400,000 charging points. They're based in Amsterdam.
1312.42s - 1318.50s |  They were acquired by ENCE. They were really, really, really good. They had a pretty solid API.
1321.47s - 1334.64s |  Want to guess? Let's play a guess game. What's the issue in here? No one? Come on. It says when you
1334.64s - 1342.32s |  update your user, you are also passing your role. Why would I pass my role? So let's try admin,
1342.40s - 1349.52s |  account owner, and then admin, because I also want the fucking server. I just don't want only
1350.16s - 1357.68s |  the EV chargers, which means I had access to pretty much everything. Total compromises,
1357.68s - 1362.80s |  everything, potential GDPR violation, full admin functionality, which means I could give money,
1362.80s - 1369.04s |  I could charge back, I could do financial shit. It was really, really bad. But
1369.44s - 1375.28s |  they responded in just two hours. They fixed it in 24 hours, double checked that everything was
1375.28s - 1384.30s |  fixed. Excellent response. I'm happy when I see this kind of responses. Oh, my lovely wallbox.
1384.30s - 1391.50s |  I don't know how many of you are familiar with EVs. I personally got that banned in the UK,
1392.06s - 1397.74s |  so they probably hate me. So 200,000 users, they're based in Barcelona,
1398.70s - 1404.78s |  merged with Kensington, and their aim to raise 300 million USD. Probably not because they're
1404.78s - 1413.26s |  banned now. I had a second level IDOR, anything in the request body was not validated. I had found
1413.26s - 1419.42s |  four different instances on this in the API, which means I found something, they fixed it,
1419.42s - 1424.94s |  then I went to something else and said, fix that too. And then I said, I'm not doing a free
1424.94s - 1432.46s |  penetration test for you. Fix your shit. Check your proper authentication. Total control over
1432.46s - 1439.82s |  all chargers. Lock and lock. No way to update firmware. Potential GDPR violation. Unfortunately,
1439.82s - 1447.15s |  no platform admin. So they responded the next day. They fixed it in a couple of days.
1447.15s - 1454.27s |  They re-engaged after a month. I found a second issue. They fixed it in a couple of days again.
1454.27s - 1458.99s |  Then they wanted to engage to provide the site of their new hardware platform,
1458.99s - 1466.83s |  which meant I had to sign an NDA and not talk about it, which, no thanks. I don't do NDAs.
1467.71s - 1475.79s |  And then, as I said, charger pool amid warnings, hackers could attack national grid. So yeah,
1475.79s - 1485.12s |  we're getting there. Kudos to the UK government. I think that's the last of the private ones.
1485.36s - 1490.56s |  EoCharger, EoHub, it was the first charger in the UK. It had a lot, and I mean a lot,
1490.56s - 1497.12s |  of teething problems. It had around 15,000 users estimated, and it's a fucking Raspberry Pi,
1499.41s - 1506.13s |  which can be easily rooted. It had no bootloader security, and I was able to recover,
1506.13s - 1513.25s |  not only me, my good friend who is now not with us, Mike Polidoro, the full source code,
1514.21s - 1517.33s |  and I mean two Python scripts because that was their source code,
1519.09s - 1524.37s |  with hard-coded credentials and full documentation. Okay, let me show you something in there.
1524.93s - 1547.84s |  It means you could potentially full decryption, total control, you could mimic the server
1547.84s - 1554.24s |  communication, you can make the devices be part of a botnet, potential GDPR violation,
1554.96s - 1562.05s |  credentials leakage, and platform admin. They tried. I'm not going to be
1563.49s - 1568.61s |  bad with them. They responded in a timely function. They worked hard into reworking pretty
1568.61s - 1575.49s |  much everything, and then they introduced their new and improved Eo Mini, which was still a
1575.49s - 1585.94s |  Raspberry Pi. So all in all, they tried at least. My personal opinion, take it with a pinch of salt
1585.94s - 1593.38s |  because I'm not a hardware expert. Raspberry Pi are a valid prototyping device, but not good
1593.38s - 1598.66s |  to put into production. They're easily extracted all their data. They're easily routable, and
1598.66s - 1606.42s |  there's no secure bootloader. Last one, and we should be off. Public chargers. I have looked
1606.42s - 1611.22s |  after ChargePoint, which is an American electric vehicle. It's one of the top three public
1611.22s - 1616.74s |  chargers providers in the world. A good friend told me that when someone says he's one of the
1616.74s - 1627.74s |  top three, he's the third. They went public in 2021, and they had a publicly exposed unauthenticated
1627.74s - 1634.46s |  GraphQL endpoint with introspection enabled. It was potentially leaking their full schema,
1634.46s - 1639.50s |  and no authentication parameters were to be seen. So you could pretty much do whatever you want,
1639.50s - 1650.19s |  but CMA and crime alert. API research is really, really, really tricky on that. Never, ever
1650.19s - 1657.23s |  interact with a device that you don't own. If you mistakenly do it, notify the vendor immediately
1657.23s - 1662.27s |  and stop doing whatever you are doing because you don't want to end up in jail. At least I don't
1662.27s - 1669.23s |  want to end up in jail. They responded in an hour. They fixed it in the same day. Excellent response.
1670.11s - 1676.91s |  They acknowledged the issue. I could have checked further, but as I said, my goal is to stay outside
1676.91s - 1688.26s |  of prison. So yeah, that was probably a wise choice. For your takeaways, go with a provider
1688.26s - 1695.46s |  that will act on problems. So no random white labels. Try to isolate IoT devices on their own
1696.26s - 1702.58s |  villains. Vulnerabilities will happen and expect them to happen. Also, just a heads up. If your
1703.14s - 1710.82s |  device will be on fire, your private villain will not really help. So take that under consideration.
1710.82s - 1717.62s |  And for those being vendors, know that authorization is not equal to authentication.
1718.34s - 1721.86s |  Push to market cannot always be the excuse. I understand that you have to
1722.58s - 1727.94s |  rush to market because you are a startup, but after you are in the market for five years,
1727.94s - 1735.30s |  you have to secure your seat or you will end up in one of your really bad lists. And pen test
1735.30s - 1744.69s |  your things. Not by me. By anyone. Do try to secure yourself. That was me. Thank you.
