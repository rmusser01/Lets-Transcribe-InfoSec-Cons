 Thanks for your patience, thanks for your interest in this talk today.
4.00s - 8.00s |  My colleagues and I, Sarah, Bernhard and I, my name is Julia,
8.00s - 12.00s |  we will talk about a project that we made together, a joint project,
12.00s - 16.00s |  and we actually created a runoff of a prototype together.
16.00s - 20.00s |  Since Fabult is a hydropower energy supplier in Austria,
20.00s - 28.64s |  actually, especially in the field of renewable energy,
28.64s - 32.64s |  like hydropower, solar power and wind power,
32.64s - 36.64s |  I just want to say a few words about Enviso.
36.64s - 42.64s |  Yes, hi everybody. Enviso is a security consulting company from Europe.
42.64s - 47.64s |  We are mainly focused on the financial and technology sector,
47.64s - 51.64s |  and also the governmental and critical infrastructures.
51.64s - 54.64s |  I want to use the moment, since this was a team effort,
54.64s - 56.64s |  to give a shout-out to a few people.
56.64s - 63.64s |  Great thanks to Alex, Moritz, Olaf, Nicolas, Vanessa and Patrick.
63.64s - 65.64s |  Thanks, Sarah.
65.64s - 67.64s |  As I said, it's about a prototype that we built,
67.64s - 71.64s |  or specifically Enviso did a lot of the creating process.
71.64s - 75.64s |  We chose a runoff river power plant, hydropower plant,
75.64s - 81.64s |  to visualize the effects of a cyber attack on such a plant.
81.64s - 84.64s |  It's not only a visual awareness tool,
84.64s - 87.64s |  it's also supposed to be a forensic training tool.
87.64s - 91.64s |  So what also is included in this ICS firing range...
91.64s - 96.64s |  Attention, attention, everyone. Welcome to DC Next Gen.
96.64s - 100.64s |  I hope you can still hear me.
100.64s - 105.64s |  In fact, we really tried to also include a forensic training
105.64s - 109.64s |  in the ICS firing range that has more than, I think, 10 modules,
109.64s - 113.64s |  I think it's 15, and Bernhard will get into that a bit later,
113.64s - 116.64s |  but you can really investigate a forensic training
116.64s - 123.27s |  in how the cyber attack on a runoff river power plant worked.
123.27s - 127.78s |  Motivation and project idea.
127.78s - 128.78s |  Thank you.
128.78s - 131.78s |  So what was the motivation for two companies like us
131.78s - 133.78s |  to create such a prototype?
133.78s - 137.78s |  So for Verbrugt, it was especially that we are critical infrastructure.
137.78s - 140.78s |  We are a really large power supplier in Austria,
140.78s - 145.78s |  so of course OT cybersecurity is one of our biggest priorities.
145.78s - 148.78s |  And since all of us three are from this section,
148.78s - 152.78s |  we really wanted to do an innovative project together.
152.78s - 157.78s |  And what actually is also one of the most motivational parts
157.78s - 160.78s |  for this project was that Verbrugt is planning to build
160.78s - 164.78s |  a really big cybersecurity range focused on OT in Austria,
164.78s - 168.78s |  in Styria, at a local site of a plant,
168.78s - 172.78s |  and we really want to get all the OT specialists there from Verbrugt,
172.78s - 174.78s |  but also externals, to train there
174.78s - 177.78s |  and to get their cybersecurity knowledge up.
177.78s - 180.78s |  So first we wanted to have a prototype
180.78s - 183.78s |  before we really build a really big cyber range.
183.78s - 188.78s |  That was one of the great motivations towards when to get into that.
188.78s - 193.78s |  So our main motivation is to strengthen the security resilience
193.78s - 198.78s |  of our customers by building realistic attack scenarios
199.78s - 203.78s |  that represent actual OT cyber threats.
203.78s - 205.78s |  So Verbrugt is using Red Team assessments,
205.78s - 213.78s |  or as in this case, we're building a realistic training scenario for Verbrugt.
213.78s - 216.78s |  Different OT environments face different challenges,
216.78s - 220.78s |  therefore it was very important for us to create a tailored training approach
220.78s - 225.78s |  that actually fit the requirements previously described by Julia.
225.78s - 229.78s |  Having a visual and practical approach like in the cyber range
243.73s - 247.73s |  can help to make things more tangible and therefore to raise awareness.
257.73s - 260.73s |  And finally, if you look at the current OT threat landscape,
260.73s - 263.73s |  you can see that the things are getting worse,
263.73s - 266.73s |  therefore it's even more important to have proper training capabilities at hand
266.73s - 272.73s |  to increase the detection and response readiness of the people
272.73s - 275.73s |  that actually have to deal with cyber incidents on site.
277.73s - 278.73s |  Thanks, Sarah.
278.73s - 280.73s |  So as we said, let's summarize it.
280.73s - 283.73s |  Two things were the main objectives for this project.
283.73s - 288.73s |  It's awareness building for people who may only know a little bit about cybersecurity,
288.73s - 291.73s |  but also forensic training for specialists in the field.
292.73s - 297.34s |  Next slide, please.
297.34s - 300.34s |  So what is really important to us, as I told you,
300.34s - 303.34s |  us three are from the field of OT cybersecurity,
303.34s - 305.34s |  so we're not in the operational field.
305.34s - 309.34s |  We're not working directly in a power plant,
309.34s - 312.34s |  so we need to include the knowledge from internal colleagues
312.34s - 315.34s |  but also from manufacturers to gain really a good understanding
315.34s - 322.34s |  of how an ICS fire range could look like an abstracted model of a hydropower plant,
322.34s - 327.34s |  since it's not exactly a realistic one, but as close as possible.
327.34s - 332.34s |  And one of the really biggest inputs that we received from internal colleagues was,
332.34s - 338.34s |  of course, as we have, I think Verbund has already over 130 power plants in Austria,
338.34s - 343.34s |  we really need to have a control room where all the data comes together
343.34s - 346.34s |  and everyone can monetize the data that comes here
346.34s - 350.34s |  and see if everything's all right in the plant itself.
350.34s - 356.34s |  And we realized this kind of control room within an HMI on the ICS fire range
356.34s - 359.34s |  where you can also control the range in itself,
359.34s - 362.34s |  and you see all the measured data from the power plant,
362.34s - 366.34s |  and you can also give an input as to, say, control the wares,
366.34s - 370.34s |  that is also included in this prototype, but also, for example,
370.34s - 373.34s |  you can raise the water levels.
373.34s - 378.34s |  And, yeah, so that was one of the main important inputs that our people gave us,
378.34s - 386.34s |  and we really tried to include it to make it as real as possible.
386.34s - 397.90s |  Next, I want to give you some hard facts about the ICS firing range.
397.90s - 401.90s |  As you can see, the project had a duration of around one year.
401.90s - 406.90s |  One of the challenges was that our team is in Austria, Bernhard and my team,
406.90s - 408.90s |  but Enviso is in Germany.
408.90s - 411.90s |  I think most of them were in Frankfurt, and we were in Vienna.
411.90s - 414.90s |  So, of course, we had quite a big span,
414.90s - 418.90s |  and many or actually all of our meetings were remote meetings.
418.90s - 420.90s |  So that's also a challenge.
420.90s - 423.90s |  Bernhard will get into the challenges later a bit,
423.90s - 428.90s |  but it's not so easy since we could not get together and build on it together.
428.90s - 430.90s |  But I think it still worked really well,
430.90s - 436.90s |  and what I also think is really cool is that we had a lot of people in this project.
436.90s - 439.90s |  So now you're just seeing us three, but as Sarah mentioned at the beginning,
439.90s - 441.90s |  it was really a team effort.
441.90s - 443.90s |  We had over 30 people involved.
443.90s - 447.90s |  We had students from the university in Vienna, the technical university in Vienna,
447.90s - 450.90s |  who really programmed the cyber attack for us,
450.90s - 454.90s |  and Enviso did the part of going into the construction.
454.90s - 456.90s |  And that's why I want to give the mic to Sarah,
456.90s - 462.90s |  because she will get into the construction and logical construction part now for you.
462.90s - 464.90s |  Yeah, thank you, Julia.
464.90s - 466.90s |  So now we're getting into the more technical part.
466.90s - 470.90s |  So as you could see in the previous slide, the cyber range consists of two layers.
470.90s - 475.90s |  So on top, which is the slide that you can see now, is the scenario and visualization layer.
475.90s - 482.90s |  Below that, we have the electric cabinet with all the technical components inside.
482.90s - 490.90s |  The scenario and visualization layer has at first the modulated hydro power plant.
490.90s - 492.90s |  So we have a river, of course.
492.90s - 493.90s |  We have head and tail water.
493.90s - 496.90s |  We have a turbine building, and we have the wheels.
496.90s - 502.90s |  So we have one twin wheel for the normal operations, and we have one emergency wheel.
502.90s - 507.90s |  Since you cannot look into this little building, to make things more tangible,
507.90s - 515.90s |  we also added the HMI to the cyber range, and also a model of the turbine,
515.90s - 521.90s |  including the shutters that actually control the water flow that hits the turbine.
521.90s - 523.90s |  Next slide, please.
523.90s - 526.90s |  Now you can see the electric cabinet.
526.90s - 531.90s |  Here we have at first a few basic components, as, for example, power supply
531.90s - 534.90s |  and general safety and controlling equipment.
534.90s - 541.90s |  So on the upper left, we have the contactor and electronic circuit breaker that handle electric faults.
541.90s - 549.90s |  Additionally, we have the PSUs that provide 5, 12, or 24 volts to the different components of the cyber range.
549.90s - 555.90s |  And below that, we have the terminal blocks that are used for the distribution of the power.
555.90s - 563.90s |  The heart of our cyber range is a network of programmable logic controllers and Raspberry Pis
563.90s - 569.90s |  that are orchestrated to emulate electromechanical and hydraulic processes.
569.90s - 575.90s |  These PLCs are the decision-making brain of our firing range.
575.90s - 583.90s |  To make a realistic scenario, we actually implemented commonly used PLCs,
583.90s - 587.90s |  specifically the Siemens Seachem A8000.
587.90s - 591.90s |  The Raspberry Pis serve as remote IOs for these PLCs.
591.90s - 599.90s |  And in the little box on the right bottom, you can see there are the IO drivers for the Raspberry Pi
599.90s - 602.90s |  to actually drive the stepper motors of the wheels.
602.90s - 606.90s |  Above that, in the upper right corner, you have the Siemens BoxPC.
606.90s - 610.90s |  And the Siemens BoxPC is used to drive the HMI.
610.90s - 612.90s |  So please, next slide.
612.90s - 614.90s |  So tying it all together, how does this work?
614.90s - 616.90s |  What is the logic of the cyber range?
616.90s - 623.90s |  So as I mentioned before, we have the PLCs and the Raspberry Pis that are connected via Modbus.
623.90s - 628.90s |  We have the HMI that is connected via S7 COM with the PLCs.
628.90s - 634.90s |  And the sensors and actuators are connected via I2C and GPIOs with the Raspberry Pis.
634.90s - 640.90s |  If I talk about sensors here, then I mean the opening level sensors for the wheels
640.90s - 642.90s |  and also the shutters of the turbine.
642.90s - 645.90s |  Okay, you may have recognized this.
645.90s - 648.90s |  We have a hydroelectric power plant, but we don't have water at the moment.
648.90s - 650.90s |  So that's actually bad.
650.90s - 652.90s |  So maybe there's something missing.
652.90s - 657.90s |  If you want to create a model including real water, this is always kind of error-prone.
657.90s - 661.90s |  We have a lot of electric here, so we decided to go a different approach.
661.90s - 667.90s |  For this, we added a simulation layer to the logic of the cyber range.
667.90s - 670.90s |  In this simulation layer, we have a simulation program.
670.90s - 678.90s |  And this program actually emulates the water level of the headwater of the power plant.
678.90s - 685.90s |  In combination with the actual data, so the sensor data retrieved from the Raspberry Pi,
685.90s - 693.90s |  this program calculates the new water levels and publishes these water levels to the MQTT broker.
693.90s - 697.90s |  The Raspberry Pi's MQTT client is then subscribed to these values,
697.90s - 703.90s |  so it retrieves all the updates of the new water levels and forwards these water levels to the PLCs.
703.90s - 704.90s |  Okay, nice.
704.90s - 706.90s |  Now we have water, but still only in logic.
706.90s - 710.90s |  So you can still see no water on our model.
710.90s - 716.90s |  Okay, so another step is necessary, and therefore we added another machine, the visualization machine.
716.90s - 724.90s |  The visualization machine is basically a projector that is tied on top of our model.
724.90s - 726.90s |  Please, next slide.
726.90s - 731.90s |  There you can see in the middle picture, you can see the projector that is on top of our model.
732.90s - 744.90s |  In combination with our thin client, they also consume the water levels from the MQTT broker and project them on the model.
744.90s - 746.90s |  How did we do this?
746.90s - 755.90s |  To actually create the images for the water, there is a Unity game running that contains that surface structure,
755.90s - 758.90s |  represents the surface structure of our range.
758.90s - 761.90s |  Additionally, we have a blue layer in this Unity game,
761.90s - 767.90s |  and its height is increased and decreased as needed to represent our water levels.
767.90s - 768.90s |  Okay, nice.
768.90s - 777.90s |  Now we have a working power plant, but to actually create training scenarios for this cyber range,
777.90s - 779.90s |  we also need network infrastructure.
779.90s - 782.90s |  Please go to the next slide.
782.90s - 786.90s |  The network infrastructure for the firing range is also split up into two parts.
786.90s - 789.90s |  We have the IT and the OT network.
789.90s - 796.90s |  The IT network hosts multiple virtual machines that emulate a classic office environment.
796.90s - 801.90s |  The IT network is completely virtualized.
801.90s - 805.90s |  The OT network contains two networks, a virtual and a physical one.
805.90s - 814.90s |  The physical one hosts the PLCs, and the virtual one hosts a virtualized active directory.
814.90s - 815.90s |  Okay, nice.
815.90s - 819.90s |  You can actually start implementing attacks here in our cyber range.
819.90s - 826.90s |  If you look at the current OT incidents, then you can see that actually a lot of OT incidents start in IT.
826.90s - 829.90s |  That is also the case for our attack scenario.
829.90s - 835.90s |  A very classic one, the attacker sends a phishing mail to the victim,
835.90s - 842.90s |  which urges the victim to download an executable from an attacker-controlled web server.
842.90s - 845.90s |  This executable, surprise, contains an SITU implant,
845.90s - 850.90s |  and after execution, the attacker has an initial foothold in the IT network.
850.90s - 857.90s |  Further, poorly configured workstation security allows the attacker to dump credentials,
857.90s - 861.90s |  escalate privileges, and finally move laterally
861.90s - 865.90s |  and compromise the jump host and the control technology DMC.
865.90s - 867.90s |  So, actually very bad.
867.90s - 868.90s |  Why is this bad?
868.90s - 872.90s |  Well, the jump host and the control technology DMC is used to manage the PLCs.
872.90s - 877.90s |  So, it's used to reprogram the PLCs in absolutely a place
877.90s - 881.90s |  where you do not want to have unauthorized personnel.
881.90s - 883.90s |  But it's even getting worse.
883.90s - 887.90s |  So, the attacker starts enumeration of the network, dumps the active directory,
887.90s - 894.90s |  and further analyzes which servers are accessible with the currently owned privileges.
894.90s - 898.90s |  Unfortunately for the power plant and fortunately for the attacker,
898.90s - 903.90s |  he is able to access the Nextcloud datastore.
903.90s - 906.90s |  So, what is the Nextcloud datastore and why is this bad?
906.90s - 910.90s |  Well, the Nextcloud datastore is used to host the project files for the PLCs.
910.90s - 914.90s |  So, that's actually very valuable information for the attacker
914.90s - 918.90s |  since the project files contain the logic of the PLCs.
918.90s - 921.90s |  And, well, the PLCs control the power plant.
921.90s - 923.90s |  So, not too nice.
923.90s - 929.90s |  The attacker is happy, is exfiltrating these files via the previously established C2 channel,
929.90s - 935.90s |  analyzes it, modifies it, and re-uploads the files to the Nextcloud datastore.
935.90s - 939.90s |  And what happens next and why this is a problem, Bernhard will tell you.
941.90s - 946.90s |  At the next stage, as an OT operator, I took the project file,
946.90s - 949.90s |  deployed it on my PLCs, and the horror is starting.
949.90s - 955.90s |  So, immense flood is running over the water power plant and also the environment.
957.90s - 958.90s |  Next slide.
959.90s - 961.90s |  Training and DFIR.
961.90s - 967.90s |  We have separated into 15 labs, which are separated in three main parts.
967.90s - 969.90s |  The first main part is the analyzing part.
969.90s - 974.90s |  The second part is see how an attacker is working on the environment
974.90s - 977.90s |  and which tools they are using normally.
977.90s - 981.90s |  And also, we use OS typical forensic parts.
981.90s - 987.90s |  So, we will show the people who are working on a water power plant what can we see,
987.90s - 992.90s |  what is a security engineer seeing, and what can he see in real life.
993.90s - 998.90s |  And also, we get into deeper of the Siemens toolbox,
998.90s - 1001.90s |  which we use to program the logical units.
1002.90s - 1007.90s |  And we also do the analyzation of the files from the toolbox.
1008.90s - 1012.94s |  Next slide.
1020.89s - 1021.89s |  The lessons learned.
1022.89s - 1029.89s |  These are the heavy part because the ICS fire range is a bit bulky and heavy.
1029.89s - 1034.89s |  We heard before it's a lot of weight and a lot of metal in it.
1034.89s - 1039.89s |  Also, the most important part is to create easy to use
1039.89s - 1043.89s |  and also good resilient backup and restore solution.
1043.89s - 1048.89s |  Because if we do some trainings, we should be really fast in restoring
1048.89s - 1054.89s |  and deploying and backuping the situation where we can do the live trainings on it.
1054.89s - 1060.89s |  So, it took us a long time to create consistent ESXi backups
1060.89s - 1065.89s |  in combination with the graphics and also the Raspberry configuration.
1066.89s - 1067.89s |  The noise.
1067.89s - 1072.89s |  Noise is really important because it's not the best choice to take the first switch,
1072.89s - 1074.89s |  which you have in your depot.
1074.89s - 1079.89s |  Normally, we have a Cisco catalyst switch from an old environment.
1079.89s - 1082.89s |  So, it was really noisy. It was active-cooled.
1082.89s - 1085.89s |  So, we changed the switch to a passive-cooled switch.
1085.89s - 1091.89s |  So, everyone who is trying such a project, use as most as you can passive components
1091.89s - 1093.89s |  because there are some really loud.
1094.89s - 1095.89s |  Model building.
1095.89s - 1098.89s |  Yeah, model building is not a technique.
1098.89s - 1100.89s |  It's also a bit of art.
1100.89s - 1105.89s |  So, you had to design the mountains and you had to design the cars and so on.
1105.89s - 1107.89s |  So, a typical Austrian environment.
1108.89s - 1112.89s |  The PCAP size during the analysis and for the training is also important
1112.89s - 1118.89s |  because not everyone is happy to handle a lot of gigabytes from PCAP files
1118.89s - 1122.89s |  and this is the next part to analyze them with Tshark.
1124.89s - 1127.89s |  Normally, in the security, we use Tshark,
1127.89s - 1131.89s |  but not every OT operator is familiar with Tshark.
1131.89s - 1137.89s |  So, we had to switch to Wireshark, which is more convenient for everybody to use.
1138.89s - 1141.89s |  And yeah, so that's all.
1146.26s - 1151.26s |  For the toolbox, what is happening in the second part of the file,
1151.26s - 1156.26s |  because the attacker is manipulating the toolbox file,
1156.26s - 1165.26s |  the toolbox file, the new one, is displaying the target values as the real values.
1165.26s - 1174.26s |  So, the target values will show on the HMI and seems to the operator everything is fine.
1174.26s - 1179.26s |  And on the other side, the toolbox is sending zeros to the wires.
1179.26s - 1185.26s |  So, the wires will not function at the moment during the attack.
1185.26s - 1188.26s |  And this is why the flood starts.
1188.26s - 1192.26s |  And the problem is normally you have the HMI,
1192.26s - 1197.26s |  the operator which is working on the HMI is not directly connected
1197.26s - 1200.26s |  or has no visual view to the water power plant.
1200.26s - 1205.26s |  And then, yeah, that's all for now.
1207.26s - 1210.26s |  Are there any questions so far?
1210.26s - 1216.26s |  Because we also have a short video where you can see what happens.
1227.40s - 1229.40s |  This is a short overview.
1229.40s - 1232.40s |  Here you see the top of the wires and the mountains.
1233.40s - 1235.40s |  I had to cheat a little bit.
1237.40s - 1239.40s |  Yeah, here are the mountains.
1239.40s - 1249.40s |  So, we created a typical Austria environment to make it more home feeling for the students.
1249.40s - 1252.40s |  Here are the wires which are 3D printed.
1252.40s - 1258.78s |  This is the landscape which is getting flooded.
1261.09s - 1265.09s |  In the back, you can see the turbine which is a Kaplan turbine.
1265.09s - 1269.09s |  So, it's also realistic to create.
1269.09s - 1273.09s |  It's also important to create a realistic Kaplan turbine.
1273.09s - 1278.74s |  On the left top, you see the HMI.
1278.74s - 1284.24s |  And here is the ICS component.
1284.24s - 1294.24s |  So, here you can see the Siemens ICS, the P8000 and also the Siemens computer.
1294.24s - 1307.82s |  So, we used everything or we tried to make the model as near as a real water power plant.
1307.82s - 1311.82s |  So, normally, Siemens component will be used in this environment.
1316.73s - 1318.73s |  Yeah, this is mobile.
1318.73s - 1332.42s |  So, you can bring it from point A to B.
1332.42s - 1339.23s |  Yeah, so, are there any questions so far?
1339.23s - 1341.23s |  Okay.
1341.23s - 1347.49s |  Then, thank you.
1347.49s - 1352.49s |  And as I see that there are some people waving, feel free to contact us and chat with us about the range.
1352.49s - 1357.49s |  And we can give you a bit more details than just the 25 minutes that we have here.
1357.49s - 1359.49s |  Thank you.
