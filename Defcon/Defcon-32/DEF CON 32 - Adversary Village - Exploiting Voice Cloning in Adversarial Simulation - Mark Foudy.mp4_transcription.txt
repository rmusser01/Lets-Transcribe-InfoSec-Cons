 Hello, my name is Mark Foody,
2.20s - 3.20s |  and my presentation is called
3.20s - 6.92s |  Exploiting Voice Cloning and Adversarial Simulation.
6.92s - 8.76s |  I'd first like to thank Adversary Village
8.76s - 11.04s |  for giving me the opportunity to present my research
11.04s - 13.44s |  at DEF CON 32, and it's an honor to be here
13.44s - 15.96s |  among so many talented individuals.
15.96s - 17.36s |  Okay, so let's dive in.
17.36s - 18.20s |  Who am I?
19.48s - 21.24s |  As I mentioned, my name is Mark.
21.24s - 22.48s |  I wear many hats.
22.48s - 24.36s |  I'm an offensive security researcher,
24.36s - 27.72s |  a father, a husband, a proud cat dad.
27.72s - 30.96s |  In addition to my work in AI and security,
30.96s - 33.12s |  I founded Neurodiverse Hackers,
33.12s - 34.68s |  which is a community dedicated to highlighting
34.68s - 36.44s |  and addressing the unique needs
36.44s - 39.32s |  of neurodiverse individuals in the hacking community.
39.32s - 40.96s |  Now let's get to the heart of today's presentation.
40.96s - 42.64s |  We're gonna explore the fascinating
42.64s - 44.56s |  and unsettling world of voice cloning.
45.52s - 50.04s |  So initially I had planned on demonstrating
50.04s - 52.76s |  how easy voice verification systems could be bypassed,
52.76s - 54.24s |  but due to the legal gray areas
54.24s - 56.80s |  concerning using a real-time voice clone
56.84s - 58.56s |  to access my own bank account,
58.56s - 60.96s |  I decided to focus on showing how cloned speech
60.96s - 65.80s |  could be made undetectable to anti-spoofing mechanisms.
65.80s - 66.88s |  While many commercial products
66.88s - 68.40s |  can create realistic voice clones,
68.40s - 71.44s |  they cannot defeat the voice verification services
71.44s - 72.76s |  used by financial institutions,
72.76s - 76.64s |  which detect anomalies through mouse spectrograms.
76.64s - 78.64s |  To bypass anti-spoofing components,
78.64s - 79.96s |  it's crucial to refine a voice model
79.96s - 81.52s |  through the steps I'll present.
82.52s - 86.79s |  So voice verification services
86.79s - 88.83s |  are provided by companies like Nuance,
88.83s - 90.79s |  Variant, Fortress Identity.
90.79s - 92.43s |  They're used by financial institutions
92.43s - 95.31s |  such as Fidelity Bank, Wells Fargo,
95.31s - 97.67s |  Citibank for secure authentication.
98.99s - 100.47s |  Although these services enhance security
100.47s - 101.75s |  through voice biometrics,
101.75s - 104.15s |  they remain vulnerable to exploitation.
104.15s - 106.03s |  Today I'll discuss the methods
106.03s - 107.87s |  used to bypass these technologies
107.87s - 110.15s |  and focus on adversarial training required
110.15s - 112.75s |  to enable a voice clone model to bypass anti-spoofing
113.31s - 114.55s |  verification systems.
116.23s - 118.39s |  The purpose of this talk is not to delve
118.39s - 120.31s |  into the voice cloning process itself,
120.31s - 122.51s |  but to explore how adversarial training
122.51s - 124.79s |  can create a voice clone indistinguishable
124.79s - 126.43s |  from natural human speech.
126.43s - 127.95s |  So I'll walk through the eight key elements
127.95s - 130.71s |  that can make a synthetic voice practically imperceptible
130.71s - 132.47s |  from the real one, from a real one.
141.30s - 143.42s |  To thematically organize my various approaches
143.42s - 144.74s |  for defeating voice verification,
144.74s - 147.02s |  I developed the acoustic standards
147.02s - 149.14s |  for modifying spoof speech.
149.18s - 150.86s |  This is like a set of standards focused
150.86s - 152.98s |  on key aspects of audio manipulation,
152.98s - 154.86s |  making spoof speech indistinguishable
154.86s - 156.82s |  to voice verification.
156.82s - 159.90s |  Each step in acoustics provides a structured approach
159.90s - 162.74s |  to bypass the rigorous verification
162.74s - 165.50s |  and streamlining the process used by other researchers
165.50s - 167.66s |  to enter like accessible status steps
167.66s - 168.90s |  that anyone could follow.
170.02s - 171.74s |  In planning these techniques requires
171.74s - 173.78s |  a combining signal processing
173.78s - 175.30s |  and machine learning algorithms.
175.30s - 177.50s |  So after DEF CON, I will provide code examples
177.50s - 179.34s |  and slides on GitHub to demonstrate
179.34s - 180.98s |  how these adjustments can be made
180.98s - 184.34s |  and automated and used to train a voice clone model.
184.34s - 185.18s |  Let's delve in.
186.34s - 188.34s |  All right, so slide one, acoustic.
188.34s - 191.98s |  So in all your spoofing adjusting silence intervals
191.98s - 193.42s |  is crucial for creating speech
193.42s - 196.34s |  that convincingly mimics genuine human interaction.
196.34s - 199.66s |  Natural communication includes pauses
199.66s - 201.78s |  and starts at the end of speech.
201.78s - 204.34s |  These are known as leading and trailing silences,
204.34s - 205.74s |  which can carry acoustic signatures
205.74s - 207.90s |  like microphone static, breathing sounds
207.90s - 209.74s |  and other ambient noise.
209.74s - 213.22s |  These nuances are vital for making speech sound authentic.
213.22s - 215.54s |  So the first task in adjusting silence intervals
215.54s - 218.10s |  involves replacing the leading and trailing silence
218.10s - 221.22s |  with natural silences extracted from genuine recordings.
221.22s - 222.90s |  This requires selecting silences
222.90s - 225.50s |  that match the context of the spoof speech
225.50s - 227.42s |  and ensuring they exhibit natural variability
227.42s - 230.06s |  and align with the intended environment.
230.06s - 232.54s |  Along with replacing leading and trailing silence,
232.54s - 233.74s |  it's also essential to eliminate
233.74s - 235.38s |  inward redundant silence.
236.66s - 240.30s |  Spoof speech often has a longer synthetic pauses
240.30s - 241.78s |  due to its segmented nature
241.78s - 244.26s |  of the speech synthesis process.
244.26s - 245.62s |  The goal is to reduce these gaps
245.62s - 247.50s |  by inserting human-like silences
247.50s - 249.98s |  that maintain the rhythm and flow of authentic speech
249.98s - 251.38s |  using advanced algorithms
251.38s - 253.22s |  to model natural silence patterns.
256.94s - 261.54s |  So then center spectrum boosting.
261.54s - 264.26s |  Center spectrum boosting is also a critical technique
264.26s - 265.82s |  for enhancing spoof speech
265.82s - 267.94s |  because it manipulates frequency components
267.94s - 269.70s |  to increase perceived authenticity.
270.62s - 273.18s |  Human speech has like an energy concentration
273.18s - 274.66s |  in the low to mid frequency range,
274.66s - 277.26s |  particularly between one and four kilohertz,
277.26s - 278.82s |  which is vital for intelligibility
278.82s - 281.02s |  and contains the most phonetic information.
282.34s - 284.26s |  Boosting these central frequencies
284.26s - 286.18s |  makes synthetic speech sound more natural
286.18s - 287.50s |  and less mechanical,
287.50s - 290.02s |  and it's helping it blend seamlessly
290.02s - 291.78s |  into real world audio environments.
292.78s - 294.90s |  Natural speech's mid-range frequencies
294.90s - 296.98s |  contribute to clarity and distinguish human voices
296.98s - 298.22s |  from synthetic ones.
299.26s - 301.70s |  Many audio classifiers and voice verification systems
301.70s - 304.06s |  detect subtle clues within this range
304.06s - 306.58s |  to differentiate genuine from spoof speech.
306.58s - 309.98s |  So making center spectrum manipulation
309.98s - 312.74s |  essential for overcoming synthetic speech limitations.
313.98s - 315.50s |  Digital signal processing techniques
315.50s - 316.98s |  amplify critical frequencies
317.90s - 320.06s |  while suppressing higher frequencies
320.06s - 321.94s |  and enhancing the signal's intensity
321.94s - 323.18s |  within a targeted range.
324.98s - 327.18s |  Careful calibration ensures that the amplification
327.18s - 333.71s |  maintains authenticity and avoids distortions.
333.71s - 336.75s |  All right, oh, optimizing echo simulation.
337.75s - 339.43s |  Optimizing echo simulation is crucial
339.43s - 342.51s |  for making synthetic speech more convincing and realistic.
342.51s - 345.19s |  Echoes naturally occur when a speech is recorded,
345.19s - 348.59s |  adding depth and context by reflecting off surfaces.
348.59s - 350.07s |  These reflections help listeners
350.07s - 351.83s |  perceive space and authenticity,
351.83s - 353.23s |  often missing in synthetic voice
353.23s - 355.55s |  generated by spoofing algorithms.
355.55s - 357.99s |  And the genuine recording echoes of subtle clues
357.99s - 360.39s |  that aid in interpreting the recording space,
360.39s - 361.75s |  size, and nature,
361.75s - 363.23s |  and they vary in amplitude and delay
363.23s - 365.91s |  based upon the surface distance and characteristics.
366.75s - 369.23s |  To enhance the realism of spoof speech,
369.23s - 370.75s |  simulating natural echo patterns
370.75s - 372.91s |  involves introducing slight time delay
372.91s - 374.67s |  with copies of the original audio
374.67s - 376.83s |  with progressively lower amplitudes.
376.83s - 378.71s |  This mimics how sound waves will bounce
378.71s - 380.87s |  and decay in real world environments,
380.91s - 382.91s |  and it's enhancing the audio's spatial qualities
382.91s - 385.19s |  and challenging voice verification systems
385.19s - 387.43s |  to detect the absence of natural reflections.
392.46s - 395.06s |  All right, so you, upgrade frequency pre-emphasis.
395.94s - 397.98s |  While center spectrum boosting
397.98s - 400.14s |  focused on enhancing the naturalness of synthetic speech
400.14s - 402.02s |  by amplifying mid-ranges,
402.02s - 405.18s |  frequency pre-emphasis targets the higher frequency ranges
405.18s - 408.06s |  to improve speech quality and reduce noise.
408.06s - 409.50s |  Pre-emphasis involves boosting
409.50s - 411.06s |  the amplitude of higher frequencies,
411.06s - 413.26s |  typically between one and six kilohertz,
413.26s - 414.82s |  which are less prominent in natural speech
414.82s - 418.34s |  but critical for enhancing clarity of intelligibility.
419.74s - 421.42s |  The primary goal of frequency pre-emphasis
421.42s - 424.54s |  is to adjust the frequency profile of synthetic speech
424.54s - 427.90s |  so that it aligns more closely with natural human speech.
427.90s - 429.82s |  By applying pre-emphasis filters,
429.82s - 431.38s |  we can emphasize higher frequencies
431.38s - 433.42s |  to match synthetic characteristics
433.42s - 435.46s |  and maintain a natural spectral balance.
436.86s - 438.70s |  This process reduces noise impact
438.70s - 441.34s |  and makes the speech sound more realistic and robust.
442.26s - 445.06s |  So through careful calibration,
445.06s - 448.30s |  pre-emphasis ensures speech retains its tonal quality
448.30s - 449.54s |  without a distortion,
449.54s - 452.26s |  making it more challenging for voice verification system
452.26s - 454.02s |  to detect any anomalies.
457.37s - 460.29s |  All right, S is spectral noise reduction.
460.29s - 461.73s |  Spectral noise reduction is crucial
461.73s - 463.25s |  for enhancing smooth speech
463.25s - 466.69s |  by removing unwanted noise artifacts
466.69s - 468.89s |  that reveal its synthetic quality.
469.73s - 471.41s |  While natural speech includes
471.41s - 473.41s |  subtle random background noise,
473.41s - 475.81s |  smooth speech often contains distinct machine noise
475.81s - 478.69s |  due to the synthesis limitations.
479.65s - 481.21s |  Managing noise in the audio signal
481.21s - 482.85s |  improves the perceived authenticity,
482.85s - 483.93s |  making it more challenging
483.93s - 486.37s |  for detection system to identify.
487.21s - 488.09s |  The goal is to eliminate
488.09s - 489.73s |  or minimize machine-generated noise
489.73s - 492.57s |  that can serve as a cue for voice verification systems
492.57s - 494.17s |  to reject the speeches cloned.
495.77s - 497.57s |  To align the noise profile of smooth speech
497.57s - 498.93s |  with natural human speech,
498.93s - 500.49s |  we use a three-step strategy.
500.49s - 503.13s |  First, we use spectral gain filtering,
503.13s - 504.17s |  which filters out the noise
504.17s - 506.41s |  by analyzing frequency components
506.41s - 508.53s |  and removing those below a set threshold.
509.89s - 511.81s |  Then we use dynamic noise filtering,
511.81s - 513.53s |  which uses adaptive algorithms
513.53s - 516.65s |  to adjust in real time to the audio environment,
516.65s - 519.37s |  ensuring that a continuous noise reduction.
519.37s - 522.17s |  And finally, through context-appropriate additive noise,
522.17s - 524.41s |  such as ambient office or outdoor sounds,
524.41s - 525.61s |  which is incorporated,
525.61s - 528.57s |  it will often use to mask synthetic artifacts
528.57s - 530.57s |  to create more natural-sounding speech.
538.50s - 540.98s |  Tuning adversarial speaker regularization.
540.98s - 543.30s |  So tuning adversarial speaker regularization
543.30s - 544.98s |  is a sophisticated technique
544.98s - 548.90s |  used to make synthetic speech sound
548.90s - 550.86s |  as if it was produced by a real speaker,
550.86s - 552.02s |  masking any artifacts
552.02s - 555.82s |  that could reveal its artificial origins.
555.82s - 558.42s |  This is achieved by using adversarial methods,
558.42s - 560.50s |  often with machine learning models,
560.50s - 561.90s |  to refine speech signal
561.90s - 564.02s |  so that it closely matches the vocal characteristics
564.02s - 565.14s |  of a target speaker.
566.66s - 568.10s |  By employing adversarial techniques,
568.10s - 569.42s |  we can adjust the speech signal
569.42s - 570.98s |  to align with the natural variability
570.98s - 573.54s |  and dynamism of human speech,
573.54s - 576.50s |  reducing the likelihood for it being flagged as synthetic.
577.54s - 579.30s |  So to enhance speech authenticity,
579.30s - 581.94s |  our strategy involves three steps.
581.94s - 583.74s |  First, we use adversarial training
583.74s - 585.98s |  with the generative adversarial networks
585.98s - 589.18s |  to iteratively refine audio quality,
589.18s - 591.42s |  allowing the generator to produce realistic samples
591.94s - 594.58s |  while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity.
595.86s - 597.46s |  Second, we engrave the unique voice print
597.46s - 599.26s |  of the target speaker onto the spoof audio
599.26s - 603.10s |  by adjusting a prosodity pitch and timbre,
603.10s - 605.90s |  and which will match the genuine speaker's vocal,
605.90s - 609.02s |  which matches the genuine speaker's vocal characteristics.
609.02s - 612.38s |  Finally, regularization techniques smooth irregularities
612.38s - 614.26s |  and speech signal ensuring consistent tone
614.26s - 615.78s |  and clarity through the audio.
620.06s - 623.02s |  All right, I, integrate additive noise.
623.06s - 624.78s |  Integrating additive noise is crucial
624.78s - 627.30s |  for enhancing authenticity of spoof speech.
627.30s - 629.54s |  Natural speech often includes background noises,
629.54s - 631.02s |  added depth and context,
631.02s - 634.58s |  while spoof speech typically sounds too clean and artificial.
634.58s - 635.94s |  By strategically adding noise,
635.94s - 637.46s |  synthetic speech can blend seamlessly
637.46s - 638.94s |  into real world environments,
638.94s - 640.38s |  increasing its believability.
641.46s - 643.18s |  Additive noise makes synthetic qualities
643.18s - 644.86s |  by introducing natural variations
644.86s - 647.70s |  and imperfections present in real recordings.
647.70s - 650.46s |  It also helps disguise any artifacts or inconsistencies
650.46s - 653.46s |  from the synthesis process,
653.46s - 656.14s |  making spoof speech sound more realistic.
657.82s - 659.62s |  To create a realistic audio environment,
659.62s - 663.62s |  we follow, we can do three steps to do that.
663.62s - 665.34s |  First, we select noises sources
665.34s - 667.30s |  that are contextually appropriate,
667.30s - 669.90s |  and such as typing sounds for an office setting
669.90s - 671.50s |  or wind or traffic noise.
672.38s - 674.86s |  Second, we use algorithms to dynamically adjust
674.86s - 677.26s |  the level and type of the noise that we're using,
677.26s - 678.54s |  ensuring that it complements the speech
678.54s - 679.74s |  without overwhelming it.
680.58s - 683.18s |  Finally, we maintain temporal and spatial consistency
683.18s - 686.14s |  by aligning the noise with the speech's rhythm and flow,
686.14s - 687.62s |  carefully timing its introduction
687.62s - 689.74s |  and adjusting spatial characteristics
689.74s - 695.53s |  to match the perceived environment.
695.53s - 698.49s |  And C, we create model agnostic approach.
698.49s - 700.17s |  Creating a model agnostic approach
700.17s - 702.61s |  is essential for enhancing spoof speech,
702.61s - 704.89s |  ensuring that the techniques that use to generate
704.89s - 706.37s |  or modify speech are not tied
706.37s - 709.17s |  to any specific voice verification system
709.17s - 711.29s |  or machine learning model.
711.29s - 714.17s |  This approach provides flexibility and adaptability,
715.01s - 717.21s |  allowing for the development of spoof methods
717.21s - 718.29s |  that can effectively bypass
718.29s - 720.33s |  a wide range of detection systems,
720.33s - 723.49s |  regardless of the underlying algorithms or architecture.
725.09s - 728.61s |  By focusing on techniques that are universally applicable,
728.61s - 731.85s |  a model agnostic strategy exploits general weaknesses
731.85s - 733.61s |  and speech processing to create
733.61s - 735.21s |  a more convincing spoofed audio,
736.65s - 739.25s |  which is crucial as voice verification systems
739.25s - 740.21s |  continue to evolve.
741.73s - 743.85s |  To enhance audio manipulation,
744.53s - 745.57s |  we develop generalizable techniques
745.57s - 748.89s |  that address common vulnerabilities across systems.
748.89s - 751.33s |  And we focus on manipulating silence intervals,
751.33s - 753.81s |  frequency emphasis, and noise integration
753.81s - 756.61s |  based on fundamental speech processing principles.
758.57s - 760.49s |  Then second, we create a flexible framework
760.49s - 762.45s |  that allows easy adaptability
762.45s - 764.13s |  and testing on various techniques
764.13s - 766.73s |  using modular design principles for component
766.73s - 770.33s |  and algorithm intercompatibility.
770.33s - 772.97s |  Finally, we implement machine learning models
772.97s - 774.89s |  that learn from diverse verification systems,
774.89s - 777.29s |  training on generalized features and patterns
777.29s - 779.17s |  to ensure adaptability and effectiveness
779.17s - 780.53s |  across different platforms.
782.74s - 786.37s |  All right.
786.37s - 788.37s |  As we conclude our exploration of acoustic standards,
788.37s - 789.93s |  it's evident that each element is crucial
789.93s - 792.65s |  in refining the authenticity of spoofed speech.
792.65s - 794.49s |  These techniques provide insight into the weaknesses
794.49s - 796.97s |  that can be exploited in voice verification systems
796.97s - 800.13s |  and highlight the areas where these systems need to evolve.
800.13s - 801.41s |  For cybersecurity professionals,
801.41s - 804.45s |  understanding these enhancements lays the foundation
804.45s - 806.57s |  for developing more robust defenses
807.25s - 808.25s |  against audio spoofing.
809.37s - 810.69s |  By dissecting the methods used
810.69s - 812.05s |  to create convincing spoofed speech,
812.05s - 814.17s |  cybersecurity experts gain a deeper understanding
814.17s - 816.45s |  of the intricacies of audio manipulation.
817.33s - 818.85s |  This knowledge enables them to anticipate
818.85s - 820.89s |  and counteract emerging threats,
820.89s - 822.21s |  strengthening the security posture
822.21s - 824.41s |  of voice verification systems.
824.41s - 826.89s |  The acoustic standards offer a comprehensive framework
826.89s - 829.73s |  for enhancing the realism of spoofed speech.
829.73s - 832.01s |  By applying these insights,
832.01s - 833.97s |  professionals can devise innovative strategies
833.97s - 836.49s |  to detect and thwart sophisticated spoofing attempts
837.41s - 838.57s |  and build more resilient systems
838.57s - 840.17s |  that withstand these challenges.
841.97s - 843.41s |  As we continue to innovate in this field,
843.41s - 845.45s |  it's essential to prioritize security ethics
845.45s - 847.29s |  and responsibility in the development
847.29s - 849.53s |  and application of these technologies.
849.53s - 850.65s |  Thank you for your attention.
850.65s - 852.09s |  And if you're getting, I welcome any questions
852.09s - 862.30s |  or discussions you may have.
862.30s - 863.14s |  Any questions?
906.59s - 909.35s |  I mean, I think the goal is text-to-speech,
909.35s - 911.07s |  especially from an adversary's perspective.
911.07s - 913.95s |  It's to like get a clone replica of someone's speech
913.95s - 916.31s |  and to be able to bypass like sort of
916.31s - 919.83s |  any verification systems that would prevent access
919.83s - 921.63s |  to like banking records or what have you.
921.63s - 923.55s |  I think both in the sense that,
923.55s - 925.19s |  which I think what you're saying is like,
925.19s - 927.11s |  do we, or is the goal text-to-speech
927.11s - 931.19s |  or is it sort of mining speech samples
931.19s - 932.75s |  from an actual speaker, right?
934.67s - 936.83s |  You have to mine speech samples from a speaker.
936.83s - 939.07s |  Like, so you have to start with, you know,
939.07s - 942.91s |  your clone model and then adding it in like samples
942.91s - 947.91s |  from your target, you know, the degree that you,
948.15s - 952.03s |  the amount of samples you need to like introduce
952.03s - 953.87s |  varies depending on the context,
953.87s - 956.43s |  but you have to start that way, you know,
956.43s - 960.31s |  but implementing these like techniques
960.31s - 962.99s |  like will allow you to sort of like expand that,
962.99s - 965.55s |  you know, so taking a little bit of sample from a target
965.55s - 967.91s |  and being able to create like a realistic voice clone
967.91s - 969.63s |  is possible using these techniques.
969.63s - 988.26s |  So does that answer your question?
988.26s - 989.50s |  I think it's a temporary thing.
989.50s - 991.30s |  I think it's a temporary thing, yep.
991.30s - 992.18s |  Any other questions?
992.18s - 1010.28s |  Please, hi.
1010.28s - 1011.60s |  Yeah, well, absolutely.
1011.60s - 1014.36s |  Yeah, I mean, the question was like,
1014.36s - 1016.84s |  there are AI models that are in the works
1016.84s - 1017.84s |  to create spoof speech,
1017.84s - 1020.72s |  but are there models also being used
1020.72s - 1022.32s |  to defeat voice cloning?
1022.32s - 1025.36s |  And absolutely, I mean, that's sort of the,
1025.36s - 1027.52s |  it's sort of a cat and mouse game in the sense that,
1027.52s - 1031.88s |  in fact, the models that exist to detect spoof speech
1031.88s - 1033.40s |  are probably better in some sense
1033.40s - 1034.84s |  than the models that make clone speech.
1035.72s - 1038.12s |  Like I was saying, the clones,
1038.12s - 1039.48s |  like, you know, when you look on the internet,
1039.48s - 1042.12s |  there's people selling, you know, voice clone technology.
1042.12s - 1045.36s |  None of that stuff that like is advertised
1045.36s - 1048.40s |  or is expected to defeat like the voice biometrics
1048.40s - 1050.76s |  that are necessary, like for like a career criminal
1050.76s - 1052.28s |  or a cyber threat, you know?
1052.28s - 1055.40s |  So the technology is on that side,
1055.40s - 1058.88s |  but these steps that are like, you know,
1058.88s - 1062.08s |  that I've outlined are ways that like focus
1062.08s - 1065.20s |  and attack the ways that those AI speech models
1065.20s - 1068.80s |  like view spoof speech and determine it
1068.80s - 1070.28s |  and sort of distinguish it from real speech.
1070.28s - 1072.48s |  So we're going after the same places
1072.48s - 1074.44s |  that these models were looking at,
1074.44s - 1076.92s |  such as like ambient noise and like, you know,
1076.92s - 1080.20s |  echo and preemphasis and spectral boosting.
1080.20s - 1085.00s |  By addressing those, we make spoof speech much harder
1085.00s - 1086.88s |  to detect from real speech.
1086.88s - 1087.88s |  You know what I mean?
1087.88s - 1089.56s |  So, okay.
1089.56s - 1090.88s |  Any other questions?
1090.88s - 1093.26s |  What's up?
1094.06s - 1096.34s |  Yeah, yeah, yeah, please, please.
1096.34s - 1098.22s |  Okay, just speak to me and I'll follow up.
1098.22s - 1099.46s |  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1099.46s - 1102.18s |  So I've heard from a lot of CEOs that are like,
1102.18s - 1103.50s |  I want you to put AI on it.
1103.50s - 1105.54s |  It needs to be AI, put AI on my company.
1105.54s - 1107.62s |  And voice is obviously one of the options.
1107.62s - 1110.54s |  So given where the technology is now,
1110.54s - 1112.02s |  is that a bad recommendation?
1112.02s - 1114.06s |  Do you think that we shouldn't be using voice cloning?
1114.06s - 1115.38s |  Is it a, is it-
1115.38s - 1116.78s |  Is it voice cloning or voice verification?
1116.78s - 1117.62s |  Yeah, voice verification.
1117.62s - 1120.22s |  Is voice verification a failed technology
1120.22s - 1121.74s |  looking for a problem?
1122.66s - 1124.38s |  Well, I would, I'm a little biased,
1125.22s - 1126.06s |  but I would say so.
1126.06s - 1126.90s |  I mean, I would, you know,
1126.90s - 1128.82s |  my own bank uses voice verification.
1128.82s - 1132.86s |  I mean, I don't know, I'm not a CEO of a company,
1132.86s - 1135.26s |  but I would, voice verification is,
1136.94s - 1141.69s |  I mean, so like using these techniques I talked about,
1141.69s - 1144.69s |  well, you have almost like a 95% like effective rate, right?
1144.69s - 1148.29s |  So, I mean, the voice verification systems will advance,
1148.29s - 1150.33s |  but at the current state they're at now,
1151.37s - 1153.13s |  they are able to be defeated.
1153.85s - 1156.25s |  It just requires a voice clone model
1156.25s - 1158.85s |  that has been trained appropriately to defeat them, right?
1158.85s - 1160.53s |  And that is something that any adversary
1160.53s - 1161.93s |  could figure out, could do, right?
1161.93s - 1165.69s |  I mean, with enough resources, I mean, I can do it.
1165.69s - 1167.17s |  So if they can do it.
1167.17s - 1168.85s |  So yeah, I mean, if I was a CEO,
1168.85s - 1171.21s |  I would find other ways to like, you know,
1171.21s - 1174.73s |  like to secure myself in voice,
1174.73s - 1178.01s |  because I mean, we've already seen in the news other,
1178.01s - 1179.77s |  like a bunch of different situations
1179.77s - 1181.93s |  where this has happened, you know?
1182.29s - 1183.21s |  Yeah.
1183.21s - 1184.37s |  Does that answer your question?
1184.37s - 1185.21s |  Okay.
1185.21s - 1189.10s |  Anybody else, please?
1189.10s - 1189.94s |  Anybody?
1192.66s - 1193.50s |  Are you scared?
1193.50s - 1194.86s |  I'm scared.
1194.86s - 1195.82s |  It's going on GitHub.
1195.82s - 1197.14s |  I'll add the code.
1197.14s - 1199.02s |  I was gonna put the code up, but then I thought, you know,
1199.02s - 1200.42s |  I hate it when people just like throw code
1200.42s - 1202.78s |  and then like, I'll have more like code
1202.78s - 1204.18s |  and more like explanations
1204.18s - 1206.38s |  of how to implement each of these techniques,
1206.38s - 1207.82s |  like each of these standards.
1208.78s - 1211.10s |  But that was, this was a talk that was like,
1211.10s - 1213.38s |  could have been a workshop and I just had to pare it down.
1213.38s - 1217.06s |  And so there's a lot of cutting, like a lot of cutting.
1217.06s - 1219.62s |  So I, but I promised to release that.
1219.62s - 1220.46s |  Okay.
1220.46s - 1221.30s |  Anybody else?
1221.30s - 1222.14s |  Anybody else?
1222.14s - 1225.00s |  What's up?
1225.00s - 1225.84s |  It's all right.
1225.84s - 1226.68s |  No, please do.
1226.68s - 1227.52s |  Come on.
1239.52s - 1241.36s |  It's a great question.
1244.04s - 1244.88s |  It's a great question.
1245.16s - 1246.00s |  That's an awesome question.
1246.00s - 1249.24s |  The question is, it's like a clone speech
1249.24s - 1251.88s |  indistinguishable to the verification system
1251.88s - 1253.56s |  or to a human listener.
1253.56s - 1255.48s |  So that's a really great question.
1255.48s - 1256.44s |  So like, I would say this,
1256.44s - 1260.04s |  like if someone clones my voice and calls my wife,
1260.04s - 1262.00s |  she's probably gonna figure out it's not me
1262.00s - 1263.44s |  because not just my voice,
1263.44s - 1264.92s |  but just sort of the speaking patterns
1264.92s - 1266.12s |  might not be the same.
1266.12s - 1268.72s |  It just might like, just feel not right.
1268.72s - 1273.36s |  And there's situations like some woman had like,
1273.36s - 1274.92s |  somebody had done the same thing with their daughter
1274.92s - 1276.44s |  and they were like, it didn't sound right,
1276.44s - 1278.52s |  but they, it sounded like her, but not like her.
1278.52s - 1281.56s |  So it depends who we're talking about.
1281.56s - 1284.28s |  Like this person works at the bank
1284.28s - 1286.08s |  who relies on the voice verification system
1286.08s - 1287.88s |  to say, yeah, this sounds authentic.
1289.32s - 1290.92s |  That's probably gonna be able to be bypassed.
1290.92s - 1292.56s |  My wife, I mean, gosh, I hope not.
1292.56s - 1293.40s |  You know what I mean?
1293.40s - 1294.88s |  Like it's like, you know what I mean?
1294.88s - 1297.36s |  So yeah, I mean, you know,
1297.36s - 1299.20s |  so when I call my bank, I call it,
1299.20s - 1300.60s |  like I try to like, I just start to,
1300.60s - 1302.84s |  you know, and it's like to try to, you know,
1303.28s - 1304.52s |  voice changes, like, you know,
1304.52s - 1305.64s |  like your voice can change.
1305.64s - 1308.00s |  So it's really like, it's a,
1309.12s - 1310.80s |  it's not like a fingerprint that it's like,
1310.80s - 1311.84s |  it's harder to modify.
1311.84s - 1314.12s |  I mean, you, people's voice changes with age.
1314.12s - 1316.56s |  So yeah.
1316.56s - 1318.24s |  Does that make sense?
1318.24s - 1319.08s |  Yeah, yeah.
1319.08s - 1319.92s |  Yes and no.
1319.92s - 1320.96s |  The context depends.
1320.96s - 1321.80s |  But yeah, yeah.
1322.80s - 1324.08s |  Anybody else?
1324.08s - 1328.66s |  Yeah, what's up?
1328.78s - 1330.74s |  Testing, what are like pretty good
1332.74s - 1333.86s |  tests against them?
1335.66s - 1337.74s |  Yeah, so there's, that's a great question.
1337.74s - 1340.58s |  So there is like open source data sets out there
1340.58s - 1343.42s |  that are used by voice verification systems
1343.42s - 1345.46s |  to sort of refine, train their models on.
1345.46s - 1347.34s |  And they're available, like, you know,
1347.34s - 1350.82s |  there's ASD spoof data sets.
1352.34s - 1354.66s |  There's other ones out there and you can use them.
1354.66s - 1358.42s |  And just like the voice verification companies use them
1359.18s - 1362.18s |  and adversaries can use them also to sort of train on.
1362.18s - 1364.18s |  Is that, so that, you know, that's what,
1364.18s - 1365.02s |  is that your question?
1365.02s - 1369.30s |  Like, and so if I was gonna train them,
1369.30s - 1371.54s |  well, so I would start off by,
1371.54s - 1372.66s |  well, I did, I mean, I trained,
1372.66s - 1375.22s |  I started off by a generalized voice data set.
1375.22s - 1378.22s |  Like there's one, it's like a Linda Johnson,
1378.22s - 1379.30s |  Linda Johnson speech.
1379.30s - 1382.90s |  It's like 30,000 voice samples.
1382.90s - 1384.90s |  And I'd feed that into like my model, right?
1384.90s - 1385.78s |  To start off with.
1385.78s - 1387.90s |  And let it train on that.
1387.90s - 1391.46s |  It took about a week on my own system.
1391.46s - 1394.74s |  And then what I did was I take voice samples of myself,
1394.74s - 1397.02s |  like, which are like maybe a hundred, right?
1397.02s - 1398.90s |  Which are similar to what you could get,
1398.90s - 1400.74s |  let's say on this YouTube video,
1400.74s - 1403.74s |  if someone was to cut my voice into segments, right?
1403.74s - 1407.46s |  And I train it on that and it gets pretty close,
1407.46s - 1409.90s |  but it's not gonna defeat verification
1409.90s - 1413.10s |  unless I address ambient noise.
1413.10s - 1415.82s |  I mean, because the way voice verification works
1415.82s - 1418.50s |  is it takes the digital signal
1418.50s - 1420.70s |  and transfers it into like a male spectrogram.
1420.70s - 1423.34s |  So it's looking at it like in a much different way
1423.34s - 1424.18s |  than we are.
1424.18s - 1427.82s |  And it's looking at for like differences in frequency
1427.82s - 1428.86s |  and like pitch.
1428.86s - 1433.46s |  And it knows which things are common with smooth speech.
1433.46s - 1434.30s |  And so it picks it up.
1434.30s - 1438.90s |  So as long as you can like manipulate the synthetic speech
1438.90s - 1443.90s |  in order to sort of bypass those like target areas,
1444.38s - 1447.38s |  then yeah, it's, I mean, and it's doable.
1447.38s - 1448.82s |  I mean, you know, other people have done it.
1448.82s - 1450.90s |  I mean, APTs can do it, I'm sure.
1450.90s - 1451.74s |  You know what I mean?
1451.74s - 1453.34s |  Like our government can do it, you know?
1453.34s - 1492.20s |  I mean, so what's that?
1492.20s - 1496.04s |  In a sense, that's what, what's that?
1497.40s - 1499.88s |  Okay, I'm being told I have to answer this offline.
1499.88s - 1502.92s |  Yes, that's we, yeah.
1502.92s - 1507.00s |  I guess we're done for time, but do we test it against,
1509.41s - 1513.93s |  sorry, can I answer that afterwards?
1513.93s - 1515.09s |  Because I'm being told we got to stop
1515.09s - 1516.73s |  and it's like, it's a little more deeper question.
1516.73s - 1518.09s |  It's a little more complicated to explain,
1518.09s - 1521.25s |  but yes, the short answer is yes.
1521.25s - 1523.81s |  Okay, we'll just come see me and we'll talk.
1523.81s - 1525.49s |  I'll talk, I'll be here afterwards.
1525.49s - 1526.33s |  I'm not going anywhere.
1526.33s - 1529.77s |  So if anybody's got questions, wanna hang out, chat, talk.
1529.77s - 1530.61s |  I'm cool with it.
1530.61s - 1531.45s |  All right, man.
1531.45s - 1532.77s |  Thank you for coming to my talk, man.
1532.77s - 1533.65s |  Thank you.
