**Introduction to the Talk**
- Welcome to DEF CON and the Creator Stage
- Talks are being recorded and streamed
- Introduction of Dr. Katherine Ullman, author of "The Active Defender"
- The talk will involve both a presentation and a narrative role

**Dr. Katherine Ullman's Background**
- Handle: InvestigatorChick
- University of Buffalo staff for over 24 years

- Passion for sloths, specifically adopted one named Flash

**Forensic Science and Investigation Process**
- **Forensic Science**: Application of science to criminal and civil law
- **Edmund Locard**: Introduced the principle "every contact leaves a trace"
- **Digital Forensics**: Involves digital mediums, like computer crime, and examines digital media for evidence
- **Evidence Handling**: Importance of chain of custody and use of right blockers to preserve evidence integrity

**Digital vs. Traditional Forensics**
- Traditional forensics often destroys evidence during analysis (e.g., DNA, fingerprints)
- Digital forensics requires no alteration of original evidence

**Investigative Process Overview**
- **Scoping Call**: Initial step to gather summary, details, timestamps, and objectives
- **Common Challenges**: Assumptions, unrealistic timeframes, incomplete requests, and improper scope

**Data Gathering and Analysis**
- **Data Gathering**: May involve non-digital data; requires prioritization due to limited time
- **Tools**: FTK Imager, NCASE, Axiom, etc., used for data acquisition and analysis
- **Data Analysis Goals**: Look for scoped indicators, document findings, and ensure timestamps are in UTC

**Challenges in Forensics**
- **Permissions**: Necessary for accessing certain data
- **Tunnel Vision**: Avoiding narrow focus that may overlook relevant evidence
- **Tools**: Ensuring the right tools are available for analysis

**Case Study: Alice and Bob**
- Investigation of Bob's murder with Alice as a suspect
- Analysis of digital communication, fingerprints, and physical evidence
- Revelation of Charlie Cyber's involvement and drug dealings

- Emphasizes understanding offensive tactics for effective defense
- Personal anecdote on transitioning from the music industry to digital forensics

**Q&A Highlights**
