 Perfect. All right and with that Michael's gonna talk to you about eradicating hepatitis C with
4.88s - 20.99s |  bioterrorism. So one more round of applause for Michael. I don't know who needs to hear this
24.02s - 34.02s |  but I'm scared too. All the time of losing the health that I have. I know what it feels like.
35.30s - 42.18s |  I know what it feels like to not know what's wrong with your body and to have to go shop for a
42.18s - 50.02s |  stranger who has the authority to maybe or maybe not give you what you need. I know what it feels
50.02s - 55.62s |  like to know what's wrong with your body and to know what you need and to be told you can't have
55.62s - 62.18s |  it because the infrastructure has failed and it's not available. I know what it feels like to be
62.18s - 68.10s |  told that you can't get it because it's not legal in the place where you are. I know what it feels
68.10s - 75.38s |  like to be told that you can't have it because the doctor doesn't share your opinion.
77.22s - 84.10s |  And perhaps worst of all I know what it's like to be told you can have it only to realize
85.22s - 96.77s |  that you can't afford it. I know this happened to you. It never should have occurred. This is wrong
97.33s - 113.86s |  and I hope to show you all some tools so that it doesn't ever have to happen again. Sorry there
113.86s - 120.82s |  may or may not be some slides but uh what you're about to see is a photograph of me hopefully
121.70s - 130.96s |  but I'll keep talking. The photograph you're about to see you'll notice I looked different then.
130.96s - 141.60s |  I looked different then. I had long hair. I was overseas. Three days later I had no hair
141.60s - 151.20s |  anywhere on my body and three weeks later I had all new skin and I decided to be magnanimous and
151.20s - 164.08s |  not show you how it came off but it was rough and it was ugly. Then there's another picture.
164.80s - 173.47s |  I'm recovering in a hospital. I have an IV in my hand. A tumor had just been removed from my body.
175.74s - 184.56s |  This was the first picture. Is it up? You guys see it? Here I am three days later. Here I am
184.56s - 196.27s |  three weeks later. Here I am in the hospital. Well somewhere I'm in the hospital and they'd
196.27s - 203.47s |  removed a tumor from my body that was invisible on the MRI and the only reason it got removed is
203.47s - 214.34s |  because I insisted on it. There's another picture of me in the hospital. I can see my slides. Sorry
214.34s - 219.46s |  guys. I don't know if it's still getting a black screen but it's all right. There's another picture
219.46s - 226.18s |  of me recovering in the same hospital because I had to have another operation also under general
226.18s - 246.46s |  anesthesia just to prepare for the other surgery. Now the important thing to note and what I'm
246.46s - 256.46s |  trying to impart here is that most medications you can make a better cheaper version of yourself
256.46s - 267.18s |  at home. Anybody can. It's entirely doable. Now if the slides won't come up for whatever reason
267.18s - 274.35s |  I'll talk through it but there are a handful of tools that you need to go through this.
275.23s - 282.35s |  The first thing that you need to do is you need some chemistry. Now most people kind of cower.
283.31s - 288.51s |  Chemistry seems hard. It seems like a specialized thing. Well sure if you're doing research chemistry
288.51s - 295.87s |  yeah that's why there's a PhD in it of course but if you just need to operate it similar to
295.87s - 301.15s |  the difference between building a computer and using a computer it's significantly easier.
303.23s - 308.91s |  It says a lot about the state of humanity when we develop all of these things and don't
308.91s - 315.15s |  deliver them. Sorry I just got to bounce back this slide too. This is so important. Those research
315.15s - 319.31s |  chemists that are doing biochemistry, they're doing medicine, they're doing incredibly important
319.31s - 324.99s |  things. It's amazing. It's amazing. It's so sophisticated and yeah there's a reason that
324.99s - 332.35s |  they get PhDs in it but if all you're trying to do is pirate something that's doable and it can
332.35s - 344.19s |  be automated. I believe this. That's why I'm here. Hacking is important for the world. It saves lives.
344.19s - 350.43s |  All of you know this. You've seen it. This is just a little more direct. It can happen with anything.
350.43s - 355.39s |  You take something and you use it for a purpose for which it was not intended so that you are
355.39s - 361.31s |  no longer gatekept against access. This is why we do what we do and I know you all understand this.
366.13s - 370.77s |  Knowledge belongs to all of humanity. I believe this with every fiber of my being.
371.49s - 375.73s |  There have been moments in history where economics and morality have come to a head
375.73s - 383.17s |  and the economists have said you can't have that. I'm sorry it's not moral.
384.45s - 389.65s |  It's the way our economy works and the moralists have come back and said that's not good enough.
390.69s - 395.73s |  It happened in this country with slavery. People said people can't be property. That is not
395.73s - 400.37s |  acceptable and the economists said yes it's really unfortunate and it's kind of old but
401.33s - 407.49s |  that's how our economy runs and the moralists came back and said that's not good enough and
407.49s - 414.29s |  similarly today people are dying every day because of intellectual property law making it so that
414.29s - 420.69s |  people do not have access to the medicines they need and the economists say oh I know it's an old
420.69s - 424.29s |  system. I know it's being abused. It's kind of unfortunate but there are trillions of dollars
424.29s - 429.81s |  circling the world. We can't just pull the rug out from under that and there are some of us
431.01s - 445.34s |  who are saying that's not good enough. I know you all believe in the right to repair. I do too.
446.30s - 452.86s |  I believe in the right to repair for your body and this is not a new idea. It used to be that
452.86s - 458.38s |  everybody was involved in their own health. The notion that you can't manage your own health
458.38s - 464.70s |  is fairly new. Gates have been put up saying you can't do this. You're practicing medicine without
464.70s - 470.14s |  a license. You're not allowed but if you come to the authority we'll sell it back to you.
472.45s - 478.05s |  Not acceptable. You need to become involved in your own health. You can't just follow doctor's
478.05s - 484.69s |  orders. It's not good enough anymore. I don't know if it ever was. We know that this is not an excuse
484.69s - 491.81s |  in wartime. Why is it still an excuse when you're dealing with your health? It shouldn't be.
494.14s - 501.90s |  I'm gonna say this again. You can make most medicines yourself at home and you can make them
501.90s - 511.02s |  better. I'm not kidding. Better and cheaper. Now we're gonna have to look at how. I want to do a
511.02s - 518.46s |  quick poll here. How many people know somebody who owns a cat who is also either immunocompromised
518.46s - 525.98s |  or pregnant? Show of hands real quick. Yeah. Okay. A couple. Next. How many people know somebody who
525.98s - 530.86s |  has an allergy that sends them into anaphylactic shock? Oh yeah. Plenty. Okay. Cool.
532.78s - 536.06s |  How many people know somebody who has hepatitis C?
537.02s - 546.22s |  Alright. Couple. Alright. I'm gonna remember you. How many people have a uterus and are
546.22s - 557.54s |  child free by choice? Cool. Alright. Fewer than I thought. But alright. Who remembers this guy?
559.14s - 565.78s |  This is Martin Shkreli. And what you're seeing right now is him lying to Congress. He was CEO
566.26s - 572.10s |  of Turing Pharmaceuticals. And what he was lying about was the pricing structure of daraprim,
572.10s - 582.58s |  pyrimethamine, an anti-toxoplasmosis drug. It had been $13.50 a pill and he changed the price to $750
582.58s - 593.36s |  a pill. If you calculate this out, a full course of treatment is just south of $19,000. This is
593.36s - 601.28s |  his phone number. I called him from stage at Hope in 2016. He didn't answer but he called me back a
601.28s - 608.72s |  few hours later. Of course he got hauled off to prison a while after that. Here's what we did.
608.72s - 614.24s |  We took exception to this. We found a new synthesis pathway. It had one step fewer,
614.24s - 619.84s |  it was much more efficient, there were greater margins of error and there was greater purity
619.84s - 625.52s |  in yield. So we made some. Here I am at that same conference throwing pills to the audience that
625.52s - 633.84s |  cost me a quarter to make each. And you can make these things too. Making pills is easy. If you
633.84s - 640.64s |  have active pharmaceutical ingredient, just pack it into caplets. Measure it out. Everybody can
640.64s - 648.24s |  do this. It's not difficult. And here's what a course of treatment looks like. Now, it's amazing
648.24s - 654.72s |  there was so much outrage around what he did and yet the pricing structure still has not changed
654.72s - 662.40s |  but you can make a full course of treatment for $80. Now, who said they knew somebody who had a cat
663.76s - 676.83s |  and was pregnant? You want it? I'll toss it out. Keep that person healthy. Keep that person safe.
677.79s - 689.41s |  More to come. This is Heather Bresch. She is, can you guess, lying to Congress. She was CEO of
689.41s - 696.13s |  Mylan Pharmaceuticals and she was lying about the pricing structure of the EpiPen. I know everybody
696.13s - 705.41s |  remembers this one. It was $60 for a pair. And then she decided it was going to be $604 for a pair.
708.18s - 716.10s |  We presented about this in 2018 and I called her at this number. It might still work. You can try it.
718.58s - 726.99s |  She didn't answer. We decided to make our own version. It's not a complicated thing. You take
726.99s - 733.15s |  an auto-injector that's designed for needle phobic diabetics. You put in a small syringe,
733.15s - 742.27s |  a large needle, and a vial of epinephrine. You can make one too. This cost $30. Additionally,
742.27s - 747.15s |  you can test it to see if it works. And you can reload it for $3. You just need a new needle,
747.15s - 755.18s |  a new syringe, and a new hit of Epi. And again, after all this time, the pricing structure has
755.18s - 762.30s |  not shifted. There is no leverage to change these prices. You can make your own. It's not hard.
763.26s - 767.02s |  Now, who said they had a friend who had anaphylactic shock?
771.18s - 779.02s |  You want it? All right. Here. Pass it back. Keep that person healthy. Keep that person safe.
779.74s - 789.07s |  And make more. It's not hard. And then there was this time that these nine
789.07s - 794.43s |  robed creeps decided they were going to ruin ‑‑ sorry, hang on. And then there was this
794.43s - 800.19s |  time that these nine robed creeps decided they were going to just ruin everything for everyone
800.19s - 805.07s |  by saying you couldn't have the medicine you wanted if you happened to have a uterus.
806.27s - 813.15s |  We thought this wasn't cool either. And at Hope in 2022, we figured out a way to dope business
813.15s - 820.35s |  cards with abortion drugs. It's fairly simple. And you can do it too. Here's all you need.
821.31s - 826.43s |  You get some active pharmaceutical ingredients, some Everclear, a blender, and a pipette.
827.95s - 832.99s |  Then all you do is you put in the Everclear, you put in the powder, you blend it up,
832.99s - 839.87s |  and then you take the pipette and you put six dots on a business card. Here I am two years ago
839.87s - 848.19s |  at Defcon at a house not far from here making about 200 on a table. Here's all you do. You
848.19s - 855.57s |  lay them out. That top one is special edition. You can't get that anymore. You put six dollops
855.57s - 861.73s |  on a card. Those are the three doses that you need to induce an abortion. You let it dry. It
861.73s - 868.13s |  curls up like this. And then you put it in a baggie. It is super simple. Here's the entire
868.13s - 875.81s |  table. And then you bag them up in the morning. And then maybe you put them places. Because it's
875.81s - 886.16s |  just the size of a card, maybe in the family planning section. In a drug store. Or maybe at
886.16s - 892.96s |  your local public library you find an appropriate volume that somebody who might be in need might
892.96s - 900.69s |  find and you just uh just slip it in there. And again, the recipe you just saw is for a hundred
900.77s - 910.05s |  cards. So maybe you even get really creative and decide that another third place that people go to
910.05s - 924.43s |  who might have trouble getting access to these sorts of things. I mean, up to you. The Good
924.43s - 929.71s |  Mocker Institute estimates that it's about $500 if you want an abortion through traditional channels.
930.67s - 936.27s |  If you send away for mifepristone and misoprostol pills it will cost you about $160.
937.23s - 944.27s |  These cards, they cost 89 cents to make, including the printing of the cards and the baggies.
946.19s - 951.63s |  You can afford to make these. And despite all the outrage around all of it,
952.19s - 957.87s |  this pricing structure and the access hasn't shifted much. Now for some of you
958.43s - 965.39s |  who recognize patterns will anticipate the next question which is, who would like my business card?
966.35s - 972.27s |  Who wants this? I'm not going to make assumptions but I think you don't have a uterus. Yeah,
972.27s - 980.69s |  all right. Here, will you pass that back? And there may or may not be a bunch of these stashed
980.69s - 991.63s |  in ladies rooms around. I don't know who put them there. This is hepatitis C. This is what
992.27s - 999.47s |  we're talking about today. This is terrifying and it's not common knowledge. It is more virulent
999.47s - 1006.75s |  than HIV. It is more widespread than HIV and it is more lethal than HIV. And it is a very clever
1006.75s - 1012.67s |  virus. If you want to get into the molecular biology of it, it's incredible. It is awe-inspiring.
1013.55s - 1027.06s |  This is Sovaldi, also known as sofosbuvir. This molecule makes magic happen. It actually goes in
1027.06s - 1033.78s |  and interdicts in the replication process when hepatitis C is trying to make more of it.
1036.91s - 1044.83s |  Here is the enzyme that allows hepatitis C to make more by replicating RNA. And here
1045.71s - 1054.43s |  is Sovaldi inside of the binding pocket doing what one of our chemists referred to as
1055.23s - 1066.14s |  fucking shit up. This is not just a drug that's helpful. This drug will actually eradicate the
1066.14s - 1071.50s |  virus from your body. This is the first time this has ever been done. If you have a virus,
1071.50s - 1076.22s |  either your body manages it or you have to continuously take antivirals for the rest of
1077.02s - 1085.34s |  your life, you can actually be hepatitis C-free with this drug. It's not just a treatment. You
1085.34s - 1094.06s |  take one pill a day for 12 weeks and hepatitis C is gone from your body. What is the catch?
1095.50s - 1103.58s |  These pills cost $1,000 a piece. And for those of you who are good with arithmetic,
1103.58s - 1110.38s |  you will notice that this is $84,000 that it costs. And it will come as no surprise to the
1110.38s - 1114.94s |  Americans in the audience that insurance companies aren't super hot to pay for it.
1117.60s - 1124.11s |  Let's look at how shitty hepatitis is. This is how it's gone the last few years.
1125.87s - 1130.27s |  Two seminal moments I'd like to point out. Here's where Sovaldi was invented.
1131.07s - 1135.95s |  Now, those of you who are familiar with the American medical system and how drugs go
1135.95s - 1140.59s |  will know that it takes a while between invention and approval. And indeed it did.
1140.59s - 1146.03s |  But here's where it was approved. Maybe you noticed something kind of strange about the graph.
1147.31s - 1151.71s |  Let's extend the data just a little bit. And you'll see, taking it up to the current day,
1152.51s - 1160.69s |  it's getting worse, not better. That's worth wondering about.
1160.69s - 1169.41s |  Now, as some of you know, I'm a mathematician. I will not require any of you to do the integral
1169.41s - 1176.53s |  to calculate the area under the curve here as to how many people died since it was invented.
1178.86s - 1186.70s |  It was over 5 million between the invention of Sovaldi and today, all of which could have
1186.70s - 1194.30s |  been avoided if they had merely been given this course of treatment. And I take great
1194.30s - 1204.78s |  exception to that. Right now, almost 1% of the entire world has hepatitis C. It's closer to
1204.78s - 1210.86s |  three quarters of a percent. But look around this room and do a quick back of the envelope.
1211.66s - 1222.37s |  There are plenty of people right here who have it. Plenty unknowingly. Again, it is more virulent
1222.37s - 1230.61s |  and more deadly than HIV. One and a half million people will get it this year. Some probably like,
1230.61s - 1235.49s |  you know, later today if they get lucky. Hopefully it's fun in the process.
1236.37s - 1239.65s |  Over a quarter of a million people will die of hepatitis C this year.
1241.17s - 1248.05s |  A quarter of a million. And somebody dies every two minutes. How long have I been up here?
1249.73s - 1254.13s |  When I talked about this five years ago, it was every three minutes. So again,
1254.13s - 1258.93s |  not only is it getting worse, but it's getting worse faster. Now,
1260.37s - 1263.89s |  usually when I start throwing these sorts of numbers out, people get a little depressed.
1266.21s - 1272.77s |  And they ask, is there no hope? And I would like to quote one of my favorite superheroes.
1275.01s - 1280.37s |  Oh, I will give you hope. And I ask only one thing in return.
1282.77s - 1292.80s |  Now, you might not recognize this man. But his name is Daniel O'Day. Interesting last name to
1292.80s - 1295.92s |  be talking about at a hacker conference. You figure somebody's going to fuck with him, right?
1296.80s - 1304.40s |  He is, as you might guess, lying to Congress. He is CEO of Gilead Pharmaceuticals. And he is lying
1304.40s - 1311.28s |  about the pricing structure of Sovaldi, which, as mentioned previously, is $1,000 a pill
1312.56s - 1321.44s |  and is $84,000 for a full course of treatment. Oh man, I had such like a climactic moment that
1322.32s - 1330.32s |  I was building to. Like I was so excited for the next thing. If I can pull it off, it will be great.
1330.32s - 1334.56s |  If not, it's like an NES, right? Everybody remembers this. It's a perfect trick. It should
1334.56s - 1343.12s |  work every time. So in the event that this doesn't work, I'll go a little further from memory. But
1345.97s - 1352.53s |  we need to get back to the how. I talked a lot about why. But there are tools that we have
1352.53s - 1357.97s |  specifically that will help you through the entire process. At the top is the automation of
1357.97s - 1363.49s |  the chemistry. And we have a tool for that. An actual way that you can automate the chemistry.
1364.05s - 1372.53s |  Below that, there's a system that will build the instruction set that the automation system will
1372.53s - 1380.29s |  run. Before that, you actually need to figure out how the synthesis is done. You need to figure out
1380.29s - 1386.69s |  how to start with some material and then work your way to your end product. And we have a tool
1386.69s - 1390.13s |  for that as well. And of course, somewhere along the line, you have to figure out what you want
1390.13s - 1400.83s |  to take for what's wrong. So the first thing is called the apothecary micro lab. And you're going
1400.83s - 1406.99s |  to have to take it on faith, but I got beautiful pictures of it. There are automated lab reactors
1406.99s - 1413.87s |  that are designed for chemistry. The way they work is fairly simple. There's a reaction chamber
1413.87s - 1423.87s |  in the inside. There's a jacket through which liquid flows that allows the reaction chamber to
1423.87s - 1429.95s |  maintain a particular temperature. There's a little paddle inside that will stir. And then there are
1429.95s - 1435.95s |  these little injection systems on the top. Now, problem is, many. First, they're closed source.
1441.23s - 1445.95s |  And they come with all the attendant problems with closed source systems. Number two, they're
1445.95s - 1451.79s |  ridiculously expensive. If you want the most basic model, it's going to be over $5,000. And even if
1451.79s - 1457.63s |  you have $5,000, you can't buy it unless you're a lab. Now, of course, there are ways around that,
1457.63s - 1464.83s |  but why would you want to pay $5,000 for something that just stirs, controls temperature,
1464.83s - 1470.35s |  and injects reagents at a particular time? You think you could probably do that yourself, right?
1471.47s - 1476.67s |  Well, I'm a very, very lucky man. I get to brag about some wonderful things that some brilliant
1476.67s - 1482.75s |  people have managed to build. And I get to brag about it unabashedly because I didn't do it. But
1483.07s - 1487.71s |  the apothecary micro lab is something we've been working on for many years and we have a new
1487.71s - 1493.79s |  version that I like to call version six. And it does all of these things. You have a small mason
1493.79s - 1501.79s |  jar inside of a larger mason jar. There's fluid that circulates around that, oh, that doesn't
1501.79s - 1508.67s |  look good. All right, moving on. There's a fluid that circulates around that regulates the
1508.67s - 1518.27s |  temperature. You've got a stirring paddle that comes in, it's made of Teflon so it's
1518.27s - 1526.19s |  non-reactive. And you've got these tubes that pump things in. The design is somewhat complex
1526.19s - 1533.23s |  and one thing that I should mention is that tomorrow at 11 a.m. in the creator, content
1533.23s - 1539.47s |  creators stage, we'll be doing an extended version of this talk. It's on, uh, in number two.
1539.47s - 1545.31s |  And we will be going through and we will be demonstrating the actual tool. We will be going
1545.31s - 1550.11s |  through, you will see it making medicines on stage. All of these online systems about which I'm
1550.11s - 1554.91s |  about to speak, you'll be able to interact with in real time because, uh, we were discouraged
1554.91s - 1562.15s |  from having live demos on the main stage because, well, you know. So, you'll also be able to, uh,
1565.95s - 1571.79s |  request particular drugs. If there's a drug that you'd like to know how to make, we'll try and
1571.79s - 1581.20s |  figure out a way on the fly, live. So, please come on by. It'll be fun. So, then antecedent to
1581.20s - 1588.96s |  the micro lab itself, we have a system called the recipe press. This is a graphical user interface
1588.96s - 1598.96s |  that allows you to take a procedure for making a chemical reaction happen and you get to then
1599.68s - 1607.12s |  input it and it will generate the code so that the system runs it. And the brains of it come in a
1607.12s - 1613.92s |  nice pretty box. I, I promise you it's so gorgeous. You'll love it. Come by tomorrow. Or just go on
1613.92s - 1618.16s |  our GitHub and you can see wonderful pictures of it because it's extremely well documented. Again,
1618.24s - 1626.24s |  I work with wonderful people. Or as we say, documentation or it's not a project, right? So, you
1627.84s - 1635.84s |  can then generate a file that the, that it will run and then beyond that, you can edit it. It will
1637.04s - 1643.12s |  talk you through the things that are easy for a human but difficult for machines do. There's a
1643.12s - 1648.72s |  touch screen that talks you through it. Then for the machine things where you just need to wait
1648.72s - 1652.96s |  for a long time and regulate the temperature and keep stirring which are easy for a human to get
1652.96s - 1659.44s |  distracted but great for a machine, it will do those for you. Before that, you need to figure
1659.44s - 1666.94s |  out again, the retrosynthesis. How do you get from point A to point B? A number of years ago we
1666.94s - 1672.38s |  developed a system that we called ChemHactica. It's a retrosynthesis module where what you can
1672.38s - 1678.66s |  do is literally hop on Wikipedia, look for your drug of choice, scroll down until you find the
1678.66s - 1684.86s |  smiles code and hackers out there, if you don't know about this, smiles codes are super dope.
1684.86s - 1691.70s |  Invited by the blue obelisk group, an open source way that you can represent any chemical or any
1691.70s - 1697.90s |  chemical reaction with an ASCII string. It's super cool. You copy that, you paste it into
1697.90s - 1704.62s |  ChemHactica and you say, how do I make this? It will find ways to do it. It does this
1704.62s - 1712.82s |  combinatorially by looking through all of the chemical literature historically and then it will
1712.82s - 1718.70s |  put the pieces together and find reactions that have already been tested and connect the dots for
1718.70s - 1726.13s |  you and it'll make it as simple as you want. How are you doing? Yeah, just a quick question.
1726.13s - 1729.81s |  Is that the right one? Is that the right one? Oh, no, no. No, this is not the right one. I see.
1729.81s - 1732.77s |  Yeah, that was my concern. I didn't want to go poking around your workstation.
1732.77s - 1736.69s |  Thank you. That's all right. Well, let's bear with us a moment.
1740.61s - 1754.82s |  All right. Here we go. Maybe. Just last week I had a guy interview me whose childhood friend.
1755.78s - 1770.85s |  Wonderful. Thank you. Probably. All right. Cool. I'm just going to sort of forward the slides
1770.85s - 1776.29s |  until it catches up with me. I got interviewed with a guy who told me this heartbreaking story
1776.29s - 1787.65s |  about his childhood friend dying of, I believe it was multiple sclerosis at 25 because she had a
1788.21s - 1796.45s |  very rare subtype and the medicine for that particular subtype because it was so rare
1797.33s - 1806.69s |  had been given orphan drug status which gave it this extended patent length and also allowed for
1807.49s - 1817.33s |  the price point to be whatever they wanted and it was priced at $850 a day and she died.
1818.45s - 1823.89s |  He and I sat down and I shared my screen with him and we went on Chemhaxica and in a matter of
1823.89s - 1831.41s |  minutes he and I, neither of us chemists, figured out a way to manufacture it for $20 a day. It's
1831.41s - 1836.93s |  that powerful of a tool. Now, that's not to say, of course, that there isn't some chemistry still
1836.93s - 1842.85s |  to be done. You do need to figure some things out, but this gets a huge jump on it. You could
1842.85s - 1850.77s |  potentially find a synthesis mechanism just with this and a good chemist rather than having a
1850.77s - 1858.61s |  giant team of them work for months. Additionally, this is how we figured out how to make Sovaldi.
1863.01s - 1865.89s |  It's tempting to skip ahead, but I kind of don't want to touch it.
1868.93s - 1872.13s |  I'll keep talking a little bit and see where we are on the clock here.
1873.17s - 1879.49s |  Um, how fragile is this? Where'd my guy go? All right, I'll just keep pressing the button.
1882.24s - 1890.64s |  So, both of these services are live now. The other thing to note about the, uh, is this safe?
1890.64s - 1895.28s |  Yeah, sure. Can I skip down? Yeah, I'm gonna unplug you. No, no, just hit escape. It's fine. Okay.
1895.28s - 1901.68s |  And then, uh, I can just scroll. Okay. Thank you for bearing with us through this process.
1902.32s - 1910.32s |  I appreciate you all. Oh, right. I was about to do a thing. Okay, cool. So, here we go. Yeah, I, I,
1910.32s - 1914.96s |  I guess I kind of gave it away, didn't I? All right, but here we go. All right, here's Daniel
1914.96s - 1925.12s |  O'Day. Ha! Lying to Congress about Sovaldi. And I think I have time to take exception to his
1925.12s - 1937.28s |  pricing structure. And my hacker friends, I have a question for you. Should I call him? All right,
1937.28s - 1942.48s |  now, don't everybody call him at once. He'll jam the line. Uh, we'll see, uh, we'll see what he
1942.48s - 1950.48s |  has to say. All right, Danny boy. Pipes are calling. 4 Thieves Vinegar is calling. And we're
1950.56s - 1960.56s |  not pleased with what you've done. So here we go. 4 1 5 5 3 3 3 9 7 6. Call him afterwards
1960.56s - 1975.04s |  if he doesn't answer, okay? Let's give this a try. Can you hear this? Can you hear this? Hi there,
1975.04s - 1984.11s |  Daniel O'Day please. Uh, who's calling? Uh, this is Dr. Michael Laufer. Dr. Michael Laufer from the
1984.11s - 1990.46s |  4 Thieves Vinegar collection please. Sorry, I can't understand what you're saying. Uh, I'm sorry,
1990.46s - 1996.14s |  the connection's bad. Dr. Michael Laufer, I'm calling from 4 Thieves. He's expecting my call.
1998.14s - 2010.83s |  He's expecting your call? Uh, yeah. Um, hold on a second. Thank you so much. Yep, I'm still here.
2013.82s - 2023.55s |  Dan, I still can't understand who you are. I'm sorry, can you say that again?
2023.55s - 2027.39s |  Yeah, Dr. Michael Laufer from the 4 Thieves Vinegar collective, I'm calling from Las Vegas.
2027.47s - 2039.31s |  He's expecting your call. Uh, well, can you put me on with him anyway? Who's this? Hi there,
2039.31s - 2042.19s |  it's Dr. Michael Laufer. I'm calling from the 4 Thieves Vinegar collective.
2044.11s - 2047.23s |  No, this isn't your call. I don't know how you got this number, but please don't call it again.
2048.03s - 2064.26s |  Well, you sure you don't want to chat? Hello? Well, I tried. I was gonna invite him down and
2064.26s - 2073.98s |  everything. Alright, moving on. How do you do DIY pharmaceuticals? Even if you don't have help?
2074.94s - 2082.94s |  Again, you have to automate the chemistry, you have to deal with the reaction, and oh, I'm, I'm,
2084.06s - 2089.34s |  I'm cutting down on time. So here, again, some of this stuff that I talked about, again, tomorrow
2089.34s - 2095.10s |  at 11am, creator stage 2, you can come by and you can get all the detail on this. I'm gonna skip
2095.10s - 2101.66s |  down again. And, uh, but you'll see, again, if you look in the, like, side column here, you can
2101.66s - 2106.22s |  see all of these really beautiful pictures of things. But I'll show you just one little bit
2106.22s - 2112.30s |  here. Uh, I'm gonna have to sort of jump back and forth. But here's the, uh, here's the micro lab
2112.30s - 2119.58s |  in all its glory. And it's actually doing chemistry here. Uh, this isn't gonna work. It was,
2120.54s - 2125.50s |  this was so slick when I put it together, I apologize. But here at the end, I'll show you
2125.50s - 2130.70s |  this little bit. You have your active pharmaceutical ingredient in the solution in this smaller jar.
2130.70s - 2135.74s |  And all you're going to do in the last step of most chemistry is just pour it through a coffee
2135.74s - 2141.02s |  filter. It's as simple as that. And once you do, then you're gonna sit there and you're gonna let
2141.02s - 2146.38s |  it drip. And all the impurities flow out and your active pharmaceutical ingredient is left and you
2146.38s - 2155.47s |  just dry out the coffee filter. And there's your drug. Again, come by tomorrow and you'll see this
2155.47s - 2161.63s |  all happen in real time. Um, I already talked through these systems, but again, these are
2161.63s - 2168.35s |  online services that we have, which we will show. Uh, the Recipe Press is a brilliant piece of work.
2169.15s - 2174.83s |  Chemhacktica is a brilliant piece of work. But let me just talk about Sovaldi specifically. Here it
2174.83s - 2178.83s |  is rendered in two dimensions. I'm sure you've seen this. For those of you who are chemistry
2178.83s - 2183.79s |  phobic, do not let this bother you. I promise this is simple. Our chemists are brilliant and did the
2183.79s - 2189.63s |  hard work. Here's what the reaction looks like. And the amazing part of this is that it is only
2189.63s - 2195.95s |  one step. So pay attention. This will be very quick. It will only take a moment. Here's what
2195.95s - 2203.07s |  you have. On the right, you will see this ring with fluorines. The fluorines and the oxygen will
2203.07s - 2208.83s |  break off like this and you get that little extra stick that wants to connect to an oxygen.
2208.83s - 2212.59s |  And there's that lonely little oxygen on the other side and they're going to make friends.
2214.11s - 2220.43s |  And they do it like this. And for those of you with good short-term memories, you will see that
2220.43s - 2226.27s |  this is indeed the molecule that we were trying to get at the beginning. A single step and you
2226.27s - 2233.95s |  can get this drug. You want to see it in three dimensions? Here you go. Again, the fluorines are
2233.95s - 2239.39s |  the green, the oxygens are the red. You're going to see this piece break off and you're going to
2239.39s - 2246.35s |  see this extra little stick and it wants to come around in a little smooch. And there's Sovaldi.
2247.55s - 2254.35s |  Now, eventually, you're going to have to make pills. They just passed a law that make owning a
2254.35s - 2261.63s |  pill press a felony. Hilarious. Because all you need is something that will press something.
2261.63s - 2266.11s |  I've had people tell me that reloading devices can do this. A simple Arbor press will do it too.
2267.07s - 2273.31s |  Say you want a pill mold? You can print one out of resin. Then you take your active
2273.31s - 2279.15s |  pharmaceutical ingredient, you tap it in, you fill it up, you put the plunger in,
2280.11s - 2282.83s |  you press it down, and then you spray it with glitter.
2285.06s - 2290.18s |  Why do you spray it with glitter? Well, to put it in the words of one of our chemists,
2290.74s - 2308.59s |  if it doesn't sparkle, it's not my revolution. I know I've put this figure up many times,
2309.31s - 2313.23s |  but it still horrifies me no matter how many times I see it.
2314.19s - 2323.23s |  This is a commercial Sovaldi pill. This is a $1,000 bill. Now, they're in circulation,
2323.23s - 2327.39s |  not much, but they're around. You can find them. They're mostly collector's items,
2328.27s - 2338.90s |  but you can get them. Grover Cleveland, everybody. $1,000. How ridiculous is this?
2339.62s - 2346.66s |  Now, contrastingly, here's our little pill that we made for $3.50 worth of materials.
2347.62s - 2356.80s |  So, here's a question. Which would you pick? Now, I happen to have one of these pills.
2357.60s - 2367.14s |  What would you pick? The bill or the pill? So, who would take this collector's item?
2368.90s - 2377.12s |  Yeah? All right, come up. Here. Now, these are actually worth more than $1,000 because
2378.08s - 2387.38s |  they're so rare. There you go. Yours to keep. Joke's on you, though. It's counterfeit. So,
2387.38s - 2390.82s |  you're actually in violation of a whole bunch of laws right now because you took that from me.
2393.36s - 2400.56s |  Contrastingly, this is not counterfeit. It's pirated. There's a difference. This doesn't
2400.56s - 2407.76s |  try to look like something it's not. This does the exact same thing as the thing that it's trying
2407.76s - 2415.92s |  to be. And it doesn't have to try. This is both chemically and isomorphically identical to
2415.92s - 2426.24s |  anything that you would get in a pharmacy if you had the money. Now, I get this question a lot.
2427.76s - 2431.04s |  Now, of course, the point of all of this is that you don't have to test it.
2432.00s - 2437.76s |  The systems are designed so that all of the care and attention you can get on the front end and
2437.76s - 2444.96s |  then you don't have to. But we did anyway. Anybody out there who knows how to read a high performance
2444.96s - 2454.24s |  liquid chromatography readout will see that this is fucking amazing. That spike is perfect. There's
2454.24s - 2459.52s |  only one thing in there. For those of you who don't read these, here's something a little more
2459.52s - 2470.70s |  quantitative and I will draw your attention to this number. That's the purity. Before you get
2470.70s - 2478.14s |  too impressed, allow me to say, if you were to buy Sovaldi in the raw from a chemical supplier,
2478.14s - 2483.66s |  you only get 98 percent. Again, for those of you who are astute with numbers, you will notice this
2483.66s - 2491.74s |  is an order of magnitude more pure than what you would get if you bought it. Where'd my goon go?
2491.74s - 2502.18s |  I need another shot. Thank you, sir. Watch this. My team's watching and they're all freaking out
2502.18s - 2515.82s |  right now because I didn't tell them I was going to do this. And I don't even have the hepatitis
2515.82s - 2525.89s |  that I know of. All right, let's keep going. I have five minutes. Want to quote some other
2525.89s - 2535.39s |  superheroes? You'll notice this. Now, this is the fourth time I'm mentioning this.
2536.35s - 2545.31s |  And I mention this because this entire course of treatment can be made for $300 in raw materials.
2546.75s - 2555.71s |  And I happen to have it right here. Now, who said they had a friend who was infected with hepatitis?
2556.83s - 2569.04s |  There were a couple people. Right here? You. Come up here. Keep your friend healthy.
2569.04s - 2583.33s |  Keep them safe. Thank you so much. We should be doing this every day. I get this question a lot.
2588.53s - 2597.09s |  I'm going to move on now. Again, if you don't differentiate between morality and legality,
2597.09s - 2602.53s |  one of us is in the wrong conference. Again, none of our work scales up. This is worth noting because
2602.53s - 2605.57s |  those of you who are like, wow, he does stuff super cheap. Maybe I could start a business.
2605.57s - 2610.21s |  It won't work. I mean, go nuts. Right. But you're going to be wasting it. Talk to a chemical
2610.21s - 2614.69s |  engineer. Scaling chemistry is very difficult. When you do it on a small scale, it's much easier.
2615.65s - 2620.21s |  And additionally, some people are like, oh, that's super exciting. How do I get one? You make it.
2620.21s - 2625.97s |  We don't sell anything. We don't even sell merch. We have a merch page on our website showing you
2625.97s - 2636.18s |  how you can make your own. You've all seen this stamp. This is when an authority figure tells you
2636.18s - 2643.38s |  you're allowed. Now, some people decided this might look cute, but you will never see this
2643.38s - 2648.98s |  on anything ever because we are not an authority figure and we are not telling you what to think
2648.98s - 2655.06s |  or what to do. The only thing that the Four Thieves Vinegar Collective will ever approve
2656.26s - 2663.86s |  is you making your own decisions about your own health. And that we've already approved.
2663.86s - 2676.10s |  So go on and do the thing. I'm running low on time. So I'm going to skip this slide,
2676.10s - 2681.22s |  but we have some more deep ideological ideas that I would rant about if I had more on the clock.
2685.30s - 2688.98s |  Again, come to the Biohacking Village tomorrow. You'll be able to see everything.
2691.10s - 2696.38s |  This is an American phrase, isn't it? I'm going to add another one from the same
2697.10s - 2705.41s |  genre. And with this, I would like to address the feds out there
2705.49s - 2711.73s |  and some of the execs from pharmacy. I've spotted some of you during the day.
2713.09s - 2717.65s |  And I'd like to say the following. I would rather be singing your praises.
2718.93s - 2725.89s |  I would like it much better if you did your work properly so that our work became obsolete
2725.89s - 2733.65s |  and we could go do something else. But until you do, if you would like to stop me,
2734.61s - 2742.13s |  you will have to send assassins. Because so long as you stand between people
2742.85s - 2751.41s |  and the medicines they need due to your greed or your ignorance or your cowardice,
2752.53s - 2758.61s |  I will fight you until I curse you with my dying breath. And when you kill me,
2759.57s - 2767.57s |  it won't matter much. I'm just another human like the thousands who die from your inaction
2767.57s - 2773.09s |  every day. And the other members of Four Thieves will step in to continue the work.
2773.73s - 2778.21s |  And the future members of Four Thieves that are probably sitting right next to you now
2779.41s - 2783.01s |  will come to join them. And the ones far away we haven't even met yet,
2783.25s - 2796.48s |  yet. Because we are fighting for nothing less than our lives. Help is not on the way.
2797.44s - 2804.32s |  I will say this last. My fellow hackers, come join us. And we have one last tool
2805.04s - 2811.28s |  that everyone can use. And you don't need to read anything about it. And you don't need
2812.00s - 2818.32s |  to build anything. The next time a medical officer says you can't have what you need,
2818.96s - 2821.76s |  look them in the eye and say, if you will not help me,
2823.28s - 2829.28s |  I will make this myself. Because that's the truth. You can. Thank you so much.
