**Introduction to Bug Bounty Programs**
- Insight into the **bug bounty world** from diverse perspectives
- Importance of understanding program management and running policy villages

**Panel Introductions**
- **Katie Noble**: Background in behavior analysis; runs product security and bug bounty for a Fortune 50 company
- **Jonathan Kuskos**: Known as Bad Idea; experience as a bug bounty hunter and managing disclosure programs
- **Sam**: Security engineer at Google; involved in Google bug bounty programs
- **Logan and Jeff**: Work at GitHub in bug bounty programs

**Getting into Bug Bounties**
- Many started with **responsible disclosure** and bug bounty hunting due to financial needs or interest
- Experience with **penetration testing** and responsible disclosure as gateways into bug bounties

**Tools and Techniques**
- Importance of speed in identifying and rejecting non-viable targets
- Use of **automation tools** like intercepting proxies and NMAT for discovering vulnerabilities
- Behavioral tools and **common sense** as critical components in assessing reports

**Human vs. Automation**
- **Human efforts** in negotiations and understanding complex vulnerabilities
- Limitations of **AI-generated reports** in hardware and software contexts
- Human intuition in identifying vulnerabilities that bypass automated defenses

**Preventing Burnout**
- Balance work and personal life to avoid burnout
- **Rotation systems** within organizations to prevent employee fatigue
- Automation and process improvements as key strategies to mitigate workload

**Qualities of a Good Bug Bounty Program**
- Programs should be responsive, have interesting targets, and pay promptly
- Differentiation between **bug hunters** motivated by financial gain and those seeking recognition
- Different incentives for **different types of researchers** (e.g., academics, friendly helpers)

**Bounty Farming and Ethical Considerations**
- **Bounty farming**: Reporting the same vulnerability across multiple targets
- Importance of clear program terms to prevent exploitation
- Encouragement for researchers to submit all findings promptly

**Future of Bug Bounty Programs**
- Programs need to adapt and incorporate security findings back into the **development lifecycle**
- Emphasis on building trust between researchers and companies to ensure ethical reporting and resolution
- **Community collaboration** among program managers to enhance program effectiveness and researcher satisfaction
