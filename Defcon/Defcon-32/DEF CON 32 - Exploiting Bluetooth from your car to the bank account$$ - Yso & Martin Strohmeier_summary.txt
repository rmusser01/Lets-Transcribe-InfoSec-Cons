**Talk Overview**
- **Growth in Infotainment Systems:** Over the past decade, infotainment systems have expanded in functionality and integration into vehicle architecture.
- **Bluetooth Vulnerabilities:** The increasing role of **wireless protocols** like **Bluetooth** combined with a lack of patches introduces new attack surfaces.
- **BlueToolkit Framework:** A comprehensive framework for testing and replaying **Bluetooth Classic vulnerabilities**. Offers practical information and new exploits.
- **Research Findings:** Discovery of 64 new vulnerabilities in 22 modern cars and the **Garmin Flight Stream** flight management system.

**Speakers**
- **Vladislav (Yso):** Bug bounty hunter, cybersecurity master at **ETH Zurich**, key contributor to the research.
- **Martin Strohmeier:** Security researcher at the Swiss **cyber defense campus**, focus on transportation systems and **aviation**.

**Motivation and Research Goals**
- **Procurement Arm of Federal Government:** Involved in buying a variety of systems, aiming for early security testing to avoid post-tender vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Research:** Focus on **standards** and systems with long lifecycles, acknowledging changes can take decades.
- **Case Study:** Examination of vehicles and the army's use of **Bluetooth Classic**, not **Bluetooth Low Energy**.

**Bluetooth Technology and Security**
- **Complexity:** **Bluetooth** as a **wireless communication standard** with a complex tech stack and multiple profiles for various use cases.
- **Security Models:** Four options for pairing, with only **numeric comparison** currently known as secure.
- **Vulnerabilities:** Over 108 Bluetooth vulnerabilities identified, with **650 CVEs** related to Bluetooth devices as of 2022.

**Research Methodology**
- **BlueToolkit Development:** Creation of a Bluetooth test kit to cover all known security vulnerabilities.
- **Testing Setup:** Utilizes Ubuntu-based systems; requires specific hardware like the **Nexus 5 phone** for full testing capabilities.
- **Car Testing:** Tested on 22 different cars from various manufacturers, covering approximately 60% of the global market.

**Results and Findings**
- **Vulnerabilities Found:** 73 vulnerabilities discovered across tested vehicles, reported to manufacturers.
- **Age of Technology:** The median age of a Bluetooth version in cars is seven years behind the latest standard.
- **Novel Exploits:** Two new exploits discovered, including contact extraction and man-in-the-middle positioning.

**Implications and Takeaways**
- **Insecurity of Bluetooth:** Recognized as fundamentally insecure, with vulnerabilities in both protocol and implementation.
- **Toolkit Availability:** BlueToolkit available for testing individual car vulnerabilities at the Bluetooth level.
- **Recommendations for Manufacturers:** Encouragement to use the toolkit for assessing **security posture** regarding Bluetooth.
