0.00s - 9.92s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 All right, Defcon. How tired are you of people asking you how you're doing? Yeah? Cheer really
9.92s - 17.23s |  loudly if you're really tired of that. The other thing I'm trying to do is get people
17.23s - 24.71s |  out there to realize how good a time you guys are having in here. So I'm going to say, um,
24.71s - 30.23s |  no one doesn't like cake, right? I mean, cake is universally. Can we all cheer for cake?
30.23s - 38.95s |  Yeah! Everyone out there, come in here. All right, folks. Welcome to, uh, another creator
38.95s - 44.79s |  stage talk. We have some killer folks here to talk to you about some very pressing issues.
44.79s - 48.39s |  And I know we started out with cake, which is going to be the high mark. We're going
48.39s - 52.11s |  to be talking about healthcare, cybersecurity, medical devices, whistleblowing, and a bunch
52.11s - 56.43s |  of other really cool stuff. In some sense, it can be a little bit of a downer. So I don't
56.43s - 59.51s |  have any trigger warnings or anything for our panel, but the only thing I'll ask is
59.51s - 62.87s |  for the audience, uh, we'll have an opportunity for a little Q and a at the end, unless we
62.87s - 68.23s |  go really over, uh, but just be respectful of the community and other folks. Uh, because
68.23s - 72.19s |  sometimes this can be a really personal thing as we're going to talk about. I think the
72.19s - 76.75s |  first thing we're going to do is actually go down the line and do introductions. And
76.75s - 80.35s |  before I do that, can you guys hear us? Okay. I know we're competing over here. You guys
80.35s - 84.27s |  are good. All right. So let's go ahead and, uh, let's go right down the line, Matt on
84.27s - 89.23s |  and go to introduce yourself, tell the crowd what you do. And, uh, we'll get going on to
89.23s - 94.87s |  the real good questions. All right. After you, sounds good. Um, I'm Matt Hazlett. I'm
94.87s - 102.27s |  the chief regulatory officer at MedSec currently. I most recently left the FDA a couple of weeks
102.27s - 108.23s |  ago. Um, I was at the FDA for eight and a half years. Um, started getting very involved
108.23s - 115.51s |  in the cybersecurity policy, um, and implementation efforts. So I was very involved in the pre-market
115.51s - 122.59s |  cybersecurity guidance, writing a significant portion of that, um, and overseer oversaw
122.59s - 128.31s |  our implementation efforts. So the reviewer resources training of how we were going to
128.31s - 131.83s |  review cybersecurity, given our new statutory authorities,
131.83s - 143.90s |  Hi everyone. I am Erica Chung. I'm currently the executive director of a nonprofit called
143.90s - 149.46s |  ethics and entrepreneurship. Uh, my interest in the safety of medical devices started
149.46s - 156.62s |  off at my very first job. When I was 22 years old, I was a lab associate working for a biomedical
156.62s - 162.06s |  company called Theranos, which ended up being a $9 billion fraud scandal, which I was one
162.06s - 167.14s |  of the key whistleblowers who reported the company to regulators that stopped them from
167.14s - 175.94s |  utilizing a faulty device on patients. And, uh, I am also involved, uh, as a board member
175.94s - 180.86s |  of whistleblowers of America, which we provide mental health services and peer support for
180.86s - 186.78s |  whistleblowers across the United States. And also a advisor to the signals network, which
186.78s - 194.54s |  is a agency that helps whistleblowers with legal advice, uh, safe housing, uh, funding
194.54s - 200.14s |  job placement in the event that, um, they are in need of those services.
200.14s - 202.34s |  Give it up for Erica.
202.34s - 210.18s |  Hey everybody. Um, I'm Andrew Carney. Uh, I'm a program manager at a relatively new
210.18s - 216.82s |  federal agency ARPA-H where I work on healthcare cybersecurity, uh, patient data privacy. Um,
216.82s - 221.22s |  I'm also the program manager for the AI cyber challenge at DARPA. Uh, so if you haven't
221.22s - 225.90s |  already, please come visit us next door, uh, and spend some time there, have some fun.
225.90s - 231.10s |  And before all of that, um, I spent most of the last 15 years as a vulnerability researcher
231.10s - 239.58s |  and a painful CTF player. Um, and I am now semi-retired from that fabulous pastime. Um,
239.58s - 243.50s |  please go check out DEF CON CTF as well. If you haven't, the folks put on an amazing game.
243.50s - 249.54s |  Um, and I'm super excited to be, uh, so the last year, uh, plus in healthcare, uh, looking
249.54s - 253.94s |  at the health cybersecurity of healthcare and, um, coming from a very offensive kind
253.94s - 259.14s |  of mindset, uh, just seeing what we can, seeing what we can do from a defensive kind of position
259.14s - 263.74s |  and, and really, um, hoping to supercharge kind of our efforts to safeguard, uh, this,
263.74s - 264.74s |  this sector.
264.74s - 265.74s |  Give it up, Andrew.
265.74s - 277.38s |  I'm the deputy director of CISA. Hopefully you've heard of us, some ways you've performed.
277.38s - 282.54s |  Um, and, uh, my earlier in my career, I was actually a hospital administrator and a flight
282.54s - 286.94s |  medic. So I started my career in healthcare. So it's great to be here today to merge cybersecurity
286.94s - 290.82s |  and healthcare together and talk about what we can all do, uh, to continue to make the
290.82s - 297.26s |  sector more safe. Thanks.
297.26s - 301.02s |  All right. So we're gonna, yeah, this is give it up for the whole panel. Try to beat them
301.02s - 309.30s |  out next door. All right. I think it's important to level set a little bit, but I want to take
309.30s - 313.54s |  a poll. The audience real quick, raise your hand. If you work in healthcare, some adjacent
313.54s - 318.30s |  field, raise your hand. There's no one in this audience. This is all brand new for you.
318.30s - 323.14s |  I take it. Just kidding. It's like everyone, it's like my high school reunion out there.
323.14s - 327.38s |  All right. I do think it's important for us to level set a little bit. And we're gonna
327.38s - 331.38s |  talk about threat land landscape a bit. I have some, a little bit of a couple of slides
331.38s - 337.18s |  at the end, but a deputy director, you could tell us a little bit more than about the threat
337.18s - 343.58s |  landscape and what you're seeing kind of nationally about healthcare ransomware because, and just
343.58s - 347.86s |  healthcare threats, generally speaking, just give us a little bit of a one-on-one and what
347.86s - 348.86s |  do you see?
348.86s - 352.42s |  Thanks for sure. I think the big thing we're trying to message out to folks as we look
352.42s - 356.90s |  at the healthcare sector, we're seeing an increase in the volume frequency and complexity
356.90s - 361.70s |  of attacks against the healthcare sector, not just in the United States, but globally.
361.70s - 367.04s |  I think when we think about healthcare, if we go back to kinetic warfare going back centuries,
367.04s - 372.14s |  we never attacked hospitals, right? We always protected healthcare providers. We always
372.14s - 376.42s |  protected the tents with the red cross on it. We never attacked those institutions,
376.42s - 380.50s |  but today we're seeing attacks against healthcare organizations throughout the country. This
380.50s - 384.66s |  is not just about urban America. We're seeing attacks against rural America as well, where
384.66s - 389.14s |  arguably healthcare systems are more critical in those communities, given the access to
389.14s - 393.34s |  care and the access to backup care is much further away and the consequence of patient
393.34s - 398.50s |  safety is even greater. As we look at a lot of, everyone has published a top three or
398.50s - 404.98s |  a top five list of ransomware attacks or sector impacts. Healthcare continues to be in that
404.98s - 409.78s |  top three and top five list of every list that I see as sectors that are being attacked
409.78s - 413.34s |  by our adversaries. And we're not just talking about nation states. We're not just talking
413.34s - 417.30s |  about China, Russia, Iran, North Korea. We're seeing cyber terrorists and cyber criminal
417.30s - 422.38s |  organizations also attacking healthcare. Why they foresee money there. They know that,
422.38s - 427.54s |  I think healthcare facilities are kind of one-stop shops. You have access to PII, you
427.54s - 430.94s |  have access to billing information, you have patient information, you have information
430.94s - 435.06s |  that essentially people don't want out in the public space that you can get a hold of.
435.06s - 439.02s |  It really is that one-stop shop and our adversaries know this. So we're continuing to see this
439.02s - 442.94s |  increase in attacks against healthcare, which is why it's even more critical today to make
442.94s - 446.62s |  sure that we're building resilience across the healthcare space. And when we talk about
446.62s - 452.34s |  healthcare, it's not just hospitals, it's that entire spectrum that's needed for healthcare
452.34s - 458.58s |  to be delivered. So it includes medical manufacturing, distribution of pharma, labs, blood, biotech,
458.58s - 464.10s |  health IT, insurers, payers, HMOs, that entire spectrum that's needed for that clinical care
464.10s - 467.26s |  to be delivered. And we want to make sure that we're continuing to build resilience
467.26s - 470.06s |  across the board.
470.06s - 474.02s |  That is awesome. And I have a couple slides to now take a little bit of another audience
474.02s - 481.02s |  poll here. Raise your hand if you've ever had your medical records leak or be breached.
481.02s - 487.22s |  Raise your hand. All right. That number is growing every time. I'm going to just take
487.22s - 491.82s |  a gut pull here for anyone brave enough to raise their hand. Has anyone had their clinical
491.82s - 497.10s |  care impacted by some type of cyber attack? Maybe your appointment was canceled. I'm seeing
497.10s - 501.74s |  a couple of hands. Maybe you couldn't go to the hospital that was nearby. You heard
501.74s - 506.54s |  about that? Now there's a couple hands. That's going to increase because what are we seeing
506.54s - 514.34s |  now? You know, 2024 has been a banner year for healthcare ransomware. And we're seeing
514.34s - 519.26s |  big attacks and some not ransomware things like CrowdStrike. But what I wanted to show
519.26s - 524.10s |  you guys is for those of you who don't really work in this very often, now it's not just
524.10s - 531.58s |  about privacy of data. It's not just about the financial threat. It's also about threats
531.58s - 540.78s |  to clinical care and human life. And so here's some social media I grabbed based on one of
540.78s - 545.18s |  these attacks this year about people that were working. These are doctor and nursing
545.18s - 551.10s |  forums on Reddit and other places where they basically talk about their experience working
551.10s - 556.38s |  at some of these hospitals during a ransomware attack. And so in true DEF CON fashion it's
556.38s - 561.90s |  stuff like largest hospital system in the country is under attack. No one knows where
561.90s - 569.22s |  the forms are. We got a separate sign out. Nursing staff was trying to communicate what
569.22s - 573.74s |  medications patients are on. Had to do stuff from memory. We were just told the internet
573.74s - 577.46s |  may be out for days. We're still on a previous owner's network and they're down in multiple
577.46s - 581.58s |  states. And then there's a nursing comment here. Vermont here, they never taught me how
581.58s - 588.86s |  to use paper chart in nursing school. What about this one? We brought a trauma patient
588.86s - 593.46s |  to an Ascension hospital and the trauma team was freaking out because half the team didn't
593.46s - 598.50s |  get the page or notification. They're down doing paper charts, handwriting orders and
598.50s - 607.30s |  doing consults over their personal phones. The top comment says they couldn't get Tylenol
607.30s - 618.54s |  for a patient that needed it for two hours. We also learned a lot about critical connected
618.54s - 623.42s |  infrastructure this last year with things like CrowdStrike where it wasn't even an attack
623.42s - 628.38s |  but we saw huge amounts of hospitals go down as a consequence. And this is a couple social
628.38s - 633.82s |  media grabs I pulled for the CrowdStrike issue. I swear to you I pulled this image on the
633.82s - 639.46s |  left here right off of Reddit. So when the hospital went down, they took all their patients
639.46s - 643.14s |  and had to write them on a white board where they were, what their name was and what the
643.14s - 650.98s |  current issue was. On the same white board below they drew this picture. The ICU telemetry
650.98s - 656.40s |  monitors are down. They said that the ones in the NICU weren't operational. They're unable
656.40s - 660.86s |  to upload labs. How many of you folks think this type of stuff is really important? The
660.86s - 665.02s |  ability to do laboratory tests and imaging and do things in the electronic health record.
665.02s - 670.62s |  Raise your hand. How many of you feel like doctors and nurses can't be good at the jobs
670.62s - 674.70s |  of taking care of their sick patients without these things? Raise your hand. You are correct.
674.70s - 680.70s |  And so we're going to go into kind of the first question at the tip of this little period
680.70s - 686.46s |  here. Cyber attacks degrade, delay, disrupt and decay the digital systems that power timely
686.46s - 690.94s |  life-saving medical care. And for this we're going to go into this Q&A and try to get
690.94s - 694.30s |  some amazing insights from the folks here. But I also remind you there's an opportunity
694.30s - 699.68s |  at the end to ask some questions yourself. So the first question has to do with a lot
699.68s - 705.62s |  of what we continue to learn more about every year is this interdependency. So after 2008,
705.62s - 711.30s |  the financial crisis, the nation went under a painstaking process to try to better understand
711.30s - 715.78s |  and map the dependencies of the financial sector. To understand if this bank fails,
715.78s - 721.78s |  what will happen to the rest of it? In 2024, we've seen a bunch of attacks, change, ascension
721.78s - 726.62s |  and then Krauszak was an attack. But the question I have for the first part of this panel is
726.62s - 731.74s |  should the U.S. undergo a similar mapping exercise, right? Where we understand where
731.74s - 736.74s |  the critical interdependencies, third party risk are of healthcare delivery organizations
736.74s - 741.66s |  in this country because to my knowledge, no one knows what's going to happen. No one knows
741.66s - 746.38s |  where the linchpins of linchpins are. We have a pile of them. So the first question
746.38s - 750.46s |  is what do you all think about mapping the sector dependencies and what we should do
750.46s - 753.42s |  about that? And this is not a new thing and we've been doing it for a little bit but let's
753.42s - 755.26s |  learn about it now. What's going on?
755.26s - 761.26s |  So I'm happy to go first. I'm a huge fan of mapping out the sector, something I tried
761.26s - 766.86s |  to do actually when I was at HHS back in 2009. I think the challenge is it's getting that
766.86s - 771.58s |  visibility and I think we've made some progress. CISA right now is trying to look at, can I
771.58s - 774.78s |  ask any consequence analysis and part of that is really understanding, mapping out
774.78s - 779.62s |  the sectors, understanding where those critical nodes are. I think so we are much further
779.62s - 783.78s |  ahead than where we were 20 years ago but I still offer we're still nowhere near where
783.78s - 792.14s |  we need to be to truly understand those interdependencies within a sector, much less between sectors.
792.14s - 797.74s |  I think the other part of it is is getting visibility to understanding the actual software
797.74s - 801.26s |  platforms and the other challenges. So it's one thing to say that the connections exist
801.26s - 806.62s |  between this type of financial system and healthcare and agriculture and those types
806.62s - 811.18s |  of entities but to get to that next level to understand the market space, to understand
811.18s - 815.22s |  that is just a massive undertaking. We've done, there's pockets of it. There's a great
815.22s - 820.46s |  report from 2013 that looked at working through the Department of Commerce that looked at
820.46s - 825.26s |  understanding global supply chain issues for pharmaceuticals and some medical devices.
825.26s - 829.34s |  So there's pockets of this type of information out there but we don't have the ability yet
829.38s - 834.34s |  to kind of coalesce it. We've launched a recent IT tool called Star that we're trying to use
834.34s - 838.22s |  to really understand some of that but it's still at a very macro level. There's a lot
838.22s - 842.02s |  more that needs to get done. A lot of that information is proprietary so getting access
842.02s - 846.34s |  to it is somewhat of a challenge and then frankly the question I always ask when we
846.34s - 850.26s |  think about how the government should be asking questions and getting information, the next
850.26s - 854.06s |  question I always ask is what are we going to do with it? I never want to be in a government
854.06s - 858.90s |  agency where we're asking for information that we can't actually use to have some return
858.90s - 862.78s |  on investment and value back to the people providing information and understanding what
862.78s - 866.62s |  that looks like is another piece that we're trying to figure out. How do we get information
866.62s - 871.54s |  and how do we ensure there's an adequate ROI back to those information sharers that can
871.54s - 874.58s |  help them increase their cyber defense posture?
874.58s - 881.58s |  Just kind of building on that, I mean the, it's really interesting talking to different
882.10s - 888.86s |  stakeholders in both industry and government about their introspection into kind of the
888.86s - 894.70s |  interdependencies and then the acknowledgement that there may be common good kind of upstream
894.70s - 899.06s |  but perhaps a reticence to actually provide the information that would enable that common
899.06s - 906.06s |  good to manifest and so there we've, you know, talking to folks over the last year and sort
906.34s - 911.02s |  of trying to identify like how do we get a lot of value from investment of public kind
911.02s - 915.30s |  of public interest of taxpayer dollars from a research perspective, from a kind of transition
915.30s - 920.50s |  or ops perspective, how do we find those really high value points to insert, inject
920.50s - 927.10s |  kind of like support and it requires collaboration at a pretty large scale but it doesn't necessarily
927.10s - 931.66s |  require exposure like for, you know, the folks that are, that we would need to kind of talk
931.66s - 935.98s |  to that we are talking to, you know, folks are getting braver and that's a very good
935.98s - 941.68s |  sign and sort of recognizing that this is, you know, we all win together or we all lose.
941.68s - 945.04s |  So I think we're making progress but we could definitely make progress faster.
945.04s - 952.04s |  I'd say on the medical device side it's incredibly interesting to think about how to scope such
955.48s - 961.56s |  an exercise because you're going to have differences, the medical device landscape is incredibly
961.56s - 968.56s |  complex when you're ranging from implants to bedside equipment, capital equipment, software
969.56s - 976.08s |  functions that only operate on a mobile device or in the cloud, then looking at what's actually
976.08s - 983.08s |  used in different facilities and whether there's differentiation between similar devices from
983.20s - 990.20s |  other manufacturers. So if you have one issue from one device type, do they have a backup
990.44s - 997.44s |  that can still have some continuity of care? We've also seen a lot of discussions around
999.32s - 1005.32s |  hospital CISOs trying to figure out how to respond to ransomware and what devices are
1005.32s - 1011.68s |  relying on network or external connections because the initial response is to pull that
1011.68s - 1018.68s |  network down and retract in order to better defend the larger ecosystem. But we've seen
1019.92s - 1026.16s |  instances where all of a sudden the product security people are running to those CISOs
1026.16s - 1032.56s |  or they flip the switch to tell them that if they do that they have surgeries in progress
1032.56s - 1038.76s |  that would be interrupted because they're losing that live access. So how do we maintain
1038.76s - 1045.36s |  that continuity of care in response and how do we know what would be impacted based off
1045.36s - 1050.80s |  of different actions that could be taken to resolve some of these issues? So the mapping
1050.96s - 1056.80s |  can get incredibly complex. So then it's the how do you approach it and how do you make
1056.80s - 1063.80s |  it useful for the facilities that are using it as well as useful for government regulators
1064.60s - 1076.20s |  to help in response activities as well. Kind of a terrifying thought. So many times when
1076.20s - 1081.00s |  I think about these types of problems, I'm always like, surely someone has done this
1081.04s - 1086.64s |  and surely we have really great data on this. And so the thought of that we don't really
1086.64s - 1093.00s |  even understand these interdependencies at any deep level and certainly don't have visibility
1093.00s - 1097.36s |  over the entirety of the problem makes me think about how many other CrowdStrike-like
1097.36s - 1101.40s |  issues we're going to have. Or like what's going to happen when, we'll talk about this
1101.40s - 1105.24s |  in a little bit, when there's only really three or four electronic health record vendors
1105.24s - 1110.60s |  in the whole country and we don't understand the technical plumbing behind it and understand
1110.60s - 1114.00s |  what's really going to happen when something goes down. All right, we're going to go to
1114.00s - 1119.84s |  question two here. All right, this question does not apply to anyone in this room, I guarantee
1119.84s - 1125.34s |  it. Just kidding, it's everyone. Hackers, cyber security professionals employed at health
1125.34s - 1130.04s |  systems, medical device manufacturers are often not considered whistleblower protections
1130.04s - 1137.16s |  unless they see criminal activity. But we hear time and time again from folks in these
1137.16s - 1142.64s |  spaces that they see problems and they can't fix them. And they're increasingly worried
1142.64s - 1148.72s |  about what would happen when these issues are not fixed. So my question to the panel
1148.72s - 1156.12s |  is really just talking about should we expand protections to folks in technical healthcare
1156.12s - 1161.32s |  roles or you could say technical roles more broadly that offer some protections when they
1161.32s - 1166.84s |  don't necessarily cross the line of criminality but they believe in good faith that there
1166.84s - 1175.24s |  is going to be some issue before the ransomware hits. So maybe also take it away.
1175.24s - 1180.48s |  So I think when these whistleblower complaints sort of come about, you have to understand
1180.48s - 1185.44s |  where they exist. Is it happening internally in the company? And is there a concern that
1185.44s - 1190.20s |  you can address with the internal controls that exist within a company? And a lot of
1190.20s - 1196.04s |  that is do you have the leadership buy-in? Do you have the board buy-in to take cyber
1196.04s - 1201.16s |  security concerns seriously? And how do you sort of implement that culture within that
1201.16s - 1208.68s |  organization to have them say this is a top critical issue in order to maintain good business
1208.68s - 1214.80s |  practices, in order to maintain patient safety by the examples that you have seen. And so
1214.80s - 1220.96s |  there's a lot of work to be done in terms of what can the infrastructure within an organization
1220.96s - 1225.28s |  look like so the people that are working with these technologies can action on them
1225.28s - 1231.20s |  appropriately. And then there's the sort of external whistleblower. I've tried to basically
1231.20s - 1236.08s |  work within my organization. It doesn't seem like these issues are going to be addressed.
1236.08s - 1242.62s |  So what do I do now? Who do I turn to in order to prevent some major crisis from happening?
1242.62s - 1248.28s |  And I will say if there are lines that are crossed, if say a company does not make a
1248.36s - 1254.44s |  disclosure about a hack that has happened, then there are ways in which you can report to the
1254.44s - 1259.00s |  SEC that they didn't make the appropriate disclosures for the information that was
1259.00s - 1265.96s |  granted. And you are covered under federal whistleblower protections in those cases.
1265.96s - 1270.76s |  And then there are also several different whistleblower protections that exist at a state
1270.76s - 1276.84s |  level. But it has to sort of pay attention to what those agencies are. And then it also depends
1276.84s - 1283.16s |  what type of regulatory agency. Are you talking to the HHS? Are you talking to the SEC? Who are
1283.16s - 1289.16s |  the appropriate parties involved that can help guide you through the process of getting
1289.16s - 1295.24s |  the concern addressed? Whether it's patient information that shouldn't have been disclosed
1295.24s - 1299.96s |  that is disclosed, whether it's a ransomware attack that instead of sort of addressing that
1299.96s - 1308.04s |  and submitting that to the FBI or someone else that that happened. And with those, there should
1308.04s - 1313.88s |  be expansion of those protections for some of these people. But it's also about kind of turning
1313.88s - 1318.92s |  back to the internal controls. What most of these people who are reporting these concerns are
1318.92s - 1325.24s |  concerned about are, can I maintain my anonymity? If I can't maintain my anonymity, will I be able
1325.24s - 1331.72s |  to keep my job? Am I going to face any type of retaliation? Is there going to be litigation
1331.72s - 1338.04s |  involved? Is there going to be public backlash? Am I going to get blacklisted from my career?
1338.04s - 1343.08s |  And so I think that's some of the things fundamentally and structurally, both in terms of
1343.08s - 1349.32s |  like how we treat people who report concerns, in addition to the sort of external infrastructure
1349.32s - 1355.40s |  that we need to take into consideration, considering we're seeing so many people speak up
1355.40s - 1359.16s |  about the fact that they're seeing these attacks, but they don't really know what to do because
1359.16s - 1364.52s |  there's not necessarily enough external pressure to address them just yet. So I think those are
1364.52s - 1370.04s |  some of the fundamentals to pay attention to when it comes to working with people who are
1370.04s - 1374.92s |  concerned about these issues, but the regulatory landscape isn't as clear cut yet.
1375.00s - 1380.68s |  Raise your hand if you've ever worked for a healthcare organization, you had some real
1380.68s - 1384.92s |  concerns about the security, you raised them a bunch of times and then nothing happened and
1384.92s - 1393.56s |  you found a new job. Raise your hand. Yep. That's a common story. There should be more hands up.
1393.56s - 1402.76s |  I've talked to you guys at bars. Anything else? Any comments? I'm going to pull a little bit of
1402.76s - 1406.44s |  a thread out of that if that's all right. I was just amazed at the work that you do to support
1406.44s - 1411.16s |  whistleblowers. And one of the things I learned is how much you do to support the mental health
1411.16s - 1415.96s |  and wellbeing of these whistleblowers as they go through incredibly stressful situations.
1415.96s - 1420.68s |  I imagine there are folks in this audience that feel similarly, those stress and pressure. And
1420.68s - 1425.32s |  if we could just take a moment, if you have any advice, suggestions, anything that folks out there
1425.32s - 1431.56s |  that might feel some of those constraints that they could access. Yeah. I always tell people
1431.56s - 1437.80s |  whistleblowing is a last resort. You shouldn't really rely on like one David against a Goliath
1437.80s - 1442.44s |  for some of these issues. So the best way to help whistleblowers is usually to
1443.16s - 1449.40s |  figure out how to build the infrastructure to address concerns early because it's an incredibly
1449.40s - 1454.44s |  stressful process. I haven't met a single person that this hasn't deeply affected their families,
1455.08s - 1459.80s |  their mental health, their careers, their professions. It's an incredibly stressful
1459.80s - 1468.36s |  process that is very difficult to negotiate and navigate. So people who ever witnessed someone
1468.36s - 1472.68s |  in that position, the more support infrastructure you can build around those people, the better
1472.68s - 1477.96s |  they're going to fare. And then if they are, if you are in a position that you're reporting a
1477.96s - 1483.64s |  concern, the biggest piece of advice is try to find a lawyer, a lawyer, you can work on contingency
1483.64s - 1489.16s |  and not just the lawyer that your company provides because you need someone who's going to protect
1489.24s - 1494.60s |  your own interest and really show you the landscape of how you can appropriately protect yourself.
1495.24s - 1501.32s |  And then additionally to that, you know, there are lots of advocacy agencies, non-profits that are
1501.32s - 1507.40s |  here to help and to support people who are going through that tough process, whether it's
1507.40s - 1512.84s |  Whistleblowers of America, whether it's different regulatory agencies that have a Budsman's programs
1512.84s - 1518.04s |  that are meant to really support the people who are coming forward. But make sure you have a
1518.04s - 1523.56s |  good support network of the right people through it because it's really critical for people in that
1523.56s - 1531.00s |  position. Give it up. That's really great stuff. All right, we're going to shift back gears to some
1531.00s - 1537.88s |  medical devices. All right. There are no legacy medical devices in hospitals anymore. We fixed
1537.88s - 1545.00s |  the problem, right, Matt? You fix it? No. Oh, wow. I don't have trillions of dollars.
1545.88s - 1551.24s |  They're often cited as a major source of risk for hospitals. They have antiquated operating
1551.24s - 1557.08s |  systems, unpatched remote vulnerabilities. They're often deployed on super flat networks.
1557.88s - 1563.32s |  And this is not just a problem in rural America or poorly resourced hospitals. I mean, we see
1563.32s - 1570.36s |  similar types of really concerning implementations, deployments in larger hospitals as well, some of
1570.84s - 1576.44s |  which you might actually get care at. The question I have for here is talking about upgrade. And I
1576.44s - 1581.56s |  think this is going to be a really important thing to talk about. How can we take this problem of
1581.56s - 1589.40s |  patching legacy medical devices that should have, many people thought would have been solved by now,
1589.40s - 1593.00s |  like 20 years ago. You think people would have been like, oh, we're not going to be talking
1593.00s - 1598.12s |  about this at DEF CON 32 anymore. So clearly what we're doing isn't working. What's some new
1598.12s - 1602.84s |  approaches we can get at, Andrew, that I think would be a good opportunity for us to get into?
1603.48s - 1610.12s |  You're very kind, Christian. You're very kind. So yeah, the legacy medical device problem,
1610.12s - 1614.68s |  or the legacy device problem generally is especially problematic in healthcare because
1614.68s - 1621.32s |  of how many devices we use to provide care, to provide high quality care. And so getting the
1621.32s - 1626.92s |  most life out of a system that's still performant, right, there's a lot of value in that. But if the
1626.92s - 1631.08s |  security pieces of that, if the security or connectivity or interoperability elements of that
1631.64s - 1635.24s |  device, despite its ability to provide care, maintaining, you know, being sufficiently
1635.24s - 1640.60s |  performant, if it can't, maybe not, I would have, if you would ask me 15 years ago to
1641.72s - 1645.72s |  develop a device that would be safe from today's threats, I'd be like, nope, can't do that.
1646.68s - 1649.40s |  So, you know, how we think about this space.
1652.92s - 1653.96s |  Exactly, exactly.
1655.56s - 1657.24s |  Yeah, they're clapping for you.
1657.24s - 1659.32s |  Very nice. DEF CON next, everybody.
1661.80s - 1667.00s |  So I think, so you have this large complex ecosystem with lots of different vendors,
1667.00s - 1670.84s |  lots of different stakeholders, you have providers that are doing everything,
1670.84s - 1677.96s |  their focus should remain on care. I have a small aneurysm, every time someone tells me
1677.96s - 1684.60s |  that better training for clinicians will solve hospital cybersecurity, I flip the table, rage,
1684.60s - 1689.64s |  quit and leave immediately. Ideally, we want to get to a place where clinical staff don't think
1689.64s - 1695.00s |  about the cybersecurity of the systems they're dealing with. That's the dream. But we still have
1695.00s - 1700.44s |  this very complex, diverse tech ecosystem to deal with. And so how we do that, and how we do that
1700.44s - 1704.28s |  in a way that is context sensitive to each different clinical environment, to each different
1704.28s - 1709.48s |  department, that's not something that I've seen addressed in industry, kind of like enterprise
1709.48s - 1714.60s |  tooling, like does not hit the it's not looking at that problem space, because it's really hard.
1714.60s - 1718.52s |  And there's not necessarily like the upside, I think, to them from from an investment standpoint.
1719.16s - 1724.60s |  So at ARPA-H, we are looking at how we can invest and create the next generation of tools
1724.60s - 1729.88s |  to address that space, so that all of the hospitals, all the clinical environments in the
1729.88s - 1737.40s |  US can have like more performant care of their own kind of healthcare technology ecosystems. So we
1737.40s - 1741.32s |  can understand what's there kind of going back to this mapping question from earlier, you can't
1741.32s - 1746.76s |  defend what you can't find what you can't see. So how do we understand the environment? And then
1746.76s - 1752.68s |  how do we empower the IT staff, even if they're only one or two folks to engage with and manage
1752.68s - 1758.60s |  that environment in a super effective way? When they're dealing with, you know, hundreds or
1758.60s - 1762.52s |  thousands of devices across hundreds, potentially 10s to hundreds of vendors, like the configuration
1762.52s - 1770.76s |  management alone is a nightmare. So it's just incredibly kind of challenging stack of problems,
1770.76s - 1775.56s |  on top of the fact that if you make a mistake, or if your devices are out of commission,
1775.56s - 1779.80s |  like you increase the mortality of your patients every time you increase the delay to care.
1780.28s - 1784.84s |  And so, you know, we don't really have a choice but to do better in that space.
1784.84s - 1789.00s |  And so I'm really excited to see we've had a lot of engagement across healthcare providers,
1789.00s - 1793.40s |  across industry, you know, folks coming to the table with, you know, hey, we kind of had this
1793.40s - 1797.32s |  idea for this space. Let's let's see if we can make it work. Let's see if we can, you know,
1797.32s - 1802.68s |  make a huge dent in this in this challenge. So yeah, I'm very excited to kind of see what we
1802.68s - 1808.92s |  can do, because it really is a tremendous, like, just technical challenge. But I think I think
1809.24s - 1811.56s |  obviously, it's worth solving. Hell, yeah.
1813.96s - 1815.64s |  DEF CON next, everybody. DEF CON next.
1816.84s - 1820.60s |  All right, Matt, do you want to pick up a little bit where that left off from the legacy perspective
1820.60s - 1825.96s |  from, you know, not now as current FDA, but maybe in the past, right? Tell us a little bit about
1825.96s - 1829.16s |  what your guys's evolution of thinking has been around it around this.
1830.04s - 1838.04s |  Yeah. A lot of our effort has started in the healthcare sector coordinating council and in
1838.04s - 1844.76s |  the International Medical Device Regulators Forum, or FDA involvement, not our anymore.
1846.76s - 1853.64s |  It's vocal memory from eight and a half years there. It's hard to fight. But a lot of the
1853.64s - 1859.00s |  effort has been very collaborative, trying to get the healthcare perspective, the medical device
1859.00s - 1866.28s |  manufacturer perspective, as well as the regulator involvement. The legacy device problem is not
1866.28s - 1874.20s |  going away anytime soon, especially since FDA's statutory authority for cybersecurity just took
1874.20s - 1884.04s |  effect last year. It's going to take some time for those better devices to fully help prevent
1884.04s - 1892.76s |  some of the onset of the legacy device problem. A lot of what we see in response to some of the
1892.76s - 1899.24s |  issues to maintain continuity of care is, okay, well, we'll just make it not connected to the
1899.24s - 1906.52s |  Ethernet, and that removes a lot of our risk. But as we start to see devices evolve and additional
1906.52s - 1912.92s |  functionality being added, once you start doing that, you can start impacting some of the intended
1912.92s - 1918.12s |  use of that medical device and some of the core functionality that that device is providing.
1918.12s - 1923.48s |  So there's a greater cost to some of those mitigations that were available on older
1923.48s - 1929.32s |  products may no longer be available on some of the more recent products that are going out. So
1929.32s - 1938.04s |  it's a complex issue. It's also a regulated environment for updating and patching devices.
1938.04s - 1946.44s |  So making sure that addressing some of those challenges to make sure that the device is not
1946.44s - 1954.60s |  impacted by some of these updates to address some of the vulnerabilities, it's going to take
1954.60s - 1961.72s |  a kind of large collaborative effort to make sure that all of the nuances, the challenges,
1961.72s - 1968.20s |  and the best product for patients is what's ultimately achieved. Because at the end of the
1968.20s - 1973.40s |  day, that's always been FDA's mission while I worked there. It's always putting the patient
1973.40s - 1981.08s |  first and putting the patient's top of mind in all of our approaches. But the legacy device
1981.08s - 1987.80s |  challenge is just one that's going to take a lot of government coordination as well as a lot of
1987.80s - 1992.84s |  coordination across healthcare facilities and the medical device manufacturer community
1993.96s - 1999.64s |  in order to get to workable solutions, not just for what's out there today, but also
2000.36s - 2006.20s |  to maintain the devices that are currently out there and going to be going out there because
2006.76s - 2014.04s |  the medical device lifecycle is so different than traditional tech. Clinicians will use a device
2014.04s - 2020.92s |  until it no longer physically functions, and that's a hard place to secure. So it's just
2021.48s - 2027.48s |  addressing all of those challenges and finding the right solutions and fixes.
2028.04s - 2031.00s |  Fantastic. And I'm going to put you on the spot. I didn't tell you about this question,
2031.00s - 2036.36s |  so it's not. But I'm sure that healthcare is the only sector that you have to deal with that has
2036.36s - 2041.08s |  this legacy problem, right? It's only healthcare. There are no lessons learned or stuff you've
2041.08s - 2046.52s |  figured out from other sectors that we could apply here. Sarcasm. I mean, I'm assuming this
2046.52s - 2050.92s |  is not a unique problem to healthcare. We talk about it a lot, but what are you seeing across
2050.92s - 2054.68s |  other sectors that maybe we could learn a little bit from the healthcare side?
2054.68s - 2058.44s |  I think it's not unique to the sector, which is probably a good thing and also a scary thing
2058.44s - 2065.56s |  to some extent. What do we see across the board? I see a lot of Windows 95. I see a lot of Clippy
2065.56s - 2071.24s |  from Office, who I'm a fan of Clippy. I want to bring Clippy back, but we really need to look at
2071.24s - 2074.68s |  what the next generation looks like. We've seen this in food and agriculture. We've seen this in
2074.68s - 2078.76s |  the water sector. We've seen this in every sector as we go across the board. Because I think there's
2078.76s - 2084.28s |  still a perception in most organizations that cybersecurity is a nuisance versus a good thing.
2084.28s - 2089.16s |  Versus a necessity. We need to make that pivot and get people to realize that this isn't just
2089.16s - 2094.68s |  about being an inconvenience or taking down a unit or part of your organization for a period of time
2094.68s - 2100.44s |  so we can upgrade or patch, but it's a necessity to ensure the prompt and accurate and strong
2100.44s - 2104.84s |  delivery of care and safe delivery of care. Well, frankly, also if people are looking at this
2104.84s - 2109.56s |  really from a numbers perspective, it is in the best interest of an organization in the long run
2109.56s - 2114.76s |  to take these steps early on. This is something we're seeing across the board,
2114.76s - 2119.00s |  but it's frankly something that we need to change the entire landscape of how we're talking
2119.00s - 2123.96s |  with everybody from CISOs to clinical personnel in the healthcare sector, but to CEOs and boards
2123.96s - 2128.68s |  of directors to understand that we need to make this pivot from nuisance to necessity
2128.68s - 2132.76s |  when it comes to patching, upgrading, and frankly cybersecurity at large.
2132.76s - 2137.72s |  We've made some progress. I talk to a lot of healthcare CEOs these days that are talking
2137.72s - 2141.72s |  to me about their attack surface, which frankly the fact that those two words are coming out of
2141.72s - 2146.12s |  their mouth in that order is a wonderful thing. It means that they are acknowledging the fact
2146.12s - 2149.56s |  that this is an issue. The fact that they know who their CISOs are and they're having these
2149.56s - 2154.28s |  conversations is a huge step forward, but it's only the tip of the iceberg when you look at the
2154.28s - 2161.16s |  breadth and scope of the healthcare sector of where we need to go. Awesome. All right,
2161.16s - 2165.40s |  so who here feels a little ... I mean, I promise we started at cake. Now we're talking about
2165.40s - 2170.44s |  depressing stuff, but I'm trying to bounce it back up a little bit and say, how many of you
2170.44s - 2177.00s |  out there would volunteer with the skills you have as a hacker to try to make this problem
2177.00s - 2181.16s |  better? Raise your hand. Yeah, that's awesome. I hope to see almost all your hands in the future.
2181.16s - 2186.84s |  Many of you are already, but let's talk about what you can do a little bit or maybe where
2187.96s - 2192.12s |  I think in some sense we've seen some great growth in hackers involved in this,
2192.12s - 2197.48s |  and maybe we can do a little bit more. So it's been over 15 years of great medical device
2197.48s - 2204.04s |  cybersecurity research. Devices like pacemakers, insulin pumps, all sorts of stuff has been shown
2204.04s - 2209.32s |  at places like this. Barnaby Jack, Jay Radcliffe, Billy Rios and others, these are names that we
2209.32s - 2215.88s |  talk about at DEF CON and Black Hat, and they contributed to these tremendous leaps in what
2215.88s - 2219.72s |  happened at the FDA or what happened in the national conversation about medical device
2219.72s - 2224.92s |  cybersecurity, and that came from folks like you. It came from hackers. You guys did something,
2224.92s - 2231.00s |  you showed others, and it caused some amazing action to happen. But stuff's kind of changed a
2231.00s - 2236.68s |  little bit. Anyone seen a really good medical device, uh, hack on, on a big stage at Black
2236.68s - 2243.48s |  Hat or DEF CON recently? No. The question I have is we have great spaces like the Biohacking
2243.48s - 2246.36s |  Village. If you haven't had a chance to check it out, you definitely should, where hackers
2246.36s - 2251.08s |  get their hands on medical devices. But do we need to do more? Do we need to be giving more
2251.08s - 2256.92s |  medical devices, more exposure to the folks in this room that have that power, and maybe do
2257.64s - 2264.76s |  what Jay and Kevin Fu and others did 10 years ago to change things? So to the, to the audience,
2264.76s - 2269.88s |  what should we do? How do we get these folks out here more engaged in medical devices or healthcare
2269.88s - 2277.08s |  cybersecurity infrastructure or whistleblower? I mean, I think if, uh, if Apple could provide
2277.08s - 2280.84s |  security researchers with devices, even if there is, you know, some rigmarole to get, to get access
2280.84s - 2285.72s |  to them, um, the idea that you could get access to firmware for medical devices, the model that
2285.72s - 2289.80s |  the Biohacking Village has started, um, feels like something that we can scale and we could scale
2289.80s - 2294.76s |  and have a significant impact, um, and do it, doing it really in a very, once again, very collaborative
2294.76s - 2299.72s |  way. Like there is so much good intent and so much capability in this community, um, and reward that
2300.28s - 2305.40s |  success in that space. Uh, and just the, the dividends would be tremendous across the sector.
2305.40s - 2308.76s |  Um, and I think the, the upfront investment actually wouldn't necessarily be significant
2308.76s - 2313.08s |  if we choose to take that action, right? Like it's, it's fundamentally a choice that we need
2313.08s - 2319.40s |  to make first, um, across regulators, uh, manufacturers, uh, research agencies. But
2319.40s - 2322.84s |  you know, if we make that choice, we commit a little bit and like, I think we will see
2322.84s - 2326.84s |  massive returns very quickly. Um, so let's make that choice.
2328.84s - 2335.16s |  So I'd say from the medical device perspective, there's a great benefit in that the new
2335.16s - 2341.08s |  statutory requirements for connected medical devices includes that the manufacturer has to
2341.08s - 2347.96s |  have a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process, um, so that it should become easier
2348.04s - 2355.00s |  to access people at the company. If you're able to, um, identify potential vulnerabilities in a
2355.00s - 2363.00s |  product, I will say one of the challenges and one of the, uh, things that the people that you named,
2363.00s - 2371.24s |  um, had a immense amount of patience, um, especially for the older products that take
2371.24s - 2380.52s |  longer to patch that had, uh, older devices, uh, devices that don't have as easy delivery
2380.52s - 2388.36s |  mechanisms for patching and updates, um, in order to ensure patient safety in that responsible
2388.36s - 2395.16s |  disclosure of the vulnerabilities. Sometimes those take time, um, in order to process and develop,
2395.16s - 2399.48s |  have the manufacturer develop patches to address the issues.
2399.48s - 2405.56s |  Uh, but now that coordinated vulnerability disclosure is a requirement for new products,
2405.56s - 2410.76s |  that should become a easier process, but definitely keep in mind that there is that
2410.76s - 2418.44s |  patient safety aspect, um, that may take, cause the disclosure to take a little longer than you
2418.44s - 2425.32s |  would like. Um, but you can still go through the process, still, um, engage with the manufacturer,
2425.32s - 2430.60s |  still get the appropriate credit and while maintaining that patient safety consideration.
2431.88s - 2435.48s |  Just a, just kind of a follow-up to that. I think talking to folks in the security research
2435.48s - 2439.96s |  community, uh, especially if we're looking at like academic research, access to devices is the
2439.96s - 2444.28s |  number one reason that we don't, I think, see more work in this space. Um, and there are a lot of
2444.28s - 2450.20s |  cons- they're clapping for you, but they're next door. Not everyone at DefCon is clapping
2450.20s - 2457.24s |  for me while I'm talking. I appreciate the vibe though. Um, uh, like if you don't have access to
2457.24s - 2462.44s |  any of the kind of artifacts of a device, it is very hard to assess its security properties.
2462.44s - 2468.36s |  Um, and I think that's where we see, I mean, if, if, if, you know, controlling the, the ecosystem,
2468.36s - 2473.00s |  um, may be disadvantageous in the long run or, or, or limiting access, like, like the
2474.12s - 2479.16s |  providing more avenues for controlled access or, or just identifying what level of control
2479.16s - 2483.72s |  is actually necessary to maintain whatever interest you have in devices safety in your
2483.72s - 2489.80s |  own business, whatever. Um, I think reassessing kind of those, those parameters, uh, and then
2489.80s - 2495.32s |  engaging more with the community, uh, like, like grad students can do a whole lot of really good
2495.32s - 2500.36s |  work for, you know, not a whole lot of money. Like thank, thank the NSF and NIH. Like, like we
2500.36s - 2504.60s |  can see via their work in other spaces, in other sectors, even other critical infrastructure
2504.60s - 2509.24s |  sectors. So we have the ability, we have the talent and we know kind of what it costs. Um,
2509.24s - 2514.36s |  so I think unleashing and kind of like building more work in that space could be a very cost
2514.36s - 2520.36s |  effective, um, and also security effective way of getting more, more kind of progress, uh, here.
2520.36s - 2524.84s |  But once again, it requires the choice to kind of open yourself up to that, that relationship and
2524.84s - 2528.60s |  that community. Um, so yeah, that's, that's something that I spent a lot of time thinking
2528.60s - 2532.76s |  about because you're right, right? We don't see that a lot. Like the biohacking village, very
2532.76s - 2536.68s |  unique kind of in this respect, or, or there are other efforts across the nation. I'm not trying
2536.68s - 2542.76s |  to discount those, but, um, we could do more. Absolutely. I, you shouldn't have to hack on
2542.76s - 2549.72s |  your own medical device that you own because, and that helps you be alive to do cool cutting
2549.72s - 2556.84s |  edge research, right? You shouldn't have to go on eBay and buy the only device available for you
2556.84s - 2561.32s |  in a device category that's 10 years old or 15 years old and has, of course you're going to find
2561.32s - 2565.72s |  stuff because you can't get your hands on the latest and greatest. You know, I really wonder
2565.72s - 2572.20s |  if that's holding us back. And it's just then a game of if I could get ahold of it, I could find
2572.20s - 2576.12s |  something, but I'm not going to, and it's going to just float along. We miss an opportunity to
2576.12s - 2581.56s |  really make some meaningful change earlier. Um, so that's a plea to the plea to the audience,
2581.56s - 2584.76s |  get involved. Who would, who would take a medical device home and wrench on it if he could?
2585.32s - 2591.32s |  Yeah. Hell yeah. No drug delivery pumps for you guys though. Okay. No fentanyl pumps. All right.
2592.76s - 2601.24s |  All right. Consolidation. Okay. Here we go. Smaller. Uh, give me a round. I want an audience
2601.24s - 2605.24s |  poll real quick. Raise your hand. If you think the profit margins of most hospitals in this
2605.24s - 2615.64s |  country is over 20%, raise your hand. All right. Keep your hand up. 10%. 5%. 1%. Yeah. You guys
2615.64s - 2622.84s |  know it's about 1% sub 1% meaning your hospital makes a profit margin probably between one and
2622.84s - 2629.24s |  4%. And then if they don't, if they screw something up, they go red. More and more hospitals are
2629.24s - 2634.04s |  getting financially distressed. And I want to just hear if anyone in this audience knows what
2634.04s - 2639.48s |  happens. You have a hospital system, it's in the red. And then what is it going to do to survive?
2639.48s - 2646.28s |  Is it going to see more patients or become more efficient? No, it's going to get bought.
2647.32s - 2654.04s |  It's going to get consolidated. What happens when hospital system A buys hospital system B?
2654.04s - 2658.60s |  Do you think they're going to have two different, uh, entire technology stacks? No, they're going
2658.60s - 2665.08s |  to unify under one stack, right? What happens when more and more hospitals are just part of
2665.08s - 2671.08s |  more and more mega healthcare delivery organization conglomerates and one of them gets hit? And then
2671.08s - 2677.40s |  not only is it then one or two hospitals that are down, it's 200 over four states. The question I
2677.40s - 2682.04s |  have is from a national security perspective, as something that we should do from folks that are
2682.04s - 2686.12s |  interested in this, making sure hospitals can function, you know, how should we look at the
2686.12s - 2690.92s |  consolidation of healthcare delivery organizations when it comes to risk of catastrophic failure?
2690.92s - 2696.76s |  And is there anything we can do when hospital systems try to marry one another that could
2696.76s - 2702.68s |  limit this? So to the panel. Also, I'll offer, I think we are looking at this and having a lot of
2702.68s - 2706.76s |  conversations about really understanding risk. I think we look at risk in not necessarily the
2706.76s - 2711.88s |  right light when it comes to cybersecurity. I look at risk as a three-legged stool. There's risk
2711.88s - 2715.64s |  identification. We spend a lot of time on that. There's risk mitigation. We spend a lot of time
2715.64s - 2720.52s |  on that. The third leg of the stool is risk acceptance. And we don't spend enough time
2720.52s - 2725.72s |  understanding the risks that we're accepting in our organizations by not investing in
2725.72s - 2730.60s |  cybersecurity or modernization and infrastructure. That risk acceptance is not the CISO.
2731.24s - 2735.96s |  That risk acceptance is the CEOs and the boards of directors of organizations that are deciding
2735.96s - 2742.68s |  to not invest. I get the margins issue. I worked in healthcare. We were never even in the one percent,
2742.68s - 2745.48s |  so I think that's a great... We would have loved to have been in the one percent.
2746.84s - 2751.40s |  So I think that there's those types of challenges that folks are balancing against, but people need
2751.40s - 2755.72s |  to understand the risks that they're accepting. I will say that we are hearing more healthcare
2755.72s - 2762.20s |  organizations talking about tech debt and cyber risk in the M&A process. They're having these
2762.20s - 2766.60s |  discussions of saying, we want to buy this healthcare system or this hospital, and we know
2766.60s - 2772.36s |  that it's going to cost us 2 million, 3 million, 4 million to get their IT to the standards that we
2772.36s - 2777.32s |  have set within our organization. And they're building that into the M&A discussion when it
2777.32s - 2781.72s |  comes to that. Now, that being said, that's a small fraction of the conversations that are
2781.72s - 2785.08s |  happening. So I think it's a multi-pronged approach. One, we want to make sure that we're
2785.08s - 2790.60s |  able to get that message out to folks and change the way that we're looking at M&A within healthcare
2790.60s - 2796.04s |  so that people are factoring in tech debt and cybersecurity as part of that dialogue. And I
2796.04s - 2800.28s |  think the other piece of it is making sure that we understand, going back to the first question
2800.28s - 2805.40s |  about mapping out the sector, where are those key dependencies where something is, you know,
2806.12s - 2811.56s |  we know this with the HR, we know this obviously with change, but there's other types of events
2811.56s - 2816.68s |  that we don't know what's out there, where there's these entities that have such large market share
2816.68s - 2821.32s |  that the impact of one becomes an impact to more than we can tolerate in healthcare. We need to
2821.32s - 2826.52s |  know that so we can start having those discussions of buying down that risk or going in collectively
2826.52s - 2830.92s |  and accepting that risk. And we have not been able to do that effectively yet where we need to
2830.92s - 2840.30s |  in the healthcare sector. Oh, mergers and acquisitions. Sorry. Thank you. Anyone else?
2841.66s - 2849.66s |  I'd say, in terms of consolidation, I'd say, what can we learn from other international models
2849.66s - 2856.94s |  where there are single payer systems that have large networks of facilities? Are there things
2856.94s - 2862.38s |  that we can learn to address some of those risks based off of what we've seen them do well or them
2862.38s - 2869.66s |  have issues with? And how can we adopt what has worked well or improve upon what hasn't?
2870.94s - 2877.34s |  But I'd say it's definitely something we need to pay careful attention to and see what protections
2877.90s - 2885.50s |  can be in place to isolate facilities in case one gets hit, to ensure that continuity of care,
2885.50s - 2891.98s |  especially if it's in an overlapping region, you don't want to lose an entire region of facilities
2893.50s - 2900.62s |  based off of it hitting the central core facility or just affecting the entire network.
2900.62s - 2908.62s |  So how can we get better detection and automated response capabilities in order
2908.62s - 2914.52s |  to cut off those networks when exposed? All right. I want to make sure we can get
2914.52s - 2918.36s |  through some questions here. And this has a whistleblower component, I think,
2918.36s - 2921.80s |  which is the interesting part. I'd like to pull on that a little bit in here.
2923.96s - 2928.68s |  For years, we have known very little in what happens inside hospitals that have been hit
2928.68s - 2934.12s |  with ransomware. Every once in a while, you'll get a news report that says an attack happened,
2934.12s - 2938.12s |  and you'll hear some updated news reports that the attack's still going on. Maybe you'll get
2938.12s - 2942.84s |  an anonymous quote from a doctor or nurse that worked at the hospital. But for longest times,
2942.84s - 2947.48s |  we had no idea, really, with rare exception. Maybe, I'm just going to shout out University
2947.48s - 2951.80s |  of Vermont, right? They've been incredibly transparent in their attack. Well, as a
2951.80s - 2957.80s |  consequence of not sharing that information very openly and exhaustively is we don't get lessons
2957.80s - 2962.12s |  learned, right? We don't know what happened when they're taking care of their diabetic patients
2962.12s - 2967.80s |  that were in a crisis or their heart attacks or their strokes. We don't really learn like we
2967.80s - 2974.44s |  should. And there are some organizations like ISACs and these types of things. But clearly,
2975.00s - 2985.07s |  there seems to be an information vacuum. Do we offer some additional legal protections,
2985.07s - 2990.43s |  some type of additional efforts that we can do to make health systems feel more comfortable about
2990.43s - 2995.87s |  talking about their failures so other people can learn from it? To the audience, or sorry,
2995.87s - 3002.59s |  to the panel. So, I think you see in other domains where people make upfront disclosures
3002.59s - 3007.71s |  that say if they are in violation of some sort of tenant, like foreign corrupt practices,
3007.71s - 3013.07s |  that there will be leniencies in terms of the fees that they might incur. But I think it is
3013.07s - 3018.19s |  to this point of like getting that board buy-in, getting that executive buy-in to say like mistakes
3018.19s - 3023.39s |  are going to be made and we're here to fix them. And that there's an immense amount of power
3023.47s - 3029.39s |  in deconstructing the narrative of exactly what went wrong and the details of that. Because even
3029.39s - 3034.43s |  for a cybersecurity failure, it's not just one or two things. It's probably a list of
3034.43s - 3041.07s |  30 different decisions that were made. And being able to have really clear granularity
3041.07s - 3048.59s |  of who made what decisions, who was affected, who was unaware, whatever those details are,
3048.59s - 3054.51s |  being very explicit, very clear, and really being able to dig in the weeds of those retrospective
3054.51s - 3060.35s |  analysis. And not only sharing them internally with those organizations, but also externally
3060.99s - 3067.15s |  to other people who work in the cybersecurity industry is immensely helpful. But I think
3067.15s - 3073.71s |  psychologically very hard, right? It's hard even though you may be valued by other cybersecurity
3073.71s - 3079.31s |  professionals for being transparent and open and admitting a mistake. The public perception
3079.31s - 3085.63s |  of that could be seen while you were in negligent or everything else. And that sort of shift
3085.63s - 3091.87s |  in people's perception of when people make mistakes is also a bit of a challenge there.
3091.87s - 3096.03s |  So you can see that there's maybe some sort of incentivization structure that you can create to
3096.03s - 3100.99s |  say you'll get leniency if you're very clear at reporting what went wrong and how it went wrong
3100.99s - 3107.15s |  in very, very specified details. Or alternatively, again, it's like this is a deliberate decision
3108.03s - 3112.75s |  typically by people in positions of leadership to say transparency is important to us.
3112.75s - 3118.19s |  Being able to say we are engineers, we are going to fail, that is a nature of engineering, but we
3118.19s - 3124.59s |  are also here to fix. And this is how we fixed it. And for the benefit of our industry, here is the
3124.59s - 3131.79s |  details of how we resolved that issue. And I think having those case studies is crucially
3131.79s - 3137.39s |  important for basically any field that you're really in. But it's a tricky problem, right?
3137.39s - 3144.43s |  Because it's a public perception, it's a liability issue or a perceived liability issue. And it's
3144.43s - 3150.51s |  like how do you overcome those hurdles is more of a people problem I would see than a technical
3151.47s - 3157.31s |  problem. Yeah, it's been a technical problem at the end of the day.
3158.99s - 3164.83s |  I think kind of building on that, like looking at the FAA and how we deal with aviation incidents,
3164.83s - 3169.47s |  I mean, I think there was a recognition that the entire industry, like if people did not feel safe
3169.47s - 3174.83s |  flying, that entire sector would collapse. And so the need for transparency, the processes that
3174.83s - 3179.87s |  have been put in place, like are they perfect? Probably not. I'm not an expert in that field.
3179.87s - 3183.31s |  But there is a high degree of industry and government cooperation. There's a high degree
3183.31s - 3190.75s |  of transparency. There's a high degree of forensic capacity built into the systems that we use to
3190.75s - 3197.95s |  ensure commercial flight. Or like the NTSB to a lesser degree. But things that we have decided
3197.95s - 3204.75s |  are necessary for the economy, for the nation to move forward every day. We find a way to achieve
3204.75s - 3208.99s |  more transparency and more cooperation. And so it'd be really interesting just to see
