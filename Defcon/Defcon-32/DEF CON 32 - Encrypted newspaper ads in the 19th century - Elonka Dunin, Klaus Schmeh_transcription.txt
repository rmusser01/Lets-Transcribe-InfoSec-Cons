  "title": "DEF CON 32 - Encrypted newspaper ads in the 19th century - Elonka Dunin, Klaus Schmeh",
  "description": "Between 1850 and 1855, the London-based newspaper The Times published over 50 encrypted advertisements apparently intended for the same recipient. As we know today, the ads in that series were meant for the sea captain Richard Collinson, who at the time was on a mission in the Canadian Arctic trying to solve a captivating mystery: What happened to the lost John Franklin expedition? While Collinson never reached his goal, he established a secure worldwide communication system, which was unique for its time.\n\nBefore his departure, Collinson's family was taught how to encrypt brief reports about what was going on at home and to publish these messages as mysterious ads in \u201cThe Times\u201d once a month. The cipher used was a modified version of a system based on a signal-book of the Royal Navy. As the circulation of The Times stretched far beyond the UK, Collinson would have the chance to get his hands on a copy even at the remotest of ports.\n\nOver a century later, the Collinson ads were finally broken in the 1990s. Over the last two years, the lecturers of this talk continued this work, with a goal of decrypting all of the ads and placing them in their appropriate geographic and cultural context.",

 Welcome. So, it's a pleasure to be back at DEF CON. It's been a few years. Today, we're
6.24s - 15.24s |  going to talk about encrypted ads from the 19th century. And my name is Ilan Kadunin.
15.24s - 24.08s |  Hello, and my name is Klaus Schmee. I'm a German computer scientist. I work for a company
24.08s - 33.24s |  named Eviden, a European IT security company. I'm also a crypto and crypto history expert.
33.24s - 38.84s |  And we have written a couple of books together. Most recently, this one came out in September
38.84s - 49.08s |  2023 from No Starch Press. And if you go down to the east vendor hall, number 29, they may
49.08s - 55.88s |  have one copy left. At least, that's what we saw when we checked earlier. So, encrypted
55.88s - 63.22s |  newspaper ads. Just kind of giving you a general idea. This is something that was very popular
63.22s - 69.52s |  in the 19th century. Usually, they were sent back and forth between lovers. Sometimes they
69.52s - 74.92s |  were used for business reasons. And there were a couple of books that were written.
74.92s - 82.60s |  This is one from 2006 by Gene Palmer. It was the pseudonym for Tony Gaffney. And he
82.60s - 89.76s |  lists about 1,000 of these ads. Many of them have been solved. Not all of them. He doesn't
89.76s - 96.56s |  provide solutions for all of them. And here's a couple more. You can see. And the one on
96.56s - 102.64s |  the right we thought was interesting because it had an encrypted section at the top. And
102.64s - 110.48s |  then at the bottom, it said, this will be intelligible if read in connection with my
110.48s - 120.36s |  communication published in this column on the 8th instrument this month. So, we went
120.36s - 128.80s |  back and we checked. And it gave us no clues. It does look like it's a transposition
128.80s - 136.96s |  cipher. But this one remains unsolved. Here are a couple other interesting ones. This one
136.96s - 149.86s |  sort of looks like a Bible code. Also unsolved. And these two clearly related between tissy
149.86s - 159.86s |  and jabber. Also unsolved. And here's a colleague of ours, D.J. Mueller. He decided to look
159.86s - 168.14s |  in the French newspaper, Le Figaro, and he found thousands of encrypted ads in the French
168.14s - 174.06s |  language, at least of the ones he could solve. We actually met him a few weeks ago in
174.06s - 183.10s |  Switzerland. And he has this lovely database. He has found so far, looking at the years
183.10s - 195.37s |  from 1875 to 1896, 3,700 cipher messages. Only 62% have been broken so far. Here are a
195.37s - 210.86s |  couple. And this one was interesting because you can tell if you dig into it, it's a
210.86s - 217.30s |  combination of what we call clear text. And then if you look at the numbers in between, it's
217.30s - 223.66s |  all five digit numbers. And someone into codes will go, aha, well, that looks like a
223.66s - 230.58s |  code book code. But we haven't found which code book. We've looked at the code books from
230.58s - 236.10s |  that time period. There are some in French and some in English. But haven't found
236.10s - 241.54s |  anything that works. It's possible that we haven't found the right code book. It's
241.54s - 247.86s |  possible that there's some sort of super encryption going on. So, you know, take a five
247.86s - 252.66s |  digit code and you add one to it or divide it by two or something like that. But for whatever
252.66s - 262.82s |  reason, we haven't found it. Now, this one is a musical mystery. Ce qu'on ne peut se dire ni
262.82s - 269.82s |  s'Ã©crire, on peut le chanter. Do mi, do mi, do re, re fa, re fa, re mi, et cetera, et
269.82s - 278.70s |  cetera. Vous avez compris? Which in English means that which cannot be said nor written can be
278.70s - 284.42s |  sung. And then we put what we think are the notes there and have you have have you
284.42s - 292.66s |  understood. So, then we also mapped it to a musical staff here. We didn't have any
292.66s - 299.30s |  indication of, you know, what the signature was or the duration of the notes. So, we just kind
299.30s - 312.54s |  of picked something that seemed to fit. And if sound works, we'll play it for you. Makes it
312.54s - 317.94s |  much more clear. I'm going to play it once more so you can kind of map it to the do mi, do mi,
317.94s - 330.74s |  do re. So, there's a couple things that could be going on here. One is that it could be related
330.74s - 337.90s |  to a language called Solresol, which had been invented in France a little earlier by a Frenchman.
337.90s - 344.70s |  It was an artificial language that was based on notes. So, I went and I looked for anyone today
344.70s - 351.18s |  that might know Solresol. I went on Discord. You can find everything on Discord. So, I found a
351.18s - 356.14s |  Solresol community and I asked them if they could read it, if they could understand it. And they
356.14s - 360.06s |  said no. And I said, well, if it means anything, it's probably like, I love you, I miss you, why
360.06s - 365.46s |  haven't you written to me? And they said no. They still couldn't understand it. So, it's also
365.46s - 372.42s |  possible. I have some fans that are into classical music and they said, you know, this sounds like a
372.42s - 379.90s |  practice at the beginning of choir. What the choir, the singers will use to kind of get in shape for
379.90s - 388.58s |  the choir. So, maybe all this means is see you soon at choir practice. We don't know. There's just a
388.58s - 395.78s |  lot of theories on it. So, this one still remains officially unsolved. There are many more encrypted
395.78s - 401.94s |  ads. Again, most of them are from the late 19th century. Most are broken. Some are not. And
401.98s - 404.10s |  there's still a lot of research being done on it.
406.86s - 414.70s |  Okay, let's now look at a series of encrypted newspaper ads from the 19th century. All of these
414.70s - 423.10s |  were published in the Times. There were over 50 of these newspaper ads. Here you see one. It was
423.10s - 433.02s |  published in 1853. If we have a closer look, this one is the same. We clearly see that it is
433.02s - 443.30s |  encrypted. And there's no obvious way to decipher this message. So, it's certainly not clear what it
443.30s - 454.62s |  means. Let's now go ahead for 130 years to the year 1980. In 1980, the Times, so the same
454.66s - 461.18s |  newspaper, published one of these messages again. Apparently, they didn't realize that there was a
461.18s - 467.74s |  whole series of these messages. So, they only found one. And they wondered what it meant. And so,
467.74s - 475.06s |  they published it. And they challenged their readers to solve it. But there was no success. So,
475.06s - 482.34s |  apparently, none of the Times readers in 1980 was able to break this encryption. The only thing
482.34s - 491.70s |  that was found out is that these numbers and letters that are marked here probably referred to latitude
491.70s - 500.02s |  and longitude. And it leads to a place in northern Canada. Well, this is certainly unusual because in
500.02s - 509.94s |  the 1850s, not very many people traveled to northern Canada. So, this is certainly unusual. And one
509.94s - 517.22s |  reader of the Times in 1980 suspected, well, this might have got to do with the Franklin edition. I
517.22s - 524.18s |  don't know if you're familiar with the Franklin edition. Sorry, with the Franklin expedition. But if
524.18s - 527.74s |  you're not, Ilanka is going to tell you what it was.
529.14s - 538.50s |  So, the Franklin expedition. This was one of the great mysteries of the late 1800s. So, there was Lord
538.58s - 547.78s |  John Franklin. And he started an expedition in 1845. It was a British naval expedition. He had
547.78s - 554.18s |  two ships. They were called the Terror and the Erebus. The reason they had these names is because
554.18s - 560.18s |  originally they had been warships. And the theory was is that because they were warships and they
560.18s - 568.42s |  were built very, very strongly, that they would be able to be good icebreakers going into the
568.42s - 577.06s |  ice packs above north of Canada. The goal was to find this northwest passage. So, instead of going
577.06s - 584.98s |  south around South America, was it possible to go north, northwest, and get to Asia that way?
585.54s - 594.58s |  So, this particular expedition, they set off from England from great fanfare. They stopped off in
594.58s - 602.26s |  Greenland to get some supplies and to offload a couple of sailors who had fallen ill. And then
602.26s - 613.36s |  they headed west across the Baffin Bay and vanished. Nothing was heard from them. No one else
613.36s - 622.40s |  saw them. Now, it was a five-year mission. So, it wasn't entirely surprising. But a couple years
622.40s - 631.92s |  went by and then Lady Franklin started beating the drum and, hey, where's my husband? And so,
631.92s - 640.80s |  she was going to the Admiralty and demanding that they set off some search expeditions, find out
640.80s - 651.76s |  what had happened to these two ships. So, nothing was found from them. And it was actually 150 years
651.76s - 662.48s |  later that the ships were finally found, right? 150? Yeah. So, in 2014 and 2016, the ships were located
663.28s - 670.00s |  off of King William Island. The Terror was found in the coincidentally named Terror Bay.
670.64s - 677.76s |  And then south of it was the Erebus. Now, many books have been written about the Franklin
677.76s - 684.56s |  expedition because it was this great mystery of why did they disappear? Had aliens come down
684.56s - 691.92s |  and got them? Or had they, you know, some sort of sea monster had sunk their ships? So, basically,
691.92s - 697.92s |  anyone who wanted could come up with any theory that they wanted. And as I said, there were many
697.92s - 704.16s |  different rescue expeditions that were sent. There was this great reward that was offered. This is
704.16s - 712.72s |  just a few of the expeditions. There were many more. And now, let's come back to that classified ad.
713.36s - 720.64s |  Did it have anything to do with the Franklin expedition? Was there some relationship between
720.64s - 726.24s |  the ad and the Franklin expedition or the ad and one of the rescue expeditions?
728.64s - 737.04s |  Yes. So, let's now come back to this article in the Times in 1980 when the readers were
737.04s - 744.80s |  challenged to break this encrypted advertisement from the 1850s. Well, as I said, in 1980,
744.80s - 751.60s |  nobody was able to solve this mystery. But 12 years later, this article was published by
751.84s - 759.52s |  British encryption expert named John Rapson. He published this article in Cryptoloja, which is
760.80s - 766.48s |  a scientific journal dedicated to crypto history mainly. And in this article, he
768.00s - 775.44s |  introduced the solution of this mystery. So, this is the advertisement he looked at.
776.00s - 783.20s |  And when he analyzed this advertisement, well, he saw it mainly consists of four letter groups
784.48s - 793.28s |  and of some three letter groups. And the letters used here or the lowercase letters all run from
793.28s - 799.92s |  G to Q, excluding the J, which means that there are 10 different lowercase letters used here.
800.00s - 808.08s |  There are also a couple of capital letters running from B to F. And in addition, the S was used.
808.72s - 814.80s |  And there was also some clear text in this message. For example, the signature at the end,
815.76s - 819.84s |  JEDW is clearly not an encryption. It's an abbreviation.
821.60s - 827.04s |  Well, if one is familiar with the encryption systems used in the 19th century,
827.04s - 832.96s |  it's quite obvious that a codebook was used here, or it's at least very likely. Ilanka has
833.68s - 839.04s |  introduced a few, or at least one advertisement that was apparently encrypted with a codebook.
839.76s - 845.76s |  And this is not a new situation for codebreakers because many codebook encrypted messages were
845.76s - 852.40s |  created over the centuries. And the best way to break a codebook encrypted message is usually
852.64s - 861.84s |  to find the codebook that was used. Not very surprising, but this method usually very often
861.84s - 868.40s |  works quite well because there were not too many codebooks in use, at least if you know when a
868.40s - 874.72s |  message was created and who created it. You usually can tell, well, if it was in the military, maybe
874.72s - 881.52s |  it was a military codebook of the time, or if it was some business-related, maybe it was a business
881.52s - 887.92s |  codebook. A codebook can be imagined like a dictionary, so for every word of a language,
887.92s - 897.60s |  there's a number or maybe a sequence of letters. And many ciphertexts have been solved by finding
897.60s - 904.64s |  the codebook that was used. So the question John Rapson asked himself was, well, is there a
904.64s - 911.20s |  codebook or was there a codebook at the time in question that used four letter groups based on
911.20s - 919.44s |  the letters from G to Q? And the answer was no, or at least we and John Rapson didn't know of a
919.44s - 927.04s |  codebook that matched this requirement. But the letters from G to Q, excluding the J, make exactly
927.04s - 934.56s |  ten letters. So maybe the letters were used instead of digits. So maybe the G stands for zero
934.56s - 941.36s |  and the H for one and so on. And in fact, John Rapson found a codebook that was a very good
941.36s - 949.04s |  match. It was the so-called Marriott Signal Code. It was introduced in 1817. There were several
949.04s - 958.72s |  editions and it was quite popular in the 1850s in England. So this looked like a good guess. If
958.72s - 964.96s |  you look into this codebook, you see that it was created for sending a signal or flag signal
964.96s - 971.36s |  messages. This is not relevant here. We are not dealing with flags, but it could also be used for
971.36s - 978.36s |  any other kind of messages as long as such a message could be noted in digits from zero to nine.
978.52s - 986.52s |  Here on the right you see an excerpt from this codebook. So as I said, it's like a dictionary and
986.52s - 992.60s |  this one replaces every word of the English language with a number between zero, zero, zero, zero
992.60s - 1002.60s |  and nine, nine, nine, nine. Okay, so what did Rapson do? Well, he took one of the advertisements and
1002.60s - 1010.60s |  replaced every four-digit word, every letter in a four-digit word with the numbers from zero to
1010.60s - 1018.20s |  nine with the table you can see here, the substitution table you can see here. And then he
1018.20s - 1025.08s |  applied the codebook, the Marriott codebook, and what did he get? Nothing. Or at least nothing that
1025.08s - 1033.88s |  really looked like meaningful text. So maybe the mistake was that the replacement table running
1033.88s - 1043.08s |  from zero to nine was wrong. It was certainly a difficult question what else or which other table
1043.08s - 1051.08s |  could have been used. So John Rapson looked for crypts, for words he could guess in the ciphertext.
1052.04s - 1062.76s |  So here he found one. Here you can see the word IQHL and followed by the word born. So what is
1062.76s - 1070.44s |  born? Of course a child is born, a son is born, a daughter is born. This required some guessing but
1070.44s - 1077.80s |  one of the hypotheses he tested was, well, let's assume that this stands for son and if this is the
1077.80s - 1090.52s |  case IQHL would be replaced by 8196 and maybe this is the correct replacement and if it was the
1090.52s - 1097.16s |  correct replacement this would be how a part of the substitution table looked like. Here's
1097.16s - 1105.16s |  another crypt he found. Here we have the number three followed by the word MIOQ. So what could
1105.64s - 1112.12s |  stand after three? Well, just about anything. Three days, three weeks, three months, three years.
1112.12s - 1120.92s |  Again he guessed and tested several hypotheses and one of these was, well, maybe month was the
1120.92s - 1126.92s |  correct word used here. And again he created a part of a substitution table based on this
1126.92s - 1136.92s |  assumption and, well, the two guesses he had made matched. So this looked quite good. So maybe
1136.92s - 1145.56s |  in addition, the replacement table you see here looks quite plausible. It starts with a zero,
1145.56s - 1155.56s |  then 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. This looks like a good guess. So again he tried to decrypt a
1155.56s - 1165.56s |  message. He took this message, he replaced the letters in every four letter word with the
1165.56s - 1173.56s |  digit according to this table. Then he applied the code from the code book and he got meaningful
1173.56s - 1183.56s |  text. So apparently this was the correct way to decrypt. Yes. So let's give John Rapson an
1183.64s - 1192.20s |  applause because this was a really great piece of cryptanalysis back in 1992. Here we see an
1192.20s - 1199.08s |  example. As mentioned, there were not only these four letter groups but also a couple of
1199.08s - 1204.76s |  uppercase letters and it now became clear what these uppercase letters mean because the code
1204.76s - 1212.68s |  book consists of five parts and one of the parts is divided into subdivisions and apparently each
1213.64s - 1222.92s |  capital letter in the message stands for one of the altogether six parts. And this is exactly
1222.92s - 1231.24s |  how the encryption and the decryption worked. So here we have the E standing for part 4 and
1231.24s - 1237.72s |  this would be part 4 in the code book. Let's now look at the decryption of one of the
1237.72s - 1246.44s |  messages. All are well at Bowdoin and so on. And as it seems, as we see now, this latitude and
1246.44s - 1253.88s |  longitude appears to make sense. We are still not really sure what exactly this means being
1253.88s - 1263.88s |  accurately seen drifts and so on but at least it's plausible. Here's another plain text. You
1264.44s - 1270.28s |  see the original in the upper left corner and this translates to or this decrypts to all are
1270.28s - 1276.28s |  well at home and elsewhere. Margaret had another boy in the evening on Christmas Day and so on.
1276.28s - 1286.28s |  Well, this is family gossip. It's a little disappointing because of course other encrypted
1286.84s - 1294.52s |  messages contain the location of a hidden treasure or politics or important businesses. In this case
1294.52s - 1299.72s |  it's about family news but that's also very interesting because family news from the 19th
1299.72s - 1309.32s |  century, that's not something you encounter every day. So we tried to decrypt this message. It
1309.80s - 1317.64s |  wasn't, it was difficult because some of the words are not, are ambiguous. For example,
1317.64s - 1325.56s |  popularity could also mean population. That's not, both words are possible in the code book. P and
1325.56s - 1333.24s |  M, that might stand for Papa and Mama but that's of course also a guess. And this is also a guess
1333.24s - 1340.36s |  because the words used here are coal and rich so maybe this refers to a person named Coleridge.
1341.24s - 1348.12s |  We don't know but it makes sense in our view. So decryption is difficult, many ambiguities.
1348.92s - 1355.24s |  Here's another plain text. This is especially interesting because it mentions two names that
1355.24s - 1362.68s |  can be identified, Captain Penny and Captain Austin. And as it turned out, both captains were
1362.68s - 1372.28s |  shipmasters who engaged in Franklin rescue expeditions. So we are now back at the Franklin
1373.40s - 1379.56s |  and at Franklin and his rescue expeditions, there appears to be a connection.
1379.88s - 1386.44s |  Here's a list of some of the most important Franklin rescue expeditions which mainly took
1386.44s - 1396.12s |  place or which took place after 1850 when Franklin's wife was calling for help. And if we look
1396.12s - 1403.88s |  at the ads, all of them were published between 1850 and 1855 and this matches exactly with the
1403.88s - 1413.08s |  rescue expedition of Richard Collinson. So was it really Richard Collinson who wrote or received
1413.08s - 1421.16s |  all these encrypted messages? Well, we'll see. Richard Collinson, here you see a picture of him
1421.16s - 1429.56s |  and let's now look at the rescue expedition of Richard Collinson. So Richard Collinson set out
1430.36s - 1440.04s |  on a rescue expedition with two ships, one of them being the Enterprise, on a five-year mission
1441.88s - 1448.84s |  to go and try to find Franklin's expedition. All right, they did not have any success.
1449.40s - 1457.24s |  What they were trying to do is to come around from England, go around and come in
1457.24s - 1464.20s |  from the western side to see if they could find him from that direction. No luck.
1466.12s - 1474.12s |  There's many books written about his expedition, in part because his brother
1475.24s - 1483.80s |  went through his logbooks and wrote another book about Collinson's expedition. And this is one page
1483.80s - 1493.59s |  from that where they talk about cipher notices in the times that use the signal book of the
1493.59s - 1504.82s |  Royal Navy and that this advertisement was regularly published. So now we know the mystery
1504.82s - 1514.10s |  or the purpose of the messages was sought. So we call this the first known secure global
1514.10s - 1520.58s |  communication system. His family published encrypted ads in the times. The times was
1520.58s - 1527.70s |  available in every major port in the world and he could receive messages from his family during his
1527.70s - 1537.78s |  journey. So did the system work? Well, to our knowledge, only in 1855, on his way home, Collinson
1537.78s - 1546.82s |  got access to the times in this port in Indonesia called Banguwangi or Banguwangi. And one thing I've
1546.82s - 1553.46s |  learned from my research is there are many ways to spell Banguwangi. I have found probably 10
1553.46s - 1560.42s |  different ways. And in that page from Collinson's journal, there was a mention of Banguwangi.
1561.14s - 1569.54s |  And I was just at the Royal Museum at Greenwich a couple weeks ago going through the logbooks
1569.54s - 1580.98s |  of Collinson and found this entry from December 12th, 1854, saying that at 2 p.m. he anchored
1580.98s - 1588.58s |  four miles off of Banguwangi at the time. So again, we had that link. Here's the only really
1588.58s - 1595.06s |  good picture we've been able to find of Banguwangi. This is when there was an undersea cable that was
1595.06s - 1604.18s |  being built and this is from 1871. So when he was in Banguwangi, Collinson was able to get four
1604.18s - 1616.62s |  copies of the times and was able to get some news from home that way. Okay, let's now look at the
1616.62s - 1625.02s |  situation half a year ago at the beginning of 2024. As I mentioned, the encryption system that
1625.02s - 1632.14s |  was used for these advertisements was broken. But while breaking a system and decrypting all the
1632.14s - 1638.54s |  messages is of course two different things. In this case, there were 55 messages and not very
1638.54s - 1646.14s |  many of them had been really decrypted. And up to that point, no scholar or no expert of the Franklin
1646.94s - 1657.58s |  Expedition had read the messages. So what we did, Ilonka and I, we started a decryption project. We
1657.58s - 1666.14s |  introduced our concept at the American Cryptogram Association, ACA, and we were joined by Taylor
1666.14s - 1674.22s |  Leach, who is a member of this organization and who took part or who is now taking part in the
1674.22s - 1680.86s |  project. And there were other members from the ACA supporting us. We had a virtual meeting at an
1680.86s - 1690.06s |  ACA convention in 2023 and a couple of Zoom calls and our goal was to decrypt all the Collinson
1690.06s - 1699.26s |  advertisements and this project is still ongoing. Here's a list of all the messages. There are over
1699.26s - 1706.78s |  50. There was one published every month and as you see here, there are gaps. So there were months
1706.78s - 1713.82s |  where no message was published and we don't know why. Maybe there were messages but we haven't
1713.82s - 1721.82s |  found them. Maybe they were published on the wrong day or maybe the newspaper didn't publish them for
1721.82s - 1731.26s |  some reason or there was nothing placed in the newspaper. We simply don't know. Taylor, he wrote a
1731.26s - 1739.90s |  decryption tool based on JavaScript and this decryption tool is available online so if you want to
1739.90s - 1749.10s |  try your luck yourself, here's the URL. So Taylor's decryption tool, it contains a code table taken
1749.10s - 1756.94s |  from the code book and it includes a section to ignore clear text which appears in messages or in
1756.94s - 1766.94s |  many messages such as in or at, so frequent words. And we found out, as already mentioned, this
1766.94s - 1773.02s |  decryption work isn't trivial because there are ambiguities so it's not possible to do everything
1773.10s - 1782.06s |  with a tool. It always requires some manual cleanup afterwards. Here we have a list of all the
1782.06s - 1789.10s |  ciphertext on the left side, all the decryptions of the decryption tool on the right side and in the
1789.10s - 1796.06s |  middle the cleaned up versions. So it's of course a lot of work to do all this description work but
1796.14s - 1804.14s |  it's very fascinating because as I said this is all about family activities in the 1850s. It's
1804.14s - 1815.58s |  a first hand information from what happened in a certain family and well it's a fascinating look
1815.58s - 1822.94s |  into history. One important question is well who actually published the ads or who wrote these
1822.94s - 1831.66s |  messages? It obviously was somebody from the family or maybe a close friend. Some of the ads
1831.66s - 1839.66s |  are signed J.D.W. This is clearly Julia de Winton, the sister of Collinson and some of the
1839.66s - 1847.66s |  messages are signed A.C. We are not sure what this means, which person signed A.C. It might be
1848.22s - 1856.22s |  another sister of Collinson but we are not sure. Well Julia de Winton who created many of these
1856.22s - 1863.74s |  messages was also a novelist in the Victorian era so very interesting. Well honestly I haven't
1863.74s - 1869.90s |  ever read any of these books but it's of course interesting to see that a novelist also wrote
1869.90s - 1878.30s |  encrypted messages to her brother being on an expedition in northern Canada or wherever in the world.
1882.76s - 1890.60s |  So while we were doing research at the Maritime Library we did find several letters. It's a
1890.60s - 1896.52s |  little difficult because they're not entirely in context so there'll be a folder that says
1897.32s - 1903.08s |  Collinson letters and just a big stack of letters and so we're kind of going through them and
1903.08s - 1910.44s |  we found that some of these were letters from Collinson's other relatives like
1910.44s - 1919.16s |  Sophia and Amelia. The addresses were often very creative. For example, so we have somewhere near
1919.16s - 1929.96s |  the North Pole and here was another one that said Hong Kong or Arctic Expedition Pacific and so
1929.96s - 1934.44s |  they would kind of send it out and hope that it would be passed from ship to ship and hopefully
1934.44s - 1940.44s |  end up with their brother ship. So we know now that there were at least two ways of communication.
1940.44s - 1947.80s |  We had the newspaper advertisements from Julia and A.C. and letters from Amelia and Sophia.
1950.98s - 1957.38s |  And now let's look at the content or at the plaintext of the ads. Many of the ads
1957.94s - 1964.74s |  mention places mainly in Great Britain which is not very surprising. Apparently Collinson's family
1964.74s - 1971.86s |  or many of the family members lived in the Newcastle area so Newcastle and the surrounding
1971.94s - 1980.26s |  is mentioned many times in the messages but they're also relatives apparently in London
1980.26s - 1987.38s |  and Portsmouth, Southampton and elsewhere. And no surprise is that places in northern
1987.38s - 1994.74s |  Canada were mentioned a couple of times because this was actually the destination of Franklin's
1994.74s - 2000.34s |  expedition and of course also of Collinson's expedition. And it's also interesting to look at
2000.34s - 2009.38s |  a few events that are mentioned in these ads. Here we have an ad from 1850. It mentions
2010.02s - 2018.66s |  windows, a window is in church. We found out that the family of Collinson or of his sister donated
2018.66s - 2027.78s |  a couple of windows in churches in Wales and this is here you can see pictures of these and this is
2027.78s - 2037.22s |  a drawing we found in the archive. So apparently here on the left side we see the small gentle
2037.22s - 2045.46s |  window as it was and on the right side as it is now so after the renovation. And here we have
2045.46s - 2054.26s |  another mentioning of windows, three new windows. Well we found a drawing of these three new windows
2054.26s - 2061.54s |  in the archive. In this case the old version is on the right and the new version of the
2061.54s - 2070.58s |  windows is on the left. So this is clearly what this message refers to. Here we read
2071.22s - 2078.82s |  Queen opening Newcastle station late in August. Well in fact on August 29th 1850
2079.38s - 2084.18s |  Queen Victoria opened the train station of Newcastle.
2086.58s - 2095.06s |  And here we read Bernard has been made engineer of the Great Exhibition. This refers to the Great
2095.06s - 2105.54s |  Exhibition at Crystal Palace which is also known as the World's Fair in 1851. Okay so this is what
2105.54s - 2113.22s |  we found in the messages and well let's now draw a conclusion. All right so we know that
2113.22s - 2120.66s |  Collinson's family sent messages during his journey and it was via encrypted ads, one per month. They
2120.66s - 2128.50s |  also sent letters. We have a project where we are trying to decipher all 50 of these ads and put
2128.50s - 2134.10s |  them in the right context. Hopefully we'll be done by the end of the year and then we'll be
2134.10s - 2140.10s |  publishing a paper in Cryptologia. If anyone wants to help we're always up for more help.
2140.90s - 2155.29s |  And other than that thank you. We have about seven minutes for questions.
2166.50s - 2173.46s |  Yes the question was why were these messages encrypted? Well probably to keep these family
2173.46s - 2180.74s |  stories private. That's probably the main reason. So I think these messages contain nothing
2180.74s - 2187.30s |  absolutely secret but apparently the family members didn't want to read their family gossip
2187.30s - 2194.18s |  in the times where everybody could see it. Another reason is that when you're encrypting something you
2194.18s - 2200.82s |  can often put more information into it than when it's clear text. For example with telegrams where
2200.82s - 2206.90s |  people would have to pay by the word and so there were rapidly code books coming up where you could
2206.90s - 2216.15s |  put a small amount of text to mean a lot a much larger phrase. How hard is it to source the code
2216.15s - 2222.47s |  books? How hard is it to source the code books? I imagine they don't pop up on ebay very often.
2222.47s - 2228.07s |  Yeah as a matter of fact if you look in a hacker tracker we have some links to the code books. Oh
2228.07s - 2234.23s |  nice. Yeah well I mean like with different code books that you may not have. Oh to find other
2234.23s - 2241.67s |  code books? Yeah. It is a constant quest. Uh and anytime someone finds a new code book then
2241.67s - 2249.11s |  there's a race to see does this code book help us crack any of the unsolved messages from many
2249.11s - 2255.67s |  sources. Uh or sometimes we'll try to derive a code book from what we can read. Like if you heard
2255.67s - 2268.06s |  about uh the Mary Queen of Scots uh story they derived things from that. I love it. So was the
2268.06s - 2273.34s |  use of this type of system I mean outside of you know military people maybe you know ship captain
2273.34s - 2279.82s |  or military folks like you know lovers. Was this really I mean did you come across information
2279.82s - 2285.74s |  about people talking about this socially? You know um that that's essentially my question.
2285.82s - 2293.74s |  Well um most of the of the ads were clearly published by lovers. There might be more
2293.74s - 2299.18s |  business related messages but probably these are the ones that are not broken yet because
2299.18s - 2305.10s |  they use the stronger encryption. So apart from this well this story is something special because
2305.10s - 2312.06s |  it's not about lovers communicating with each other. Um did you find anything else that's not
2312.06s - 2318.46s |  really? Well we know of at least one private detective who would send messages to his clients
2319.02s - 2324.70s |  by putting encrypted ads in the newspaper in London. Uh and he may have actually been the
2324.70s - 2329.90s |  origin of the Sherlock Holmes story. Was there like discussion of this you know socially in the
2329.90s - 2335.18s |  media you know contemporaneously in this you know 1850s to 1890s you know is there any kind of
2335.18s - 2343.90s |  mention of yes yes and especially this was a very high status family and we have found many
2343.90s - 2350.46s |  mentions that it was the buzz uh when people would get together and like oh there's these
2350.46s - 2358.22s |  classified ads in the times and who's making them and why are they making them and I I think uh it
2358.22s - 2365.02s |  did come out that Jada W was Julia DeWinton because that was published somewhere but the
2365.02s - 2373.02s |  actual system was never published and there's a a short story from about that time period where
2373.02s - 2379.90s |  someone is writing about these ads and they made up their own system because they knew no one else
2379.90s - 2384.70s |  could solve it so why don't they just make up their own system uh and then they wrote a story
2384.70s - 2393.90s |  about it. I'm a long time fan from the AP days so. Thank you. Do you know how often the times was
2393.90s - 2399.26s |  published? Was it published daily or or was it published monthly in the 1850s? It was published
2399.26s - 2405.90s |  daily but I don't know if there were two uh if there was an edition on Sunday that there might
2405.90s - 2411.02s |  have been a Saturday edition that also covered the Sunday but apart from that it was published
2411.02s - 2414.78s |  every day. Yeah. Do you have an idea of how expensive it would have been to publish and
2414.78s - 2420.22s |  advertise? Um we. I'm sorry you couldn't hear the question. Uh the question was how expensive it was
2421.10s - 2427.98s |  I I think we have no information how much it costs in England but in uh France uh we have
2427.98s - 2435.18s |  this information of course it's always difficult to say uh how much um 10 francs were in in 1850
2435.18s - 2442.70s |  but I think compared to the gold price the the price for um an encrypted or for an advertisement
2442.70s - 2457.64s |  was roughly 20 dollars or so in today's world. It wasn't cheap. Thank you. Hello uh how much has LLMs
2457.64s - 2462.92s |  and OpenAI affected your work in the past three years that you just dump them in there and see
2462.92s - 2470.44s |  what comes out? Oh sorry a little closer uh how has LLMs and like OpenAI technology affected your
2470.44s - 2481.00s |  work? You mean uh artificial if uh yes artificial artificial intelligence. LGBT yeah. Yes or in
2481.00s - 2488.20s |  general um so far artificial intelligence hasn't been used very much in breaking old ciphers but
2488.20s - 2494.68s |  it's changing. I I can imagine that it's very helpful especially if you have an encrypted text
2494.68s - 2499.80s |  and you you don't know what it is about. So there are certain algorithms where you can tell well
2499.80s - 2505.24s |  this might be an encryption of this kind or that kind and it requires some experience and I'm
2505.24s - 2512.36s |  pretty sure that artificial intelligence can help a lot uh doing this and I know of research projects
2513.16s - 2520.76s |  that examine this kind of analysis but so far it it hasn't been applied very often. Do you know
2521.16s - 2531.24s |  anything else? I've done quite a bit with LLMs involving another code cryptos and no they they
2531.24s - 2538.20s |  can translate from one language to another but they can't count. Like if you ask for a sentence
2538.20s - 2561.08s |  it's 97 letters long total fail total fail yeah. Did Collinson survive? Yes uh yeah well uh we know
2561.08s - 2567.08s |  of four he really received well first of all Collinson survived but I think it was his last
2567.08s - 2573.24s |  expedition so as far as I know the government was not very content with the way he led this
2573.24s - 2580.04s |  exhibition expedition so it was his last one and I think he retired afterwards and as far as we know
2580.04s - 2585.56s |  four of the messages or he received four of the messages in Banyuwangi that was probably
2585.56s - 2591.88s |  all so apparently the system worked but not very well. I'm sure he saw the other messages once he
2591.88s - 2599.08s |  got home uh yeah that that his sister had them but but as Klaus said um there was a lot of uh
2599.08s - 2605.72s |  unrest on the ship and Collinson was very much blamed for that and uh has nothing to do with
2605.72s - 2611.80s |  codes but yeah. You mentioned a couple of the other um family member names do you have a reason
2611.80s - 2617.72s |  to believe or do you have a reason why you think uh Amelia is not AC um and given the fact that you
2617.72s - 2621.48s |  have other letters and other documents from the family do you think you're going to be able to
2621.48s - 2629.00s |  look at? Yes uh Amelia Collinson or AC might be Amelia Collinson that's correct uh would be a good
2629.00s - 2635.48s |  hypothesis. They tended to use their married name at that point uh it could well be but we've we've
2635.48s - 2640.76s |  just never found any confirmation that it was Amelia with Julia we have written confirmation
2640.76s - 2654.52s |  that yes it was Julia but it might be okay all right thank you. Thank you.
