0.24s - 5.88s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Alright. So, uh, my name is Michael, and this is the title of my talk. It is Laundering
5.88s - 10.08s |  Money. If you're here to learn about laundering money, you're in the wrong place. Because
10.08s - 15.08s |  this talk is laundering money. Um, what we're going to do today is do some laundry for free
18.02s - 23.02s |  on machines that would really rather that you pay for them. Uh, in other words, what we're
23.02s - 28.02s |  going to do is save, that's right, laundering money. And from whom are we going to save?
31.16s - 37.60s |  A company called CSC ServiceWorks, who is the villain of this talk. Uh, and that is despite
37.60s - 42.62s |  the fact that, uh, to the untrained eye it's going to look like I am the one doing all of the
44.32s - 49.32s |  bad things. Uh, but I promise you, uh, I know we are the protagonists. Um, this is our
51.52s - 56.52s |  target. It is, uh, these are the washers in my building. Uh, they are CSC branded. Um, and
57.48s - 63.94s |  these are the dryers on the other side of the hallway. Uh, they are speed queens. Speed
63.94s - 69.42s |  queens are the most popular model of commercial washer and dryer in the United States. Uh, and
69.42s - 74.56s |  I made that up, but it's probably true. Uh, the manuals for these can all be found online.
74.56s - 79.10s |  They're extensively documented. And the manuals tell you how to hack the machine. But the
79.10s - 85.14s |  problem is that CSC, because they suck, have modified the base speed queens so that nothing
85.16s - 91.52s |  works. Right? So, here's a comprehensive list of things that do not work. And I have to do
91.52s - 96.26s |  this because if I don't, inevitably someone is going to come up to me at the end of the talk
96.26s - 101.44s |  and tell me that I'm an idiot and that I've wasted my time and that he saw a TikTok video and
101.44s - 105.88s |  all you have to do is press two buttons and the machine will do whatever you want. It's not
105.88s - 110.58s |  true. Uh, so we're going to start with the stupidest tricks. Who played video games in the
110.58s - 116.10s |  80s or 90s? Uh, you used to be able to go to an arcade, uh, and then go to the hardware store,
116.10s - 119.90s |  buy a washer that was just quarter sized and put it in the machine and it would give you
119.90s - 125.30s |  credit for a quarter. Uh, these days the washers cost more than the quarters do, but it's the
125.30s - 129.70s |  principle. There's a type of person who is willing to spend 40 cents to make sure that the
129.70s - 135.84s |  other guy gets zero cents and it's nice to meet you too. Uh, the second bullet point here is
135.84s - 140.78s |  if the first one fails, uh, if it knows that the washer is not a quarter, you can drill a tiny
140.78s - 145.38s |  hole in a real quarter, tie a string around it and go fishing like Wile E. Coyote and just pull
145.38s - 149.28s |  the quarter back out. Doesn't work. These machines have trap doors in the coin slot
149.28s - 155.46s |  mechanism. So, manual mode. The two button trick from TikTok puts the machine into
155.46s - 160.34s |  something called manual mode which believe it or not is documented in the manual. Uh, there
160.34s - 165.10s |  are several ways to get into manual mode which gives you admin privileges and none of them
165.10s - 171.06s |  work because CSC has changed the base model, uh, and all the circuitry. Uh, there's also a
171.06s - 176.88s |  dip switch to turn off the entire payment system. Doesn't work. And, uh, I'm from Baltimore
176.88s - 182.14s |  and there's a guy up the street, uh, in Philadelphia who has a video on YouTube, uh, where he
182.14s - 186.48s |  just takes a pocket knife basically and shorts out these two wires. This doesn't work on my
186.48s - 193.06s |  model because my model doesn't have those wires. Alright, but who is CSC ServiceWorks?
193.08s - 197.46s |  Well, what do they do? They take these laundry machines, they outfit them with a pay module
197.46s - 202.42s |  and they put them into condo buildings and apartments and the residents pay to use them and
202.42s - 207.44s |  in exchange CSC is supposed to maintain the machines. There are three ways to pay. Uh, the
207.44s - 212.00s |  first is a refillable chip card, the second are these two stupid apps, and the third is with
212.00s - 217.48s |  quarters, the old fashioned way, right? But, a picture is worth a thousand words. And so
217.50s - 222.64s |  here's a picture of what CSC actually does. Uh, I hope you can see that it's quite
222.64s - 227.84s |  impressive because it's not possible to give a lower rating than one star and there are
227.84s - 234.66s |  343 reviews up there. Uh, but right, the better business bureau sucks, so what if you trust
234.66s - 240.22s |  Yelp? Ooh, we're, we're getting better at least. Uh, but Yelp has been known to manipulate
240.22s - 246.56s |  ratings, so what if we ask Google? Yikes. Okay, uh, well this is unfair because what is a
246.58s - 253.36s |  one star rating even mean? We need to be able to put this into context somehow, uh, to really,
253.36s - 258.56s |  you know, be able to judge what one star means. I'm from Baltimore, uh, so to put this in
258.56s - 264.30s |  context for me, I decided to find out what former residents think of the Baltimore jail after
264.30s - 270.54s |  they've been released. You heard it here first, folks. Uh, having any sort of business
270.54s - 276.14s |  relationship with CSC service works is less fun than jail. And not just any jail, Baltimore
276.20s - 283.20s |  jail. Alright. Now, yes, a picture is worth a thousand words, but words are also worth words.
283.20s - 287.70s |  Uh, specifically each word is worth one word. So I'm going to use some words to tell you
287.70s - 292.74s |  about the dark patterns that CSC uses to steal money from its customers. And for two
292.74s - 296.74s |  reasons. Because, right, in a minute I'm going to rob these guys and I don't want anyone to
296.74s - 301.78s |  feel guilty. Uh, that's the first reason. Uh, but the second reason is that this is a
301.82s - 306.60s |  security-minded audience and some of these are actually kind of good and would be funny if it
306.60s - 311.76s |  wasn't my money they're stealing. The first dark pattern is with the, um, refillable chip
311.76s - 316.64s |  cards, which have the same downsides that any, like, gift card have, right? Uh, if the
316.64s - 321.04s |  company stops supporting them or if they change the machines, if you lose it, if it's, you
321.04s - 326.04s |  know, you're fucked. Uh, these specific card machines, they have, uh, a separate refill
326.42s - 333.28s |  machine and some fine print in the lower right hand corner of the refill machine that says
333.28s - 337.96s |  that they do not accept one dollar bills. Oh, they accept one dollar bills. What they won't
337.96s - 343.00s |  do is put one dollar on your card and you have to call customer service and spend an hour on
343.00s - 347.76s |  the phone to get your one dollar back. Uh, the third bullet point is one of my favorites. So
347.76s - 352.60s |  CSC has to coordinate with the people who own the buildings to do any sort of maintenance
352.60s - 356.98s |  on the machines and they're upgrading from the card machines now to the app machines. So
356.98s - 360.84s |  they coordinated with my building and with several other people's buildings and you know
360.84s - 365.68s |  they picked a date, put up flyers, sent out emails, uh, let everyone know when the machines
365.68s - 369.92s |  are going to be changed over and then two weeks ahead of schedule at like 630 in the morning
369.92s - 374.92s |  they sent in a, a covert laundry ops team to steal the old card reader machines and replace
374.92s - 379.00s |  them with app machines. Now why is this a dark pattern? Because it strands like a hundred
379.00s - 383.14s |  people with a stupid card with money on it that they can't spend that they've already paid
383.14s - 388.44s |  for. Uh, and the only way to get it back now is to just snail mail the card to them and pray
388.44s - 391.94s |  because you don't even know how much money is on the card because they stole the fucking card
391.94s - 398.12s |  reader. Uh, the machine settings also don't work in your favor. When I originally did this
398.12s - 402.46s |  work the machines in my building were a dollar eighty five a piece and you could only put ten
402.46s - 406.96s |  dollars at a time on your card and if you ever tried to spend ten dollars one eighty five at a
406.96s - 412.00s |  time you can't. So when you lose that card they get some of your money. Now they've since
412.00s - 416.64s |  remedied this by raising the price to two dollars but also fucked them for raising the price.
416.64s - 422.74s |  Um, if you put quarters into the uh coin operated machines you lose the ability to change any
422.74s - 428.04s |  of the cycle options so if you try to change from say uh cold water to hot water and you
428.04s - 432.22s |  forget after you've put a quarter in you can't. You have to take your laundry, move it next
432.22s - 436.92s |  door, pay again and then run with the hot water. Alright. I don't know too much about the
436.92s - 441.88s |  apps because I would rather die than install an app on my phone. Uh, but I do know that the
441.88s - 446.70s |  apps will take your money at any time over cellular data but you can only redeem the credit if
446.70s - 452.26s |  the building's wifi is up and if CSC servers are working. Finally, the oldest dark pattern in
452.26s - 456.46s |  the world is to just have shitty customer service. Once they have your money they don't want
456.46s - 461.10s |  to answer the phone and they especially don't want to give it back. Uh, they also do not fix
461.10s - 464.78s |  the machines which you may recall if you were paying attention is the one thing that they're
464.80s - 468.84s |  supposed to do in exchange for your money. And the last one doesn't fit anywhere but I threw
468.84s - 475.52s |  it in there. They lost a re- a Rico lawsuit for doing Rico shit. So, I've concluded the CSC's
475.52s - 479.28s |  business model is just stealing quarters from old ladies because what are you going to do
479.28s - 485.30s |  about it? Well, what am I going to do about it? This is me. Um, why do I care so much? So,
485.30s - 490.26s |  I've been in the industry for like 20 years doing programming, system administration,
490.26s - 494.20s |  hacking. I was one of the teenagers who got in trouble for taking down MySpace. These
494.22s - 499.92s |  days I do more benign stuff. I, uh, file CVEs against open source projects and contribute
499.92s - 505.96s |  fixes. Uh, I'm a Gen 2 Linux developer. I have a PhD in math. Doesn't matter. Nobody cares.
505.96s - 511.00s |  All you need to know about me is that I really hate being taken advantage of. Especially when
511.00s - 516.20s |  it's for a small amount of money. And especially when the implication is that I just won't do
516.20s - 520.44s |  anything about it. Now, this is DEF CON. So, there are a lot of people here who are way
520.44s - 525.46s |  better than me with electronic thing it, uh, what's it's and thingamabobs. However, I do
528.32s - 534.32s |  have a very particular set of skills. So, I'm going to use those skills to give myself a
534.32s - 541.29s |  refund. Why? So, first we gotta get into these things, right? These are the dryers. That's the
545.95s - 551.13s |  front view. That's the top view. Those are Phillips screws. And this is a Phillips
551.13s - 556.15s |  screwdriver. This is a 20 minute talk. I'm not sure what you expected. The washers are a
558.61s - 562.59s |  little bit harder, right? There's a tubular lock on the front of that thing and so we've got
562.59s - 568.09s |  some options. The first option, hardcore mode. If you know how to pick tubular locks, that'll
568.09s - 572.69s |  get you right in. But there's a problem with this. Now, there's an entire village of people
572.69s - 576.63s |  here who would love to discuss the intricacies of lock pick along with you and then they
576.63s - 580.73s |  would tell you not to pick any lock that doesn't belong to you. I'm not one of those
580.73s - 586.75s |  people. Follow your heart. Do what the fuck you want to. Now, we can sidestep that issue
590.35s - 594.65s |  though. Right? Inside the door of the washers there's a sticker that says Alliance Laundry
594.65s - 600.05s |  Systems. Now I guess they supplied these machines to CSC before the retrofit. Uh and I might
600.05s - 604.53s |  have got the idea to just type in Alliance Laundry Systems into Google. I'm not sure if you
604.53s - 609.83s |  can read the fine print. Uh but that says Alliance Washer Dryer Key that I've typed into the
609.83s - 616.47s |  search box and you only get one result and it's a key that costs $5.80 which I am more than
616.47s - 621.49s |  willing to risk to to look cool up here on stage. And what do you know? Not only does it
625.49s - 631.75s |  open this one, it opens them all. Now, once we're inside of course we have to actually give
631.75s - 638.69s |  ourselves a refund somehow uh via subterfuge. And so there are some caveats here. Right?
638.69s - 643.69s |  Chronologically this is where all the things that don't work would go in my story. Um and
643.69s - 647.57s |  once you have physical access to a machine, hacking it really shouldn't be that hard. But
647.57s - 651.31s |  there are some extra constraints here that make it difficult. First is that I can't break the
651.31s - 655.41s |  machine. Right? My neighbors use these machines to do laundry. I like my neighbors and you
655.41s - 659.01s |  really don't want to be on the bad side of someone who wakes up at 5 in the morning on a
659.01s - 664.15s |  Sunday to do laundry. Really though, I can't break the machine because if I break the
664.15s - 667.19s |  machine the property manager is going to get involved. They're going to call the board. The
667.19s - 671.39s |  board is made up of my neighbors. I like my neighbors. I don't want to waste their time. But
671.39s - 676.83s |  seriously, I can't break the machines. If I break the machines the $2 joke doesn't go so
676.83s - 684.66s |  well. What are they going to do? Sue me for $1,000? Sticker to the rescue. Inside the
684.66s - 688.64s |  dryers we see uh they have another Alliance laundry system sticker. So all these things come
688.64s - 692.70s |  from the same place. And you can't find too much information about the circuitry from
692.70s - 697.20s |  Alliance's website. They don't have pictures of like the coin drop mechanism or anything. But
697.20s - 703.64s |  Google does. Oh, sorry. There's only three wires coming out of this thing. How hard could it
703.64s - 708.58s |  be? And we see inside the washers that we've got the same three wires going into a bullet
708.58s - 714.58s |  connector. This is a paper clip with some tape around it. Just shove it in there. Ding ding
714.58s - 719.58s |  ding. Each time you short it out you get credit for putting one quarter in. In seconds. It
720.18s - 726.43s |  doesn't take weeks in snail mail to get a refund. Ha. The dryers are a little bit more
729.13s - 734.37s |  difficult because uh you see there's no bullet connector here. But again uh when faced with
734.37s - 739.21s |  adversity I find that it's always best to follow your heart and just do what the fuck you want
739.21s - 744.21s |  to. And strip a little shielding off those fuckers. And just touch them together. It works.
744.73s - 749.73s |  It's fine. Ding ding ding. And you get a refund from the dryers too. Now the next slide says the
754.61s - 759.55s |  end but it's not really the end. Because of course there's a live demo that's pre-recorded
759.55s - 769.53s |  uh but it's live. I just, it was live when I pre-recorded it. But it's live. What's up Defcon?
769.53s - 778.02s |  We're doing full screen. This is important. And this is laundering money. I'm here in my
778.18s - 782.18s |  building's laundry room at three in the morning on a Monday because I'm about to do absolutely
782.18s - 787.18s |  nothing wrong. Before we get started I've got to attach my phone to my Yopro so that you can
790.52s - 799.07s |  see what I can see. So bear with me for a second. That should just about do it. And since I've
801.55s - 807.55s |  already told you how this is gonna go uh we can just jump right into the demo. So over here on my
807.57s - 813.93s |  right we see a bunch of stupid washing machines and the first thing that we need to do to get some
813.93s - 820.55s |  free money out of these guys is to get into this service panel. Now obviously the best way to do
820.55s - 825.55s |  that in terms of how cool it makes you look is with this Covert Instruments tubular lockpick.
827.95s - 833.35s |  This is much more than a lockpick. It is actually an impressioning tool which means that you can
833.35s - 838.39s |  save your game once you've picked the lock. And that is why I do not have to stand here for 30
838.39s - 845.03s |  seconds and jiggle this thing back and forth uh to get the lock open. Uh however you'll notice I've
845.03s - 849.77s |  closed the panel back up and the reason for that is because as it turns out in the state of
849.77s - 854.77s |  Maryland at least it is illegal to use a lockpick to commit a crime. And so instead I have here
856.57s - 861.59s |  with me my great hundred key that I have purchased from Alliance Laundry Systems and what I'm
861.59s - 866.59s |  going to do is open the service panel with this guy. Once it's open we can immediately identify
871.91s - 876.91s |  the trio of red black and white wires running in from the coin drop mechanism and to perform the
878.77s - 884.25s |  cha-ching operation I'm going to be using this custom hacking tool here that you can find at any
884.25s - 889.25s |  Radio Shack. And all I'm going to do is insert the ends of it into the holes occupied by the
889.25s - 899.53s |  red and black wires. Eventually the machine will go apeshit to indicate success and you can close
904.41s - 913.22s |  up the service panel once more. And that's it for the washers. Now we move on to the dryers. The
917.46s - 922.46s |  dryers are protected by phillips screws and you will need a phillips screwdriver to remove them.
922.46s - 927.46s |  If you do not have a phillips screwdriver I think you can find these on ebay but once we've got
933.67s - 938.67s |  them removed the service panel comes right off and we once again identify the trio of red black and
943.01s - 948.01s |  white wires. On this machine it looks like someone was kind enough to pre-strip the red and black
949.01s - 954.01s |  wires and cover them with electrical tape. So all we have to do is remove this electrical tape and
960.45s - 965.45s |  then to perform the cha-ching operation on the dryer I'm just going to smoosh the exposed portion
967.09s - 972.09s |  together with my hands. And you'll notice I'm doing this with my bare hands and the reason for that is
973.05s - 978.05s |  because it's actually safe to touch any exposed wires with your bare hands. Uh it's called grounding
980.53s - 1008.57s |  look it up. Once again the loud screeching noise from the siren indicates that everything is fine. We
1011.61s - 1016.61s |  can replace the electric tape and close the panel back up. Wait there's more. I'm so glad this
1016.73s - 1045.79s |  happened. Defcon it's your boy back in the LR with an update. It is August 5th a few days before the
1058.75s - 1063.55s |  conference and with all the publicity surrounding this talk it looks like CSC has upgraded the
1063.55s - 1067.39s |  security on the machines in my building. Now it's not clear if this is a company wide
1067.39s - 1072.29s |  initiative or just a personal fuck you to Michael Arlitsky and so to be on the safe side uh we're
1072.31s - 1077.31s |  going to bypass it. The first thing that they've done is to replace the old shitty tubular locks on
1078.75s - 1084.15s |  the washers with the new shitty tubular locks. So unfortunately the great hundred key will no
1084.15s - 1089.23s |  longer open that up uh but if you have the covered instruments tubular lock pick of course uh it
1089.23s - 1094.23s |  comes right open. So fuck out of my face with that shit. On the dryers what they've done is to
1095.21s - 1100.21s |  replace the Phillips screws with these security Torx screws. Now the nice thing about these is that
1103.55s - 1109.03s |  if you don't have the bit you can buy a set on Amazon for about $6.99 and the nice thing about
1109.03s - 1114.29s |  $6.99 is that if you don't have it what you can do is completely ignore everything that I just
