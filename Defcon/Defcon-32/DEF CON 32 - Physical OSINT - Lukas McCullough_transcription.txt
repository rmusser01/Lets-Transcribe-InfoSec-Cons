0.11s - 2.67s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Hello, hello.
2.67s - 4.87s |  So I have just about a minute till I start,
4.87s - 6.39s |  but I'll get started now.
6.39s - 8.03s |  Good morning, everyone.
8.03s - 11.59s |  Hope you had a good Saturday night, some parties and stuff.
11.59s - 13.91s |  So just a little bit of background on me.
13.91s - 15.43s |  I'm from Physical Security Village.
15.43s - 16.55s |  My name's Lucas.
16.55s - 19.23s |  I'm a grad student at BU, cybersecurity and criminal
19.23s - 21.67s |  justice major.
21.67s - 24.63s |  So I'm just going to go over a little bit of what is OSINT.
24.63s - 27.11s |  So OSINT is really anything on the internet
27.11s - 30.67s |  that can be classified as usable, right?
30.67s - 33.07s |  As long as you don't have to break into anything or pay
33.07s - 36.47s |  for it, because I'm a broke college student,
36.47s - 39.27s |  that is what I consider open source intelligence.
39.27s - 44.31s |  So not hacking into anything, et cetera, et cetera.
44.31s - 47.39s |  So where you can apply the information,
47.39s - 48.79s |  there's tons of organizations that
48.79s - 51.79s |  use open source intelligence, one of them being Trace Labs.
51.79s - 54.69s |  This is where I got my start in open source intelligence.
54.69s - 58.89s |  What it does is they have a crowdsourced game,
58.89s - 62.77s |  like a CTF game, where you take information
62.77s - 64.49s |  based on missing people.
64.49s - 67.49s |  You try to help find them, but it incentivizes you,
67.49s - 69.53s |  because you get points based on how actionable
69.53s - 71.13s |  that intelligence is.
71.13s - 73.57s |  So it's a really good way to innovate on the fly,
73.57s - 76.41s |  and it makes you feel good afterwards.
76.41s - 79.77s |  Also, shout out to Joe Gray from the OSINTian.
79.77s - 82.93s |  He taught me a lot of what I know.
82.93s - 86.13s |  So commonly used resources in OSINT
86.13s - 88.45s |  are basically social media, right?
88.45s - 90.45s |  So everyone here, I assume, is on LinkedIn
90.45s - 91.49s |  and has been posting.
91.49s - 95.01s |  So if I were to follow you, you were my target,
95.01s - 99.41s |  I could see information based on your career, what
99.41s - 101.19s |  you're striving to achieve.
101.19s - 103.29s |  Everyone posts stuff like that.
103.29s - 105.57s |  And then from there, I'll probably get your full name.
105.57s - 107.81s |  You could go to Instagram, Facebook, stuff like that.
107.81s - 109.93s |  You could find family, friends.
109.93s - 112.77s |  And then once you start getting to know this person's life,
112.77s - 115.33s |  you're really able to insert yourself into their story
115.33s - 118.89s |  and get more information on them than they probably
118.89s - 121.45s |  know is out and available.
121.45s - 125.61s |  So has anyone here posted a photo of their new badge
125.61s - 128.81s |  the first day that they got to work?
128.81s - 132.01s |  OK, well, a lot of people do, and it's a big security risk.
132.01s - 135.29s |  It's a great part of OSINT and shifting to social engineering,
135.29s - 138.97s |  because that just shows, oh, I'm a new person.
138.97s - 140.29s |  I got my badge.
140.29s - 142.47s |  And now I know what new people with their new badges
142.47s - 143.27s |  look like as well.
143.27s - 146.47s |  So that's a security risk in this.
146.47s - 148.47s |  So I'm going to go over some tools that are used
148.47s - 150.75s |  a lot in OSINT investigations.
150.75s - 152.19s |  First one being Multigo.
152.19s - 155.95s |  So Multigo has so many different databases it pulls from.
155.95s - 160.23s |  You can just insert a name, an address, phone number,
160.23s - 163.55s |  any sort of identifier, and it will pull from those databases
163.55s - 167.07s |  any objects listed with that same identifier.
167.07s - 169.39s |  So I personally have not accessed
169.39s - 172.35s |  all the APIs in Multigo, but it's a great place
172.39s - 176.11s |  to find new leads that you didn't even
176.11s - 178.19s |  know were actually available.
178.19s - 181.35s |  It's a great starting tool.
181.35s - 185.35s |  So Whois is going to link a little bit next to the tool
185.35s - 187.15s |  I show afterward.
187.15s - 190.55s |  It just turns domain names into server IPs.
190.55s - 192.39s |  So that's really useful for when you're
192.39s - 194.39s |  trying to do OSINT on a company.
194.39s - 196.81s |  You have their domain name, and then you can get their IPs,
196.81s - 198.71s |  and then you shift to Shodan.
198.71s - 201.43s |  So Shodan shows technologies and stuff
201.43s - 206.07s |  like that for what's hosted on that server IP.
206.07s - 209.63s |  So it'll show, if you can see the open ports in the top
209.63s - 212.55s |  right, it also shows what is returned
212.55s - 214.47s |  by each of those ports.
214.47s - 215.99s |  And then in the bottom, it'll show
215.99s - 218.91s |  what kind of operating system, et cetera,
218.91s - 222.07s |  is running on that machine.
222.07s - 224.71s |  Next one up is, I don't know how to pronounce it.
224.71s - 226.91s |  It's either Wiggle, Weigel.
226.91s - 229.91s |  Wiggle.net is where all people who do war driving
229.91s - 233.23s |  upload their data for the public to browse.
233.23s - 234.79s |  This is super useful, essentially,
234.79s - 238.39s |  for when you're looking at commercial spaces,
238.39s - 241.95s |  you can see what Wi-Fi networks are operating in that area.
241.95s - 244.47s |  And you can kind of narrow down what router, et cetera,
244.47s - 245.91s |  is there.
245.91s - 249.83s |  And the MAC addresses are listed with the router, with the SSID.
249.83s - 252.07s |  You can find out which manufacturer
252.07s - 253.43s |  created that router.
253.43s - 255.07s |  And you can cross-verify that.
255.07s - 257.35s |  If you see a picture of it, let's say in a Google review
257.35s - 259.43s |  or something like that, you see a Cisco router,
259.43s - 262.79s |  you see an address that is generated by a Cisco router
262.79s - 265.23s |  as well, then you know that's the router and the network
265.23s - 267.99s |  that you're going to have to look at.
267.99s - 272.15s |  So a lot of OSINT investigators love frameworks.
272.15s - 274.99s |  So this framework here, it has, you
274.99s - 276.71s |  see these little blue dots?
276.71s - 279.35s |  Each one of those, I know it's really small,
279.35s - 283.39s |  represents a different amount of information
283.39s - 285.71s |  that you want to get, whether it's email addresses,
285.71s - 289.35s |  usernames, anything from what language
289.35s - 290.75s |  you see on the screen.
290.75s - 292.55s |  You click on that blue dot, and then you
292.55s - 296.31s |  have those websites that this person has graciously
296.31s - 299.63s |  created to point you in the direction of that tool
299.63s - 300.99s |  that you need.
300.99s - 303.07s |  A lot of people use their own frameworks
303.07s - 306.75s |  and create their own routines that they go
306.75s - 308.47s |  through for each investigation.
308.47s - 311.05s |  But this is a great way to find your own
311.05s - 315.55s |  by finding those tools that you gravitate towards a lot.
315.55s - 317.67s |  So I'm going to transition to locations a bit.
317.67s - 319.99s |  I think everyone knows Google Dorking.
319.99s - 326.95s |  So you can use Google Dorking for finding floor plans,
326.95s - 329.07s |  rental agreements, stuff like that.
329.07s - 333.03s |  A great thing to know is there's a lot of information
333.03s - 335.27s |  that's listed by address, and especially
335.27s - 337.51s |  if you're looking to high-rises and stuff like that.
337.51s - 339.55s |  High-rises don't typically change shape
339.55s - 341.31s |  from the first floor to the top floor.
341.31s - 345.15s |  So it's mainly cookie cutter every way up.
345.25s - 347.95s |  So this is an example of finding information from an address
347.95s - 350.47s |  rather than finding information on an address.
350.47s - 352.19s |  So this is Master Lock here.
352.19s - 354.39s |  If you put in their address there
354.39s - 356.83s |  and you put file type PDF, it shows only things
356.83s - 359.71s |  that have the address listed in that PDF.
359.71s - 362.51s |  So I found one down here named Restricted Information.
362.51s - 365.91s |  And so, of course, I want to click on it.
365.91s - 367.47s |  And when I click on it, I find it
367.47s - 370.51s |  is a template for how they fire people, which
370.51s - 373.19s |  is really interesting to have on the open internet.
373.19s - 377.79s |  It's good to know that it's available.
377.79s - 380.29s |  So if you ever want to scare someone who works at Master Lock,
380.29s - 382.59s |  feel free to send it to them.
382.59s - 385.51s |  And not to pick on them, but I did find another thing.
385.51s - 387.67s |  This is a great social engineering avenue, right?
387.67s - 390.75s |  So you have a contract between the state of Wisconsin
390.75s - 392.07s |  and Master Lock, right?
392.07s - 393.63s |  And at the bottom, you see there's
393.63s - 396.87s |  the name and phone number and email of that contact.
396.87s - 398.97s |  So what you can do is become a middleman, right?
398.97s - 401.27s |  And that's just finding something on the open internet.
401.27s - 404.99s |  You don't have to go through that person's email just
404.99s - 406.07s |  to find this information.
406.07s - 410.19s |  I don't know why it's on Google, but it's a great social
410.19s - 412.47s |  engineering avenue.
412.47s - 415.67s |  So next up, just as I said, commercial properties
415.67s - 416.47s |  are great.
416.47s - 419.51s |  So very few companies own their offices.
419.51s - 422.39s |  So they rent from a high-rise, stuff like that.
422.39s - 425.11s |  And everyone right now is looking to rent, right?
425.11s - 427.75s |  Everyone wants to get someone in their space.
427.75s - 430.23s |  So they post those floor plans.
430.23s - 434.59s |  They post what other large companies are there.
434.59s - 436.95s |  So you want to go there, you know?
436.95s - 439.63s |  And they're very uniform in the way that they're stacked.
439.63s - 442.35s |  So if you get one floor plan for a floor,
442.35s - 446.13s |  it's typically going to be the same all the way up.
446.13s - 450.89s |  So this is the new tool that I found for this year.
450.89s - 452.81s |  It's called GeoSpy AI.
452.81s - 456.97s |  So it works by you put an image right into the browser.
456.97s - 458.17s |  You can pay for an API.
458.17s - 460.81s |  I don't feel like there's a need for it quite yet.
460.81s - 462.93s |  And you get stuff like this.
462.93s - 465.93s |  So if you see on the right side there, it's on my phone.
465.93s - 469.69s |  You can see it shows approximate location of where it is.
469.69s - 471.89s |  So this photo was actually taken in Shanghai,
471.89s - 473.85s |  but it said it was in Hong Kong.
473.85s - 476.73s |  So it's approximately 760 miles away.
476.73s - 478.29s |  Not a great look.
478.29s - 480.89s |  However, it does work on different locations.
480.89s - 483.17s |  It's really good at getting a baseline of where
483.17s - 485.77s |  this image was taken, and then you have to verify, right?
485.77s - 489.73s |  So this one, if you can see on the right, it is a bit small.
489.73s - 493.05s |  It's three kilometers away from the actual target location.
493.05s - 496.33s |  So that is a very good baseline for just throwing
496.33s - 501.61s |  an image into a tool and shooting out this information.
501.61s - 505.09s |  Finally, I'm going to go over a applied OSINT vignette.
505.09s - 511.61s |  So I'm going to go walk through a small investigation I did.
511.61s - 513.93s |  It involved a massage parlor.
513.93s - 519.09s |  It was for a bit of a, what's the word?
519.09s - 522.49s |  Information gathering for a local department.
522.49s - 524.57s |  So this is just Google image reviews, right?
524.57s - 526.49s |  Or Google review images.
526.49s - 527.93s |  You can see on the left-most side,
527.93s - 529.51s |  that is just an image of the hallway.
529.51s - 532.65s |  You see there's three doors, and then on the second image,
532.65s - 534.35s |  you can see that there's a monitor there.
534.35s - 535.77s |  That monitor is really interesting
535.77s - 537.73s |  because every single room has one.
537.73s - 542.45s |  So what that has is every camera location, right?
542.45s - 545.25s |  So whoever's inside can see what's going on on the outside.
545.25s - 546.93s |  And then on the right, you can actually
546.93s - 550.41s |  see one of those cameras above that door.
550.41s - 552.13s |  So as I said, cameras, right?
552.13s - 553.93s |  So if you're doing an OSINT investigation,
553.93s - 556.17s |  you always want to see entrances, egresses,
556.17s - 557.37s |  and especially those cameras.
557.37s - 560.35s |  Because if you're going to do a pen test or something
560.35s - 562.77s |  like that, you probably don't want to get caught by those.
562.77s - 565.89s |  So on the left here, we have one large camera on the roof.
565.89s - 568.69s |  And it's pointing at the first three parking lot spots
568.69s - 571.09s |  and further back behind them.
571.09s - 573.85s |  Additionally, you have the camera on the right in red.
573.85s - 574.97s |  And that's facing the door.
574.97s - 578.85s |  So it has an image of anyone trying to enter that location.
578.85s - 580.45s |  And then there's a back door if you go.
580.45s - 581.69s |  It's just Google Maps, right?
581.69s - 583.69s |  Street view, you drop the pin.
583.69s - 585.49s |  You can look around a building, and there's
585.49s - 587.77s |  another camera there based on that back entrance.
587.77s - 589.25s |  But it's only facing one way.
589.25s - 590.97s |  So if you wanted to enter from the back,
590.97s - 594.77s |  you could go from, I think this was the east-facing side.
594.77s - 598.45s |  So you'd go from the west, and then no one would know.
598.45s - 601.47s |  And then, as I said, the four buildings, right?
601.47s - 603.83s |  If you want to confirm, especially
603.83s - 606.75s |  for smaller strip malls and houses like that,
606.75s - 609.39s |  you can see everyone likes HVAC units now.
609.39s - 612.27s |  It's how you cool your house, your building.
612.27s - 615.83s |  You can see the piping goes to four different locations.
615.83s - 618.35s |  So that approximately, it's like there's
618.35s - 620.47s |  four different rooms that need to be cooled, right?
620.47s - 623.89s |  So in this photo here, you can see there's three,
623.89s - 625.55s |  and then there's another one behind it.
625.55s - 627.35s |  So you're not able to see it in this photo.
627.35s - 629.95s |  That's great about cross-referencing
629.95s - 632.07s |  with different photos.
632.07s - 636.55s |  And then finally, we have a wiggle.net example.
636.55s - 638.71s |  So for this, it shows, if anyone's
638.71s - 640.19s |  familiar with war driving, right?
640.19s - 643.03s |  It shows all the networks down in the bottom on the street.
643.03s - 646.59s |  No one turned up into that actual lot, unfortunately.
646.59s - 649.95s |  However, you can see all those networks, and some of them
649.95s - 651.63s |  with varying levels of security.
651.63s - 655.63s |  And it shows a MAC address and the SSID.
655.63s - 658.39s |  So going back on what I said before,
658.39s - 661.79s |  it's really useful to know what manufacturer
661.99s - 664.67s |  made that router for exploitation
664.67s - 667.71s |  and stuff like that.
667.71s - 670.75s |  It's a great addition to investigations,
670.75s - 674.31s |  stuff like that.
674.31s - 680.43s |  Any questions?
680.43s - 682.87s |  That was really quick, so I wasn't expecting that.
682.87s - 687.76s |  All right, thank you.
687.76s - 690.10s |  Oh, yeah.
690.10s - 711.34s |  Yeah, I can take questions down here.
711.34s - 712.18s |  Mic down here?
712.18s - 720.53s |  OK, perfect.
720.53s - 733.90s |  Yeah, I can hand this one to him.
733.90s - 736.06s |  I think that one's on now.
736.06s - 741.02s |  So once you get beyond the online research,
741.02s - 749.10s |  can you talk a bit about the in-person surveillance aspects?
749.10s - 754.26s |  So the question was the shift from online to in-person.
754.26s - 762.48s |  That shifts more to tactical surveillance measures.
762.48s - 765.84s |  So you've got your camera, you've got the black van,
765.84s - 767.28s |  inserting bugs and stuff like that.
767.28s - 769.52s |  I don't have much experience in that field.
769.52s - 771.76s |  That's where you'd shift towards that social engineering
771.76s - 772.56s |  aspect as well.
772.56s - 774.60s |  I can speak a little bit on the social engineering
774.60s - 777.40s |  rather than the covert intelligence gathering.
777.40s - 781.04s |  So with those ID badges and with those photos
781.04s - 783.08s |  you can specifically find on LinkedIn,
783.08s - 785.68s |  you can throw together a get up that looks pretty legitimate.
785.68s - 788.72s |  And then you can have your own free will, whatever
788.72s - 791.76s |  building you want to enter.
791.76s - 795.80s |  Additionally, carrying a lot of stuff,
795.80s - 799.60s |  like two, three boxes of donuts, a ladder,
799.60s - 800.92s |  two buckets of paint.
800.92s - 803.60s |  Tons of people love to hold doors open for you.
803.60s - 806.28s |  And I know everyone gets training on that to not do
806.28s - 810.40s |  that, but everyone forgets it in the moment.
810.40s - 813.16s |  So I'd highly recommend just picking up a hard hat,
813.16s - 817.24s |  picking up a high-vis vest, and seeing where that gets you.
817.24s - 818.70s |  And then from there, once you're in,
818.70s - 820.60s |  you gain access to a lot of that information
820.60s - 822.28s |  that's not open source.
822.28s - 824.88s |  So you get access to desks, stuff like that.
824.88s - 827.44s |  So it's always great to carry a set of common access keys
827.44s - 830.40s |  on you, just so you can open those cabinets
830.40s - 832.60s |  and get access to documents that people are like, oh,
832.60s - 833.36s |  it's in my office.
833.36s - 834.84s |  There's no need to secure it anymore
834.84s - 837.40s |  than putting it in my desk.
837.40s - 853.20s |  But yeah, does that answer your question?
853.20s - 854.24s |  All good.
854.24s - 857.48s |  Maybe this is a silly question, but you
857.48s - 862.40s |  talked about working for a local authority.
862.40s - 863.88s |  How do they approach you?
863.88s - 867.76s |  Is this part of your job, part of your studies,
867.76s - 873.64s |  or do you do any investigations of your own initiative?
873.64s - 876.64s |  So the question was how I referenced
876.64s - 883.60s |  that I worked with a local department for the OSINT vignette
883.60s - 884.40s |  that I showed.
884.40s - 888.48s |  So I work for another volunteer organization
888.48s - 890.16s |  in open source intelligence.
890.16s - 891.84s |  And I just give them the information.
891.84s - 894.76s |  I'm not involved in, it's very compartmentalized.
894.84s - 897.00s |  So I don't know what they do with that information.
897.00s - 901.08s |  I just find it and then make an intelligence report
901.08s - 902.96s |  kind of thing.
902.96s - 905.68s |  They did a lot of good work around the Super Bowl.
905.68s - 908.96s |  Every Super Bowl, they do OSINT investigations
908.96s - 911.04s |  based on human trafficking.
911.04s - 914.52s |  And it shifts from that missing persons cases
914.52s - 915.40s |  to human trafficking.
915.40s - 920.00s |  It's kind of similar, but it's a little bit more harder,
920.00s - 920.52s |  for sure.
920.52s - 923.28s |  But it does have that same sort of satisfaction
923.28s - 939.32s |  that I'm being helpful.
939.32s - 940.28s |  I think that's a wrap.
940.28s - 942.52s |  Thank you so much for coming out.
