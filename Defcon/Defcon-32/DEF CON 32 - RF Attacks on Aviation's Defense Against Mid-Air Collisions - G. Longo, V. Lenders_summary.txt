**Introduction to TCAS and RF Attacks**
- **Aviation's Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) II**: Introduced in the 1980s as a safety net to prevent mid-air collisions.
- **Vulnerability**: Recent findings show TCAS II can be compromised, allowing hijacking of displays and creation of fake Traffic Advisories (TAs) and Resolution Advisories (RAs).
- **Research Discovery**: A new attack can remotely disable TCAS, risking mid-air collisions.

**Presenters and Background**
- **Vincent Lenders**: Cybersecurity researcher with over 20 years of experience, director of the Cyber Defense Campus in Switzerland.
- **Giacomo**: Third-year PhD student from Italy, specializing in radio security of aviation and maritime systems.

**Air Traffic Control Systems**
- **Importance**: Key infrastructure for safe air travel, managing over 30 million flights per year.
- **Technologies**: 
  - **Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR)**: Oldest technology, relies on radar interrogation.
  - **Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)**: More precise, aircraft determine their position using GNSS.
  - **Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)**: Focus of the talk, last line of defense against collisions.

**TCAS Functions and Importance**
- **Core Functions**: Surveillance, Traffic Advisory, and Resolution Advisories.
- **Importance**: Prevents catastrophic events like aircraft collisions, mandatory in many airspaces.

**Security Concerns and Research**
- **Past Warnings**: Various risk assessments and simulations have been conducted.
- **Experimental Analysis**: Previous attempts lacked convincing evidence of TCAS attack feasibility.
- **Research Motivation**: To provide scientific evidence and methodology for testing TCAS attacks.

**Technical Challenges and Testbed Setup**
- **Protocol Limitations**: TCAS protocol from 1987 lacks encryption; insecurity is known.
- **Testbed Architecture**: Includes a TCAS unit, control panel, traffic display, and measuring equipment.
- **Challenges**: Building a system to test TCAS attacks, requiring precise timing and hardware.

**Attack Methodology**
- **Inducing a TA**: Requires broadcasting presence, replying to interrogations, and being in the correct position.
- **Triggering an RA**: Involves negotiation between aircraft, selecting addresses for conflict resolution.
- **Disabling TCAS**: Exploits sensitivity level adjustments from ground stations without authentication.

**Experimental Results and Findings**
- **Success Rate**: High success rate in testing attacks, with success rate around 98%.
- **Cost and Feasibility**: Achieved with less than $10,000 using commercial off-the-shelf hardware.
- **Limitations**: Power requirements and precise positioning needed for effective attacks.

**Conclusion and Future Implications**
- **Implications**: Highlighted the systemic problem in TCAS security, requiring industry attention.
- **Disclosure**: Findings disclosed to manufacturers and authorities, with no immediate fix available.
- **Future Work**: Ongoing work on new collision avoidance standards and a forthcoming scientific paper.
