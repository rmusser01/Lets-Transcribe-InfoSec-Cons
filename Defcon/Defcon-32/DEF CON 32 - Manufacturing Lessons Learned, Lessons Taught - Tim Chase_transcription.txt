Manufacturer\u2019s OT network environments increasingly are set up as a network or hyper connected IIoT devices, where all data goes to the cloud and often comes back from the cloud to offer changes, and all participants have access into the OT network domain allowing manufacturing to push the boundaries of what products are technically possible, what production efficiencies are possible, and how OT environments can scale as never before.\n\nThis has obviously come with downside risks that manufacturers are only now beginning to grapple with and to make meaningful changes to better protect their networks and the gains they have made. Their growing pains can serve as roadmap of what to do and what not to do as many other OT intensive industry verticals are moving very quickly into similar use cases.",

0.00s - 4.96s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 My name is Tim Chase, and for the better part of a decade, I have supported a number of
4.96s - 10.36s |  different critical and vital infrastructures, primarily by working in what are called information
10.36s - 15.58s |  sharing and analysis centers for a number of different kind of sector-specific ISACs
15.58s - 18.44s |  and ISAUs.
18.44s - 24.04s |  So this talk is not about what ISACs are, and it's not about specifically what the manufacturing
24.04s - 28.84s |  ISAC is, but if you're interested in what ISACs are, what they do, how they kind of
28.84s - 33.00s |  work in the overall sort of information security space, I'd love to talk with you about that
33.00s - 38.88s |  or manufacturing ISAC if you have any questions about that or any other topic after the presentation.
38.88s - 44.20s |  And depending on how quickly I go, there might even be time for Q&A if you guys have any
44.20s - 45.20s |  questions.
45.20s - 50.96s |  So a couple of things about manufacturing before we get going.
50.96s - 54.36s |  Manufacturing is defined by the United States government and some other entities as like
54.36s - 60.44s |  an industry vertical, and I've worked now sort of for manufacturing ISAC and leading
60.44s - 66.52s |  that for two and a half-ish years, and it's the first industry vertical that's not really
66.52s - 67.52s |  a vertical.
67.52s - 68.52s |  It's not a vertical.
68.52s - 72.74s |  It's actually like a horizontal modality that supports every single industry.
72.74s - 79.60s |  It's not discrete like oil and gases or finances or, you know, electrical or something.
79.60s - 85.68s |  And so it's kind of hard to generalize, and because of the size and type of manufacturing,
85.68s - 90.12s |  it's also hard to kind of generalize manufacturing.
90.12s - 94.52s |  With that said, we're going to make some generalizations about manufacturing.
94.52s - 98.16s |  So we're going to start off with the good news about manufacturing.
98.16s - 103.52s |  The good news is that manufacturers are really, really good at manufacturing, and I know that
103.52s - 104.52s |  goes without saying.
104.52s - 106.36s |  You're like, well, yeah, it's their business.
106.36s - 110.44s |  But I think that all of us could think of like other industries that they're not good
110.44s - 112.04s |  at their jobs.
112.04s - 114.64s |  But manufacturers are really great at manufacturing.
114.64s - 120.68s |  In fact, in human history, large portions of human history are essentially defined by
120.68s - 124.68s |  technologies that manufacturers created to be better manufacturers.
124.68s - 130.04s |  So whether that's use of water as a power source or steam or now electricity or, you
130.04s - 133.56s |  know, now digitization of the manufacturing space.
133.56s - 138.80s |  All of those were entirely or largely a result of sort of manufacturers wanting to manufacture
138.80s - 144.64s |  more, better, faster, and able to do that, they needed to find and harness new technologies.
144.64s - 150.74s |  So they're really good at not only embracing new technology, but actually creating technology
150.74s - 155.60s |  that didn't exist to facilitate manufacturing.
155.60s - 160.96s |  Now we've moved past the point that, you know, we're using electricity to kind of help automate
161.08s - 166.24s |  and we're using, you know, digital systems to help automate and increase productivity.
166.24s - 171.52s |  But now, manufacturing is moving headlong into that kind of cloud-based infrastructure,
171.52s - 177.40s |  which is heavily, you know, narrow AI and machine learning enabled to do a number of
177.40s - 178.64s |  different things.
178.64s - 187.12s |  I would say that I think about AI in manufacturing kind of the way that I do the Internet circa
187.12s - 189.12s |  1993 to 1995.
189.12s - 190.16s |  We know a few different things.
190.16s - 196.96s |  We know it's going to be a big deal and we already have a number of use cases that we're
196.96s - 199.64s |  using it for and it's phenomenal.
199.64s - 203.92s |  And then the third thing is we have enough, if we're being honest, humility to realize
203.92s - 209.28s |  we don't exactly know where it's going to go and how it's actually going to affect what
209.28s - 210.28s |  we do.
210.28s - 215.72s |  But, so there's sort of some similarities there in terms of new transformative technologies.
215.72s - 220.96s |  So the last thing about manufacturing, and this is actually a positive, I think, overall,
220.96s - 226.08s |  is that manufacturers are their production and profit motivated, right?
226.08s - 232.32s |  It's actually what helps them to focus on and get better at the manufacturing process.
232.32s - 237.68s |  And what I mean by that is that manufacturers, you know, are businesses and manufacturers
237.68s - 243.96s |  think how do I make as many widgets as possible, as fast as possible for the lowest unit cost
244.04s - 245.84s |  per widget as possible.
245.84s - 252.80s |  And so they make decisions based upon that framework and it makes them better manufacturers.
252.80s - 258.76s |  Now, with that being said, there are some downsides to that.
258.76s - 263.88s |  So the last point about how that framework that they use to determine where they're going
263.88s - 269.84s |  to spend resources and what they're going to prioritize, manufacturers are really, really
269.84s - 271.76s |  bad at cybersecurity.
271.76s - 277.28s |  And the reason is, as it turns out, cybersecurity doesn't make widgets.
277.28s - 281.28s |  And so when they're thinking and prioritizing in that framework, I want to make as many
281.28s - 287.88s |  widgets as possible, as fast as possible, as low unit costs as possible, the security
287.88s - 293.72s |  aspect usually loses out in that discussion.
293.72s - 300.12s |  That being said, as we know here, I mean, you're all here at DEF CON, there are consequences
300.20s - 304.52s |  from chronically under-resourcing security in that process.
304.52s - 309.24s |  And I think that a lot of those consequences are sort of coming home to roost for manufacturers,
309.24s - 315.00s |  especially as that attack surface is growing exponentially for them.
315.00s - 319.52s |  And there's just a lot more badness out there that can touch them.
319.52s - 321.98s |  Some of it's not even specifically directed at them.
321.98s - 325.34s |  Some of it is specifically directed at them.
325.34s - 329.22s |  One of those I would say is ransomware.
329.22s - 335.50s |  And there's a few reasons that ransomware operators really, really love manufacturers.
335.50s - 341.38s |  And the victimology is pretty narrow on what they're going after.
341.38s - 350.70s |  Number one, manufacturers' networks are typically flat and not really well segmented.
350.70s - 358.70s |  Number two, they oftentimes utilize enterprise ERP systems that everyone in that organization,
358.70s - 363.34s |  whether they're working in sales in the front office or they're working on the plant floor,
363.34s - 368.90s |  have access to, to see where manufacturing processes are in line and pull down necessary
368.90s - 372.54s |  files for manufacturing process or whatever.
372.54s - 378.62s |  That is a giant vulnerability because it requires, obviously, IT and internet access inside of
378.62s - 380.06s |  the plant floor.
380.42s - 388.38s |  But it's also why a lot of times, if there's only IT intrusions in a ransomware, for instance,
388.38s - 390.70s |  it could be other things as well.
390.70s - 396.46s |  But if you're like me and you read a lot of SEC 8K disclosures, they all kind of sound
396.46s - 404.22s |  the same, but they only ever reference IT compromise, unauthorized access into IT spaces.
404.22s - 409.10s |  But if you read between the lines and you see that there's been operational or manufacturing
409.10s - 411.02s |  compromise, you're like, well, how is that possible?
411.02s - 412.70s |  They only got into the IT.
412.70s - 414.02s |  Why is your plant down?
414.02s - 418.42s |  Why are you not producing furniture or Clorox bleach products or whatever?
418.42s - 424.06s |  And the answer is that the reliance on that ERP system, they can't generate orders.
424.06s - 428.02s |  They can't pull down the necessary files to load into manufacturing processes.
428.02s - 434.86s |  So compromising just an IT system has direct OT effects.
434.86s - 441.98s |  And because it's stopping production, even if it's only in the IT environment, manufacturers,
441.98s - 444.10s |  number one, pay quickly.
444.10s - 450.18s |  Number two, they're targeting sort of mid-level enterprises, manufacturers where they're large
450.18s - 454.66s |  enough to be able to pay a decent-sized ransom, but they're not large enough to have really
454.66s - 458.54s |  sophisticated sort of enterprise security solutions and the like.
458.54s - 464.34s |  So it's this kind of sweet spot that ransomware operators take advantage of routinely.
464.34s - 470.96s |  And so for the last two years especially, we track our organization and the parent company
470.96s - 473.54s |  that we're a part of, the Global Resilience Federation.
473.54s - 474.54s |  You can go.
474.54s - 478.90s |  I think the most recent semiannual ransomware report will be out in about a week.
478.90s - 481.86s |  It's free on our website, grf.org.
481.86s - 485.94s |  But our analysts, it's pretty time-consuming because our analysts have to actually go out
485.94s - 490.54s |  and scrape all the Torque leak sites about the data on the ransomware and the victims.
490.54s - 491.74s |  But we collect a lot of data.
491.74s - 494.62s |  We've got four years of data.
494.62s - 498.50s |  And just a few pieces of data that we collect are, number one, who the ransomware operator
498.50s - 500.92s |  was that had the victim.
500.92s - 502.50s |  Number two, who the victim was.
502.50s - 507.50s |  Number three, geographically, at least headquarter-wise, where the victim is located.
507.50s - 511.50s |  And number four, what industry that victim is.
511.50s - 515.76s |  And so we're able to kind of parse the data and see trends and the like.
515.76s - 519.50s |  And that's how we know ransomware is by far the most targeted industry.
519.50s - 523.82s |  I think a lot of different organizations, security researchers and the like, have said
523.82s - 528.62s |  that roughly speaking, about between two-thirds and three-quarters of all ransomware incidents
528.62s - 530.60s |  are focused at manufacturers.
530.60s - 533.84s |  So they really have a giant target on their back.
533.84s - 539.06s |  This is, I think, one of the things that, as we'll go and see, is actually helpful because
539.06s - 544.18s |  they had to learn some of the lessons of the bad decisions they were making to start making
544.18s - 546.42s |  good decisions.
546.42s - 549.10s |  So where do we go from here?
549.70s - 553.70s |  It's a pretty bad place, the security landscape.
553.70s - 559.14s |  I want to make a caveat here and say that, like I said, we couldn't generalize manufacturers.
559.14s - 563.34s |  There are manufacturers that are literally the most sophisticated from an operational
563.34s - 569.38s |  cyber perspective down to people that are maybe really large companies but are doing
569.38s - 570.70s |  almost nothing.
570.70s - 572.06s |  So it runs the gambit.
572.06s - 579.38s |  But again, we're going to kind of talk about generalities that I see.
579.38s - 583.02s |  Number one is that manufacturing is a little bit different.
583.02s - 587.18s |  And I know that I'm speaking on behalf of ICS Village and manufacturing does run a lot
587.18s - 590.42s |  of industrial protocols and the like.
590.42s - 597.66s |  But manufacturing is a little bit different in general because, well, first, in this space,
597.66s - 603.06s |  whether it's here at DEF CON or S4 or something, we hear a lot about IT-OT convergence.
603.06s - 607.38s |  And it's been a sort of buzzword bingo for the last almost 20 years.
607.38s - 612.10s |  The thing is, that term really doesn't apply to manufacturing for the most part.
612.10s - 616.86s |  And the reason is, you can't converge something that was never separated.
616.86s - 622.26s |  And most manufacturing networks were really never separated in a meaningful way, either
622.26s - 624.70s |  physically or logically.
624.70s - 626.46s |  And so that term really doesn't apply.
627.26s - 631.78s |  They're just basically running a network and some of it is used to send emails and some
631.78s - 634.26s |  of it is used on the plant floor.
634.26s - 640.22s |  Again, generalizing, sometimes they're really big, but still, in general, that's commonly
640.22s - 641.38s |  the case.
641.38s - 645.94s |  Number two is the networks themselves are becoming less industrial.
645.94s - 652.26s |  The last presentation was showing that converter from a serial connection that was running
652.26s - 655.38s |  Modbus to an IP connection.
656.30s - 658.14s |  That's very common.
658.14s - 663.58s |  Legacy systems might have one of those dongles that is changing from a legacy protocol and
663.58s - 667.34s |  a serial connection to a more kind of IP-centric network.
667.34s - 669.06s |  But that's the way that things are going.
669.06s - 671.14s |  There's a lot of reasons for that.
671.14s - 675.30s |  Some of those are mainly having to do with the technology leap sort of into the cloud
675.30s - 679.98s |  and AI enablement, meaning that the speed that things need to flow, the data needs to
679.98s - 684.84s |  flow at, and how much data needs to transit that network, you're not going to do that
684.84s - 691.24s |  on simple serial networks.
691.24s - 694.36s |  And I say the networks are becoming less industrial, not the nodes.
694.36s - 697.76s |  At the end of the day, there's still going to be an industrial process going on and they
697.76s - 703.48s |  might have, at least for that thing, some proprietary protocol for the process itself,
703.48s - 707.68s |  but the network on the plant floor, and it could be multiple locations, multiple production
707.68s - 715.12s |  facilities, they're not like kind of older school serial networks.
715.12s - 717.62s |  That is a challenge.
717.62s - 719.36s |  It makes it easier to build out.
719.36s - 722.28s |  And he was also talking about the use of Wi-Fi in industrial applications.
722.28s - 724.88s |  That is becoming increasingly common.
724.88s - 728.28s |  Also, those aren't necessarily the best secured.
728.28s - 732.48s |  The thinking that they have is like in the same way that people used to think about industrial
732.48s - 737.60s |  networks and why they didn't do security in it at all was, well, the network sort of ends
737.72s - 738.72s |  at the fence line.
738.72s - 743.16s |  So we don't have to worry about securing that inside, but that's not true.
743.16s - 745.16s |  We all know that that's not true.
745.16s - 753.56s |  Okay, so manufacturing is sort of, everyone is focusing now on manufacturing from a sales
753.56s - 758.24s |  and vendor perspective, solutions providers, all of a sudden, my phone rings a lot more
758.24s - 763.26s |  from those people that want to discuss manufacturing because they're really sweet on manufacturing.
763.26s - 768.30s |  But one of the things we need to consider, because manufacturing is different, is that
768.30s - 774.58s |  any of those solutions, which they do need them, they need to be able to extend to less
774.58s - 776.36s |  industrial applications.
776.36s - 781.30s |  So we have really, and I'm not going to name names, but we all can think of them like so
781.30s - 782.82s |  telepathy out to everyone.
782.82s - 787.86s |  There are really great organizations that have incredible industrial network security
787.86s - 790.62s |  tooling.
790.62s - 796.58s |  And there are really great tools for cloud security, but there's not really something
796.58s - 802.50s |  that's kind of going all the way from base metal to AI-enabled cloud infrastructure.
802.50s - 807.46s |  And so there's seams in that security, even if you implemented all the tools that are
807.46s - 810.26s |  currently available.
810.26s - 815.90s |  And even in that industrial network, the applications and the types of manufacturing that's going
815.90s - 819.42s |  on is becoming, I say less industrial.
819.42s - 824.82s |  It's essentially moving more towards sort of an IT-like landscape where manufacturing
824.82s - 829.50s |  devices are sort of just nodes at the end of an IT network, no different than a printer.
829.50s - 837.42s |  You can send it commands, but it doesn't look like legacy ICS environments.
837.42s - 841.42s |  Number two, I already mentioned that it needs to extend up to sort of cloud environments
841.42s - 847.08s |  to seal off some of those security gaps that we have from tooling from an ICS environment
847.08s - 849.92s |  or a sort of cloud environment.
849.92s - 854.52s |  And then number three, and this is really important, is it needs to extend down to smaller
854.52s - 855.76s |  manufacturers.
855.76s - 860.64s |  Most manufacturers, there are over a hundred thousand in the United States alone, are very
860.64s - 863.76s |  small organizations, very small organizations.
863.76s - 867.24s |  Prior to this, I didn't have enough time to do a site survey and take some pictures for
867.24s - 872.12s |  slides and stuff to make it look pretty, but I was going to go to a manufacturer that they
872.12s - 874.24s |  make cardboard boxes.
874.36s - 878.40s |  Some of them are really intricate in terms of cutting and everything that have multiple
878.40s - 883.22s |  folds and display stands and all that kind of stuff, but they don't have a lot going
883.22s - 885.84s |  on from a security perspective.
885.84s - 890.60s |  Some of that is okay because some of their systems don't really connect directly to IT
890.60s - 894.40s |  networks, but it doesn't, yeah.
894.40s - 899.48s |  It needs, some of these tools need to be able to go down and scale down, not just up.
899.48s - 902.96s |  And then I put in here, don't forget the cyber poor, and that kind of goes back to those
902.96s - 904.72s |  small manufacturers.
904.72s - 912.96s |  Most of my members are large organizations, they're global Fortune 500 or even 100 companies,
912.96s - 917.04s |  but their supply chains are really small.
917.04s - 921.72s |  It gets really small really, really quickly that are their upstream suppliers.
921.72s - 929.54s |  And so at Manufacturing ISAC, we're working currently with Don Capelli, OT CERT, to create
929.54s - 935.22s |  kind of free training and training modules for those organizations completely free of
935.22s - 939.46s |  charge, working with some of the larger vendors to bring them in to get their supply chains
939.46s - 943.38s |  to try to reach some of those organizations that need the help.
943.38s - 947.22s |  Some of them don't know they need the help, but to try to connect them to those resources.
947.22s - 953.06s |  So maybe next year I can let you know how that endeavor goes.
953.06s - 957.86s |  So we've talked about where manufacturing was.
957.86s - 964.62s |  They've always been sort of a global leader in technology, not only adoption, but creation
964.62s - 966.30s |  of new technology.
966.30s - 969.46s |  And they've sort of fallen behind in that security.
969.46s - 974.34s |  And I think that it's because they haven't understood that that security is actually
974.34s - 976.18s |  part of their manufacturing process.
976.18s - 979.18s |  It needs to be thought of as part of the process itself.
979.18s - 983.70s |  And every single business does many, many different things that may not be, as you think
983.70s - 990.30s |  about it, you know, discreetly aligned with that business and what you do, but you still
990.30s - 991.30s |  have to do it anyway.
991.30s - 993.74s |  You know, you have like HR folks and you do payroll.
993.74s - 997.42s |  Well, that's not making potato chips if you make potato chips, but it's still an important
997.42s - 1000.14s |  process nonetheless.
1000.14s - 1005.26s |  So here's why I think that, you know, manufacturers will go from cyber deniers to security high
1005.26s - 1006.26s |  flyers.
1006.26s - 1010.56s |  It's because generally speaking, it's in their DNA to innovate.
1010.56s - 1014.92s |  They just haven't recognized yet that that needs to be a part of what they need to do.
1014.92s - 1020.64s |  And this ultimately is sort of that top line, that executive leadership.
1020.64s - 1024.56s |  When they get the idea that this is something, this is the innovation they need to do to
1024.56s - 1025.56s |  make things work.
1025.56s - 1030.12s |  So if they're looking at the new hotness of whatever that cloud infrastructure is going
1030.12s - 1034.08s |  to help them do to move to the next level, if they understand that a part of that is
1034.08s - 1040.24s |  security and that that security needs to move up and down, that buy-in is going to
1040.24s - 1047.80s |  potentially allow them to leapfrog over some other industries that are, well, they're currently
1047.80s - 1054.40s |  seen as more security mature in their ICS industrial programs.
1054.40s - 1058.88s |  I actually think that this is basically the core, the heart of the talk.
1058.88s - 1064.40s |  I actually think that manufacturing, while they're doing a terrible job right now, if
1064.40s - 1070.28s |  I come back in a year where currently there are not tools that do all of those things
1070.28s - 1072.68s |  that I just talked about, I think there will be.
1072.68s - 1078.32s |  And I think that the manufacturers themselves will be some of the ones to, at least in partnership
1078.32s - 1084.08s |  with new vendors or on their own, will actually create those tools.
1084.08s - 1089.84s |  And then as they mature and utilize those tools and that process long enough, where
1089.84s - 1094.72s |  other industries that are in that ICS environment that are thinking about and want to use some
1094.72s - 1100.00s |  of those tools and want to move into a cloud environment, they're sort of fence sitters
1100.00s - 1103.48s |  and they're going to wait and watch to see what happens to the manufacturers.
1103.48s - 1105.76s |  Let them be the canaries in the coal mine.
1105.76s - 1110.24s |  And when nothing bad happens, you're going to start to see that they're going to adopt
1110.24s - 1112.66s |  that type of technology in the future, I believe.
1112.66s - 1115.08s |  So check back with me on that.
1115.08s - 1117.70s |  So it all starts with the executive leadership.
1117.70s - 1119.06s |  They're the ones that steer the ship.
1119.06s - 1122.06s |  They're the ones that do the resourcing.
1122.06s - 1126.42s |  And they have a couple of things that are pushing them.
1126.42s - 1132.98s |  Number one is that they're looking at what's happening currently inside of the manufacturing
1132.98s - 1133.98s |  space.
1133.98s - 1139.02s |  They're looking at their competitors and their vendors and suppliers getting popped every
1139.02s - 1140.02s |  single day.
1140.34s - 1146.10s |  Oftentimes with ransomware, sometimes other, but they're being affected.
1146.10s - 1151.00s |  And as a result, they have to understand that the crosshairs are on them too.
1151.00s - 1155.18s |  So it kind of focuses their attention.
1155.18s - 1159.10s |  That being said, I think that generally speaking, the meetings that I have with a lot of those
1159.10s - 1166.90s |  executives, my opinion is that most of them are not necessarily thinking correctly about
1166.90s - 1168.62s |  the decisions they've made.
1168.62s - 1173.74s |  They don't actually understand the risks that they're accepting in the business, not
1173.74s - 1176.22s |  doing something.
1176.22s - 1177.22s |  That's changing now.
1177.22s - 1180.10s |  I think they understand.
1180.10s - 1181.10s |  I want to go over there.
1181.10s - 1183.54s |  I've been going over there after this.
1183.54s - 1187.38s |  I think they're understanding now how much risk they're accepting by not doing certain
1187.38s - 1188.38s |  things.
1188.38s - 1190.72s |  So that's one of the things that's changing.
1190.72s - 1197.08s |  Number two, it doesn't hurt that there are new sort of compliance and regulatory requirements
1197.08s - 1199.68s |  on them that also are focusing their attention.
1199.68s - 1201.36s |  So it's not new.
1201.36s - 1207.52s |  It's new-ish, but SEC requirements that require them to have certain officers in their company
1207.52s - 1213.00s |  that have certain roles for information security and cybersecurity.
1213.00s - 1219.08s |  The new CERCIA Act is going to change some things too, because now they're going to have
1219.08s - 1222.00s |  to report a lot of the things that they didn't before.
1222.00s - 1228.72s |  I also see that some of the more traditionally cyber-mature industries, a lot of that talent
1228.72s - 1230.72s |  is moving to manufacturing.
1230.72s - 1234.92s |  So on most of the calls, 70% of the time, one of those people who's leading that security
1234.92s - 1239.80s |  program, a CISO or someone else, is coming from finance or someplace else that has a
1239.80s - 1243.16s |  more mature process.
1243.16s - 1246.48s |  So the next question is, do I see any change now?
1246.48s - 1249.12s |  Because I'm telling you what I think will happen in the future, but is there anything
1249.12s - 1250.60s |  happening now?
1250.60s - 1254.16s |  The answer is kind of, maybe some glimmers.
1254.16s - 1256.56s |  This is messy data, so you don't need to look at the data.
1256.56s - 1258.72s |  The colors are the only thing that matter, really.
1258.72s - 1260.68s |  But I told you about that ransomware report.
1260.68s - 1265.32s |  So in our semi-annual and annual ransomware report, the weekly ransomware report is more
1265.32s - 1268.36s |  tactical, just a lot more data on the victims.
1268.36s - 1272.04s |  The semi-annual and the annual are sort of higher level and talk about trends in that
1272.04s - 1273.44s |  landscape.
1273.44s - 1278.40s |  And so I had to write my portions for the communities that I lead, including manufacturing.
1278.40s - 1279.40s |  So this is manufacturing.
1279.40s - 1281.36s |  So I'm just kind of dumping some of the data.
1281.36s - 1286.80s |  And this was whether or not, for each one of those weeks, whether manufacturing was
1286.80s - 1288.36s |  the most targeted sector.
1288.36s - 1289.36s |  Okay?
1289.36s - 1293.56s |  So every single week, we got the top sector targeted, right?
1293.56s - 1298.72s |  The rightmost column was, well actually, the first four or five columns are like this past
1298.72s - 1300.32s |  six months that I was writing on.
1300.32s - 1304.56s |  But then I was like, well, I should probably look at the previous six months too, to kind
1304.56s - 1307.14s |  of do a compare and contrast over that time period.
1307.14s - 1313.32s |  So the rightmost column is the Q3, Q4 of 2023.
1313.32s - 1318.94s |  And then the other column that's kind of in the center is the first six months, Q1, Q2
1318.94s - 1320.76s |  of 2024.
1320.76s - 1327.70s |  There's a lot more red in the far right hand column, the second half of 2023, and a lot
1327.70s - 1336.74s |  less red in the first half of 2024, 40% less times they were the most targeted sector for
1337.34s - 1342.82s |  that week, and a 20% overall reduction in the amount of victims.
1342.82s - 1346.42s |  Now, I think it's too soon to tell whether this is like a real change.
1346.42s - 1352.70s |  I also would note that we saw that they were, the victims themselves were moving down in
1352.70s - 1357.02s |  organizational size, which means that some of those midsize organizations that do have
1357.02s - 1364.74s |  means in order to improve their situation are doing that, and they're becoming not victims.
1364.74s - 1366.58s |  So anyway, there's my glimmers of hope.
1366.58s - 1370.90s |  I've got one minute, and so I don't know if that's long enough for Q&A, but we can
1370.90s - 1373.10s |  try if anyone has a question.
1373.10s - 1378.68s |  I can't see anyone.
1378.68s - 1379.68s |  No questions?
1379.68s - 1395.91s |  A question.
1395.91s - 1398.95s |  How to make cybersecurity sexy for manufacturing?
1398.95s - 1402.83s |  I honestly don't think we can, because at the end of the day, they're business.
1402.83s - 1407.07s |  They're making decisions based upon business, but I think that that's a strong enough case
1407.07s - 1415.78s |  for them to do the right thing, I think, but we'll see.
1415.78s - 1419.74s |  Maybe one more, and then I'll jump down, but we can talk afterwards.
1419.74s - 1420.74s |  All right.
1420.74s - 1421.74s |  Well, thanks, everybody.
1421.74s - 1425.50s |  I want to go see what's next door.
