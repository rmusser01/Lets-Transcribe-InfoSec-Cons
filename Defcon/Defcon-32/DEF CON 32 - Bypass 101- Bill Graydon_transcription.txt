0.00s - 3.94s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Welcome. Can everyone hear me alright? Everyone see the screen except for what is not
3.94s - 10.58s |  loading. So, now is the part of the talk where you wholeheartedly boo the speaker for not
10.58s - 15.78s |  downloading his own slides locally before relying on the Defcon wifi to give the talk. So
15.78s - 22.61s |  let's let's hear it. Big ol' big ol' boo for my lack of preparedness. I fucked it up
22.61s - 27.61s |  already. So, this is actually a little bit appropriate though given a lot of what I'm
27.61s - 33.31s |  going to talk about. Because what you, if you were here for the talk an hour ago when we
33.31s - 37.71s |  with Physical Security Village gave the Bypass 101 talk, we were talking about all the
37.71s - 44.23s |  elite hacks that you can do to hack into physical systems and get them to behave in ways
44.23s - 49.77s |  that they're not supposed to. A lot of what this talk is gonna end up converging on is not
49.77s - 54.37s |  doing advanced elite hacks yourself, but just systems that don't work the way they're
54.37s - 61.71s |  supposed to in the first place. And wifi as we're seeing is one of them. So, we'll we'll get
61.71s - 66.77s |  the vis- visuals that we can and I'll talk you through the rest. But um, every time you
66.77s - 71.81s |  see one of these images that doesn't load, keep in mind that is the exact same failure mode
71.81s - 77.85s |  as a lot of physical security systems that don't operate as intended and that's some of the
77.87s - 84.86s |  things that we're gonna focus on in this talk. So, we're gonna go over a bunch of very high
87.66s - 93.74s |  level of the type of bypasses, type of security that we need to concern about. So, bypass, lock
93.74s - 98.04s |  picking, forcible entry, we'll talk about that a little bit. Alarm and detection and then
98.04s - 102.92s |  surveillance. We'll have to focus on how to bring it up and how to get action. All of this in
102.92s - 109.32s |  the context of an internal employee where your main job description is not auditing the
109.34s - 112.78s |  company's physical security. So, there's a lot of people and we get a lot of questions at the
112.78s - 118.58s |  village about this. People that notice flaws in their employer's physical security wonder how
118.58s - 124.62s |  to bring it up, what's important and so that's what we're gonna talk about here. And I'm gonna
124.62s - 131.06s |  hammer this through throughout the talk. A lot of what is most critical to bring up is stupid
131.06s - 138.11s |  shit. So, let's watch some videos of stupid shit. If we can. Alright, so the door is locked.
138.89s - 143.89s |  Doesn't open. Hit the uh, hit the accessibility button. And it pops right open. So this is a
149.69s - 154.47s |  surprisingly common failure mode. It is a simple misconfiguration in the programming
154.47s - 160.97s |  software or in the wiring. When it's a wiring problem, it is just, it thinks this is the
160.97s - 165.91s |  accessibility button on the inside, the secure side of the door and it causes that system to
165.91s - 172.89s |  unlock the door and cause it to open up. So stupid shit, misconfigurations like that. You
172.89s - 177.89s |  also get stupid shit like this. Lock cage. Reach around. Slam the bar and you're through.
184.82s - 191.06s |  There's a couple reasons that stupid shit like this is so relevant to security in general but
191.06s - 197.16s |  also to internal employees bringing it up. Number one from security in general is a threat
197.16s - 201.70s |  modeling perspective. Hitting the accessibility button, reaching around, that's
201.70s - 206.70s |  something that any idiot can look at and see, this is something that might work and they can
206.70s - 212.74s |  try it. It takes no skill whatsoever. When you're bringing up flaws to particularly your own
212.74s - 218.12s |  employer, the less skill it takes, the better in terms of them understanding the
218.12s - 224.48s |  criticality of that problem. If it's a, an advanced, high skilled, high barrier to entry
224.48s - 229.72s |  attack that you're demonstrating, the more it shows off your skills as an attacker, the less
229.72s - 236.76s |  relevant it is from a threat modeling perspective. And so that is why systems that just plain
236.76s - 241.76s |  old don't work, like wifi sometimes, is, is something that uh, is most relevant for this. So
245.76s - 251.94s |  I'm gonna switch off of the presenter mode here and we'll see what we can see. So latch
251.94s - 257.14s |  targeted bypass is something that we talk about in bypass 101. And the physical security
257.14s - 263.22s |  village right across the hall here, quick show of hands, who has uh, checked us out so far? Lot
263.22s - 266.98s |  of people. For those who haven't, I highly recommend it. Everything I'm gonna talk about in
266.98s - 273.46s |  this talk you can try it for yourself in the village. These latches allow self-closing doors
273.46s - 279.10s |  to self-latch and self-lock afterwards. You can often stick a tool in just like we're showing
279.10s - 285.10s |  in this picture here and retract that latch, pull the door open. So again, really low
285.10s - 291.18s |  skilled, easy to demonstrate, easy to show to someone at your workplace of anyone with a bent
291.18s - 297.02s |  wire can do this and open this locked door. And that's something that really gets, gets
297.02s - 303.92s |  results there. This dead latch is what's meant to prevent that. That little half moon there.
303.92s - 308.56s |  Those half moon designs by the way are terrible because if that dead latch is retracted it
308.56s - 313.00s |  will prevent you from pushing it in. You can try that out in the village. When it falls into
313.00s - 318.00s |  the strike plate hole, that allows you to do that latch targeted bypass. So bypasses that are
320.80s - 327.80s |  easy, quick to demonstrate are by far the best ones to bring up in that context. Lock picking
327.80s - 332.98s |  is somewhat relevant. If you're a skilled enough lock picker, this is something that you can
333.00s - 339.74s |  bring up. If you see a critical installation behind a poorly done lock, that might be
339.74s - 345.98s |  something you want to do. As with all lock picking, ask permission before you attempt to pick
345.98s - 351.06s |  any locks. Right? With, with that stupid shit before we reach around and hit the thing, it's
351.06s - 356.50s |  like, that's something that any idiot can see and do. As soon as you stick a pick into a
356.52s - 361.46s |  keyway, you now run afoul of possibly the law, depending on your jurisdiction, possibly
361.46s - 366.46s |  ethics, and very likely your employer's code of conduct. So ask permission there. But when
369.64s - 374.34s |  you have permission and if you see a lock that you know, I can pick that, that's very easy. It
374.34s - 379.34s |  should not be protecting all of our inventory. Or all of our PII. Or whatever it is that you
379.34s - 383.94s |  have behind that, that lock door, in that lock cabinet, whatever it is. You can either ask
383.96s - 388.72s |  permission and half the time, you don't even need to demonstrate. You can just tell them, I
388.72s - 396.47s |  know a lot about this. This lock is not well suited for the job. I will call attention to
396.47s - 402.55s |  leashy tools briefly. Who has heard about these before? A good chunk of people in the room.
402.55s - 407.31s |  These are a game changer when it comes to threat modeling. And I suspect that in the next
407.31s - 413.95s |  five or ten years, we're going to see more and more criminals on a lower level using them.
413.95s - 421.03s |  Because they are so damn easy to pick. So next time you're at work or even at home, if your
421.03s - 426.97s |  keyway looks like this, with the little Z shape at the bottom, that Schlage C keyway, if it
426.97s - 432.45s |  says Schlage on top, you're okay. Schlage locks are well made, they have security pins,
432.45s - 436.59s |  they're tight tolerances. They're still very pickable with these leashes, but it takes at
436.59s - 441.69s |  least a little bit of skill. If it says nothing on top, that means it's a Chinese clone of a
441.69s - 447.47s |  Schlage C keyway. Picking is very easy, just raking, but with these leashes it makes it
447.47s - 453.71s |  trivial. No skill required whatsoever. And so that's that's a tool you can look up and if you
453.71s - 460.85s |  use those in your workplace, particularly for higher security, higher criticality doors, at
460.85s - 464.55s |  the very least you want to use a proper Schlage, but ideally switch it out for a higher
464.55s - 469.49s |  security lock that this tool does not exist for. The last thing that leashes are capable of is
469.49s - 473.77s |  these numbers along the back here. Once you pick the lock, you can actually read off the
473.77s - 478.87s |  number and make a key for that lock based on picking it once and the information that tool
478.87s - 484.43s |  pulls out for you. So again, something that if your employer doesn't want someone with 30
484.43s - 488.57s |  seconds of access to the lock to be able to then make a key that works forevermore, it's worth
488.57s - 496.40s |  bringing up. Forcible entry is worth talking about even though in the PhysSec village we
496.40s - 501.54s |  talk about lock bypass a lot and covert entry, how you can get in without damaging stuff, your
501.54s - 506.78s |  threat model in the real world is usually forcible entry. And so that's something that what
506.78s - 511.58s |  that's why I've taglined this, why hackers often get physical security wrong. You need to
511.58s - 518.62s |  think about what's actually going to be done. No door is invulnerable. Any door can be
518.62s - 524.16s |  breached with sufficient force, skill, time, money and motivation. And forcible entry is
524.16s - 529.66s |  usually the way to do that. So this image here is a halogen tool. It is what firefighters
529.66s - 534.00s |  use. There is a full science to this that has been developed over the past 80 years that
534.00s - 539.70s |  firefighters use to get into burning buildings as fast as possible. Criminals are not quite
539.70s - 543.88s |  so fast. They're a little bit louder. They have a different set of tools and techniques that
543.88s - 549.72s |  they use. But any door can be forced with sufficient time. The defense against that is
549.72s - 557.40s |  detection and response. And we're going to drill that into this talk as well. You need to
557.40s - 561.70s |  think about your threat modeling when talking about forcible entry. So if say you you look
561.70s - 565.34s |  this up a bit, you'll you'll learn about thermal lances and various advanced forcible entry
565.34s - 569.72s |  tools. That's usually not within the threat model for most employers and most most
569.72s - 577.22s |  facilities. Um you uh or UFC 402001 has a good taxonomy of that. So if you want a nice
578.20s - 584.72s |  science based way to explain what the forcible entry resistance of a door is going to be
584.72s - 594.78s |  without actually forcing it and damaging it, this is a great reference doc for you. So we'll
594.78s - 599.78s |  switch back into slide mode, see if videos load. And you want to look at the full set of
599.78s - 605.26s |  hardware as well. So this is an Abloy lock. Abloy Protek. It is not going to be picked. The
605.26s - 610.12s |  locking hardware itself has not given in the forced entry. This hollow wooden door has just
610.14s - 615.14s |  splintered like a toothpick. And so even just knocking on a door, pushing it with your palm,
618.02s - 623.96s |  giving it a prod with your knee, you can feel where that door gives. And you can get a feel
623.96s - 629.60s |  for if I were to hit this with a battering ram with my shoulder, give it a good kick, where is
629.60s - 634.46s |  that door going to give? Is it going to give? And that's something that is relevant if you
634.48s - 640.32s |  have items of value or that would be a great problem to your company from a secrecy
640.32s - 645.32s |  perspective for instance, if it got out. So I talked about the um, the science that
648.96s - 657.54s |  firefighters use to lever doors open. What often happens is something like this. So we see
662.44s - 666.48s |  burglar walking along carrying a gym bag full of tools. Gym bags full of tools by the way are
666.50s - 671.50s |  one of their biggest uh, carrying cases of choice. And so we're going to see how he uses this
674.16s - 678.88s |  crowbar to actually lever that door open. So there's lots of places you can get purchase
678.88s - 683.88s |  around the jam here. And we'll take a look at his advanced uh, technique that he uses. Nope,
685.72s - 693.74s |  right through the window. Right, so a big ol' window like that, it's good for people to see
693.78s - 699.22s |  in and to merchandise the store during open hours, but that's just a little door for him at
699.22s - 703.80s |  that point. Right, so again depending on the money you want to spend to harden that door,
703.80s - 708.16s |  detection and response is your ideal situation there. What happens in real life in situations
708.16s - 712.44s |  like this by the way, is he walks the block and he cases it out. And he's going to look for
712.44s - 717.20s |  stores that have a vulnerability like that. And so it's like the old joke about you just have
717.20s - 721.74s |  to outrun your friend, not the bear. You just have to be more secure than your neighbor and
721.74s - 726.18s |  that's going to cause low level attackers like this to go somewhere else. And that applies in a
726.18s - 730.22s |  threat model where you're just protecting money, you're just protecting assets of a relatively
730.22s - 736.22s |  low value. He's going to go in and he knows to be in and out in five minutes. Right, he's
736.22s - 740.70s |  going to grab, the till should be empty but anything of value there, any merchandise of
740.70s - 745.70s |  value, smash, literally a smash and grab in and out in five minutes. So if you see a jam like
745.84s - 750.84s |  this, thin wood veneer, one and a half inch screws holding these metal strike plates in, that's
754.94s - 760.78s |  going to survive one kick and someone's through. So forcible entry is worth considering. To
760.78s - 765.66s |  secure a site you need detectors on the entire perimeter or the interior, delay the intruder
765.66s - 773.09s |  and respond fast enough with greater force to stop someone who has forced their way in. In
773.09s - 778.19s |  just a time we'll skip through a few. There are some alarm bypasses that we talk about in
778.19s - 783.77s |  the village. So if you have detection that's a magnetic contact sensor and that magnet can
783.77s - 789.37s |  be bypassed by holding a surrogate magnet up to it. That's something that is a whole lot
789.37s - 793.87s |  less common to see and is not in many threat models of someone that's just smashing the window
793.87s - 798.11s |  open. But you know what, if they smash that window open and walk through the window, at no
798.11s - 802.85s |  point does the door open, at no point does that contact sensor trip and that person is inside
802.85s - 807.79s |  without tripping the alarm. And so that's why something like an internal areas detector is
807.79s - 814.05s |  worth considering. We also have PIR sensors in the village and a cool little corridor you
814.05s - 819.19s |  can walk back and try to evade those. And so that's something you can practice, get hands on
819.19s - 824.33s |  with it and go back to your workplace and be like, I successfully evaded this at DEFCON,
824.33s - 829.97s |  here's how I did it. And assess whether it's in your threat model for an attacker to actually
829.99s - 839.27s |  try that. So we'll skip through a bunch in the interest of time. This is probably the most
839.27s - 845.95s |  important diagram to understand for most workplaces. This is a standard setup for an
845.95s - 850.95s |  electronic access control door. So you tap your fob, the door opens and you enter. What's
853.45s - 858.33s |  important to consider now is what happens when you exit and what happens when someone forces
858.35s - 863.35s |  in. When you exit, you tap or you don't tap the fob, you just approach the door on the secure
866.49s - 872.67s |  side and this request to exit sensor, it uses passive infrared technology, detects that
872.67s - 877.07s |  someone is exiting, it's gonna tell the alarm controller, someone's on the inside, someone's
877.07s - 882.21s |  exiting, when the door opens and it's detected by this magnetic contact sensor, it says
882.23s - 889.71s |  suppress the alarm, someone's exiting. When someone enters, they tap their badge here and
889.71s - 894.05s |  then it detects door open, someone's entered, normal entry, no problem. If that door gets
894.05s - 899.05s |  forced open, we have contact sensor breached, no exit detected here, no card swipe, that's
901.29s - 906.83s |  when it's gonna send a door forced alarm. What happens with these door forced alarms, 80%
906.83s - 912.61s |  of the time is nothing. They get logged somewhere, sometimes they don't even get logged, there
912.63s - 918.53s |  is no response. And so we're not talking about hacking a functional system, we're talking
918.53s - 923.67s |  about a system that was not functional from the start. Stupid shit. And that's the type of
923.67s - 928.37s |  thing that is really gonna get employer's attentions and is worth bringing up before you
928.37s - 933.77s |  start talking about hacks and bypasses and how you can cause a functional system to not
933.77s - 941.68s |  work as intended. This is one of those things that's worth bringing up as well. Quick show
941.68s - 946.26s |  of hands, who has seen or heard of the canned air attack? Where you trip those requests to
946.26s - 952.74s |  exit sensors. So for those who haven't, it's where you spray canned air upside down under the
952.74s - 957.88s |  door or through the door and it hits this request to exit sensor, it finds a thermal
957.88s - 963.38s |  signature different than ambient, the door thinks someone is then leaving, and half the time
963.38s - 967.52s |  it'll actually unlock the door at the mag strike here, or at the very least it will disable that
967.52s - 972.26s |  door forced alarm and let you force your way through without setting off an alarm. That's
972.26s - 976.90s |  something that's worth trying. And if that succeeds at your workplace, it is worth bringing
976.90s - 981.90s |  that up. Uh going through events in the interest of time we'll we'll skip that. So a quick
984.58s - 991.02s |  checklist to follow. Of just does your access control system function as intended? Does it
991.02s - 995.66s |  allow entry to the correct card? Deny entry to the wrong card? You would be surprised how
995.66s - 1000.66s |  often that is misconfigured. Does it reliably allow egress without false alarming? Often
1002.84s - 1008.44s |  these things are tuned too narrowly or the timing is set up wrong so that it doesn't
1008.44s - 1014.12s |  correctly associate the two events of request to exit trip and contact sensor open. False
1014.12s - 1019.08s |  alarms too much. What do facilities managers do when they get too many false alarms? They
1019.08s - 1024.52s |  just turn off the damn alarm. And now you've got no detection, people can freely bypass
1024.52s - 1030.26s |  forcible entry etc. Prop the door open for five minutes. Does it alarm? There should be
1030.26s - 1035.60s |  door held detection on these things. If there is not, simply propping open the door, coming in
1035.60s - 1040.74s |  open hours, propping it coming back later, let someone in, no detection whatsoever, and the
1040.74s - 1045.40s |  door of course is propped and unlocked. And then simulate a forced entry. Test that that
1045.40s - 1050.24s |  alarm system works, that it goes somewhere that someone actually responds. How do you
1050.24s - 1058.49s |  simulate a forced entry? So we'll pop back to the diagram here. You stand at the door, you
1058.49s - 1063.77s |  wait for this detector to click back off, so it thinks it's been too long since someone's been
1063.77s - 1070.11s |  at the door, and then you carefully open that door without tripping the request to exit
1070.11s - 1076.41s |  sensor. Alternatively, you can do a bypass from the unsecure side, under door tool, poke the
1076.43s - 1082.51s |  latch etc. Simulating a forced entry to- and testing whether that alarm actually gets set
1082.51s - 1089.11s |  off. Cameras are also worth looking at. It is worth simply asking your employer, can I look at
1089.11s - 1093.15s |  the camera feed? Once you've established that you know something about this field, and see if
1093.15s - 1097.89s |  it would actually be useful. If there's some sort of crime or malfeasance here, is this gonna
1097.89s - 1103.49s |  give us any value whatsoever? Absolutely not. It is far too far, far too grainy to see
1103.51s - 1110.05s |  license plates, to see faces, and we've got major washing out of the light contrast here. So
1110.05s - 1114.85s |  lighting and cameras go hand in hand. If you have a camera that's directly illuminated, you can
1114.85s - 1117.85s |  just look at it and see there's, there's a floodlight on this camera, well that's what it's
1117.85s - 1125.67s |  gonna look like here. IR glare, cameras directly create the infrared light for night vision. When
1125.67s - 1131.67s |  you see that with an object too close, it washes out the whole rest of the field of view. In this
1131.69s - 1135.73s |  case it might have been a camera setup that was fine when it was installed, and then this tree
1135.73s - 1140.83s |  grew over the, the subsequent years. So something worth looking at there as well. And then of
1140.83s - 1146.87s |  course just resolution as well. A 360 degree camera gives you absolutely nothing to go off in
1146.87s - 1150.51s |  terms of faces, license plates, the sort of thing that's actually gonna be useful for
1150.51s - 1163.12s |  investigating if something happens down the road. And again, stupid shit. Tampering, blocking,
1163.14s - 1169.10s |  and repositioning. Reach up this camera, point it at the sky. Stuff like this. Think about the
1169.10s - 1176.34s |  third dimension. Someone coming in from the top and, and accessing those. A nice ladder is
1176.34s - 1182.32s |  provided here to get access to that camera up there, and we see all the time cameras that, that
1182.32s - 1187.32s |  get vandalized, repositioned, et cetera, in order to, to bypass that detection there. So quick
1188.00s - 1193.00s |  test your camera coverage that you can do once you've established a bit of, of rapport with
1195.56s - 1201.04s |  your facility's team. Do a walkthrough of your facility, entrances, exits, sensitive areas to
1201.04s - 1205.88s |  be protected, and then check the footage after of that walkthrough. Can you see identifying
1205.88s - 1211.28s |  per- details of the person on tape? Read license plates on vehicles? When is the person not in
1211.28s - 1217.02s |  view? Can you tell what the person is doing? And then try in situations like at night,
1217.02s - 1223.36s |  shutting off power, inclement weather. In all of these cases, do you still have useful
1223.36s - 1232.24s |  information, and if not, that's something that's worth bringing up. And of course, when dealing
1232.24s - 1237.28s |  with any business, and we do this all the time, but particularly your own employer as an
1237.28s - 1241.98s |  internal employee, you need to understand their threat model, what they're protecting, and the
1241.98s - 1246.98s |  risks involved. So if the probability's very low, it takes a lot of skill, effort, et cetera, to
1249.42s - 1255.46s |  do it, and the impact is not catastrophic to the business, the dollar value associated with
1255.46s - 1260.86s |  fixing it that would make it worth it has to be very low. If it's gonna be an expensive fix,
1260.86s - 1265.90s |  that's not worth it to do. And so applying everything over to this risk matrix here helps you
1265.90s - 1270.34s |  prioritize in your mind what is worth bringing up. Cause if you bring up a whole bunch of low
1270.34s - 1276.18s |  criticality items, they're gonna stop taking you seriously. So bring up the most, most
1276.20s - 1281.22s |  critical, the easiest to demonstrate. Again, that stupid shit, that reaching around and
1281.22s - 1286.22s |  hitting the um, the crash bar, that hitting the button on the other side, misconfiguration,
1290.52s - 1295.06s |  systems that don't work correctly in the first place, and then once you've got the system
1295.06s - 1300.56s |  working correctly, then you can start hardening against bypasses where it matches your threat
1300.58s - 1306.22s |  model correctly. So make a note of all findings, bring up the most critical to underscore
1306.22s - 1311.62s |  importance, and get connected with your internal facilities team if there is one. If it's a
1311.62s - 1316.06s |  small employer and there isn't, maybe that's gonna become part of your job. And that's
1316.06s - 1319.66s |  something to think about if you want that to be the case. If you're here at this talk, if you're
1319.66s - 1324.80s |  interested in this, you probably would love that to be the case. Uh, and don't be a pedant about
1324.80s - 1329.78s |  low probability, low impact findings, prioritize things, and again, focus on getting systems
1329.80s - 1335.56s |  working as intended before worrying about the bypasses. So everything I've talked about
1335.56s - 1339.44s |  today and a whole lot more, you can try in the physical security village just across the
1339.44s - 1344.44s |  hall. I'll be beside the stage after this to take any questions, and thank you very much.
