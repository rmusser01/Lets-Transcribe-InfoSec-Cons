0.00s - 5.12s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 All right, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for bearing with us. New venue, new everything. So,
5.84s - 10.16s |  you know, it's just a bunch of delays, delays, false starts, things like that.
10.16s - 14.88s |  But hey, I appreciate you coming out over here. So this is called, as you can see on just the
14.88s - 23.52s |  one screen, Travel Better Expedient Digital Defense. So I am Gray Fox. My background is
23.52s - 29.04s |  retired Air Force. I did basically intelligence for 20 years. A lot of that intelligence, though,
29.60s - 34.56s |  involved some kind of either defensive or offensive cyber. It also involved briefing
34.56s - 38.64s |  a lot of people on how they can operate in environments where foreign intelligence
38.64s - 46.64s |  services were after them. So I created this briefing for them. It is typically long,
46.64s - 50.40s |  but we only have about a half hour with me, so we'll do our best over here.
50.96s - 56.08s |  I do a bunch of digital forensics on the side. I do product security and pen testing,
56.08s - 62.72s |  not so much on the side. I really am into wireless stuff. My big obsessions right now
62.72s - 66.96s |  are setting up Wi-Fi networks and then trying to break them. Wi-Fi is getting better, so I'm
67.52s - 70.48s |  probably getting worse. So I got to keep up with the times on that one.
71.44s - 75.36s |  For my hobbies, I ruck march. I put on heavy weight and I walk around because,
75.36s - 80.48s |  hey, who needs joints, right? You know, but I don't do it on sand. I'm sick of sand. I don't
80.48s - 86.72s |  want to see sand ever again. Welcome to Las Vegas, right? So just to give you an idea of what
86.72s - 92.40s |  we're getting into, just foundations. If you were coming in here expecting something very
92.40s - 97.20s |  comprehensive, I unfortunately can't give that, but what I'm hoping to leave you with is just a
97.20s - 103.68s |  flavor of what you can do to get a little bit deeper into things like wireless anti-tracking,
103.68s - 108.32s |  trying to reduce your attack surface when you're traveling, and some things that you can do to
108.32s - 114.88s |  mitigate whatever dangers or exploitation that could be posed to you if you happen to lose your
114.88s - 120.08s |  device or it gets stolen or you get pulled in by security and they take your devices and they try
120.08s - 125.60s |  to get information about you off of them. These things happen. Ask me how I know. I'm going to
125.60s - 129.28s |  give you some of those tips and some of those tools. What we're really looking for, though,
129.28s - 134.24s |  is a mindset. I'm not trying to sell you anything. It's just about how to think a little bit more
134.24s - 138.72s |  like the adversary when you're out and about, when you're in places where your information may
138.72s - 145.52s |  be exposed. What we're not going to do is cover the entire thing that I like to cover. I typically
145.52s - 151.44s |  do this for military members for 90 minutes. You're getting, I don't know, we'll see, maybe 20-ish
151.44s - 157.04s |  minutes now, so I might go fast. If I do go fast, my contact information is going to be at the end.
157.04s - 161.60s |  Please hit me up. Please hit me up. I will answer your questions. I'll give you all the time that
161.60s - 170.16s |  you deserve. So biggest thing, if you take away nothing else from this talk, is threat modeling.
170.72s - 175.20s |  You have your attack surface. That's everything that you use. It is your phone, your computer,
175.20s - 180.16s |  your social media presence, your wireless presence, anything like that. And then you have
180.88s - 185.60s |  your threat profile. Those are the people that are after you. Those are anybody that can benefit
185.60s - 190.24s |  from getting your information. If I am going to attack your attack surface, it's because I want
190.24s - 194.96s |  something that you have. I am part of your threat profile. It's different for everybody.
194.96s - 200.64s |  A school teacher has a different threat profile than a school student. A computer user at home
200.64s - 205.92s |  has a much different threat profile than someone that's a computer user at an airport. So that's
205.92s - 209.52s |  something that you need to square away with, is what is your attack surface? What does it look
209.52s - 214.96s |  like? What do you use? And then who is after it? This all comes down to the operation security
214.96s - 220.96s |  process. And this is something that we should all be living with. Operation security or OPSEC
220.96s - 227.68s |  is a cycle. You identify what your vulnerabilities are, your attack surface. You identify who's after
227.68s - 234.08s |  it, your threat profile. You look at what would happen if they exploited that vulnerability.
234.08s - 240.56s |  And then you do your risk analysis. Not every vulnerability needs to be patched. Some of them
240.56s - 245.84s |  carry a really low risk. I use a cell phone. Cell phones are full of vulnerabilities. If I stop
245.84s - 252.24s |  using a cell phone, am I safe? Well, maybe, maybe not. But you completely lose the benefit of using
252.24s - 255.92s |  a cell phone. So you're not going to stop using your cell phone, right? You're going to accept
255.92s - 261.28s |  that risk. When you accept that risk, then you need to think about, well, what if the adversary
261.28s - 265.92s |  did exploit me? How could I mitigate some of the worst issues of losing my cell phone or getting
265.92s - 270.80s |  it compromised? And then you put mitigations in place. You put defenses in place. Maybe you
270.80s - 275.60s |  change the way you use it a little bit. That's the OPSEC process. But the important thing is,
275.60s - 280.08s |  it's a mindset. It's something that you constantly do. It's going to become second
280.08s - 284.32s |  nature after a while. Everything that you do, you're going to think about it. What risk does
284.32s - 289.44s |  this pose? How does it increase or decrease my attack surface? How does it change my threat model?
290.16s - 295.20s |  So let's start off. These are things that you can do without traveling. You could be sitting
295.20s - 299.44s |  in your home and you can do these things and it'll still reduce your attack surface.
300.00s - 304.08s |  This audience, I don't have to explain to you what MFA is, password managers. I don't need to go
304.08s - 310.16s |  through that. You all already know what this is. It's been shoved down your throats so many times
310.16s - 316.40s |  over the past decade. Long, complicated passwords. Use a password manager. Multi-factor authentication
316.72s - 322.64s |  is going to stop a lot of these attacks. If you can use a PIN or a password, definitely use it.
323.52s - 327.76s |  If for some reason you happen to be traveling and you lose your phone, you lose your computer,
327.76s - 334.48s |  some applications allow you to have a standalone PIN or password that you use to activate or to
334.48s - 339.28s |  access that app, even if it's still on your device and your device is unlocked. It's a good second
339.28s - 343.76s |  layer of defense. I would definitely recommend that. Backups are a good thing that a lot of
343.76s - 348.24s |  people don't think about. If your devices are lost, stolen, or confiscated and you need to
348.24s - 353.92s |  recover, you can recover. My favorite way to back things up is putting it on a thumb drive,
353.92s - 358.72s |  leaving it somewhere like in my house, somewhere where I can access it, copying a second thumb
358.72s - 364.64s |  drive, maybe leaving it in my car. If I really want overkill, I maybe backup stuff to a third
364.64s - 368.80s |  thumb drive and I leave it at a friend's or a relative's house because what if my car gets
368.80s - 373.68s |  broken into? What if my house burns down? I still have that third backup. You'll probably be thinking
373.68s - 379.12s |  about other things than re-imaging your computer or phone if your house burns down, but it's still
379.12s - 383.28s |  some peace of mind. One less thing you need to worry about. And then the last thing is end-to-end
383.28s - 389.20s |  encrypted chat and calling. This reduces your attack surface a lot. And I would normally spend
389.20s - 393.52s |  three slides talking to people about how to choose one. Are you going to choose WhatsApp? Are you
393.52s - 398.64s |  going to use Signal, Wire, Telegram? What is it going to be? I'm not going to sell you any apps.
398.64s - 403.84s |  I'm not going to give you recommendations. For all I know, Signal protocol gets broken tomorrow.
403.84s - 408.08s |  And I don't want you going home thinking, oh man, Gray Fox told me to use Signal. What a jerk.
408.08s - 412.56s |  So I'm not going to do that. But what I will say is work with your ecosystem. If you're in an
412.56s - 419.12s |  environment where everyone else is using WhatsApp, use WhatsApp because app fatigue is a thing. Don't
419.12s - 423.20s |  try to get everyone to go with what you use. It's an uphill battle and you're probably going to lose
423.20s - 429.28s |  that battle. Really what you want to have in mind is thinking like the adversary. Using your OPSEC.
429.84s - 435.92s |  Every keystroke. There is a potential for every keystroke to be exposed. You could be using the
435.92s - 440.40s |  most secure thing in the entire world, but what if there's malware on your device that gets around
440.40s - 445.76s |  the encryption? So just think about it before you type it, before you say it. Blinky boxes are great,
445.76s - 452.08s |  but the technology is not going to save you. Your brain is going to save you. Social media is another
452.08s - 459.12s |  one. We're getting away from what you carry and now into what your presence looks like. If I'm the
459.12s - 464.16s |  adversary and I want to build an intelligence dossier on you, damn sure I'm going to go to your
464.16s - 469.20s |  LinkedIn, your Facebook, your Instagram, wherever you have a presence, I'm going to find you and I'm
469.20s - 473.28s |  going to put it together. Every photograph that you post, I'm not only going to look at your face,
473.28s - 477.04s |  I'm going to look at who you're standing next to. I'm going to look at what's in the background.
477.04s - 481.92s |  I'm going to look at the date time group and I'm going to put together a pattern of life and a
481.92s - 486.56s |  pattern of movement and a pattern of communication. All of these things I can get from your social
486.56s - 492.16s |  media and the more that I can get as an adversary about how you live and how you travel, the better
492.16s - 497.68s |  I can determine if I were a foreign intelligence, where I can possibly sit next to you and try to
497.68s - 503.84s |  solicit you, get information from you, maybe even try to turn you to my side. It's really nuanced,
503.84s - 508.24s |  really, really nuanced, but definitely go and take a look at what your social media presence
508.24s - 513.12s |  looks like. See if you were investigating yourself, what could you put together? It's
513.12s - 517.12s |  pretty eye-opening. I'm not saying get rid of your Facebook account, you don't have to do that,
517.68s - 523.20s |  but I'm just saying use it a little bit better. This is when you start getting into open source
523.20s - 527.12s |  intelligence. If you really want to see what your internet footprint looks like,
527.12s - 531.28s |  use some of these resources, see what's out there. These are all accessible to me.
532.00s - 537.20s |  I can get you from these. If you can get yourself from these, great. Even if you can't get rid of
537.20s - 541.44s |  that information and deleting your data off the internet is extremely hard. It's really time
541.44s - 548.08s |  consuming. It may be a Sisyphean task because whether you delete it in one place or not,
548.08s - 552.08s |  it'll appear in another place. It's like playing whack-a-mole, but at least you're aware that it's
552.08s - 557.04s |  out there. If you know that it's out there, you can put other mitigations in place. You can maybe
557.04s - 562.32s |  alter some of your routines, maybe stop using an app, maybe think a little bit more about
562.32s - 567.36s |  whether you tag something, giving your location out, stuff like that. It's an extremely useful
567.36s - 573.68s |  exercise to think like the enemy and see what you can find on you. Now let's talk about phones.
573.68s - 580.88s |  I hate phones. I hate them. I hate them because I absolutely need it and it always, always tries
580.88s - 587.20s |  to bite me. Always. You have so many radio genes on a typical phone that there's no way to tamp it
587.20s - 592.40s |  down, but there are some things that you can do to try to mitigate the risk. All of the signals
592.40s - 597.20s |  that your phone is going to put out is collected by the operating system. It's collected by whatever
597.20s - 602.40s |  is providing you internet access. Every single application is trying to access all the way down
602.40s - 608.64s |  to the kernel level, all the inner workings of your device. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, anything. If you're
608.64s - 615.20s |  connected to something, it wants your location. If I'm the adversary, getting your email is fine.
615.20s - 620.72s |  Getting your communications are good. I got some content and photos, great. I might even get some
620.72s - 626.32s |  file access, but if I get your location, if I know where you are, that's my bread and butter
626.96s - 632.16s |  because then I know where I can find you. I know who you're meeting with and I know for how long
632.16s - 638.16s |  and I'm developing that pattern of life. Foreign intelligence, security services, FIS, they're the
638.16s - 644.40s |  ones that are typically after my clients, foreign military members. You can't really do much if you
644.40s - 649.76s |  just track them online. What's the end point? The end point is to try to solicit them in person.
649.76s - 654.40s |  This is a means to an end. I can't do that without location. That's when I start getting into
654.40s - 660.08s |  wireless anti-tracking. If I can try to tamp down how much my phone is giving out my location,
660.08s - 666.48s |  then that's what I'm going to go for. The reason why location is so dangerous is because it is the
666.48s - 672.96s |  business model for your device. The way that advertising works is you use an application for
672.96s - 678.56s |  free. It's got to get paid for somehow and so it follows this cycle. The organization that made
678.56s - 683.60s |  your app is collecting your data. It's selling it to a data broker. Data broker sells that to
683.60s - 688.56s |  advertisers. Advertisers send you advertisements and every click is going to be more money.
688.56s - 693.20s |  It's a cycle, but it's innocuous. They're not the enemy. They're not trying to go after you,
693.20s - 697.60s |  but the problem is when you're making money from advertising, you're not making any money
697.60s - 704.64s |  from security. That's why this is so bad. They're not trying to get after you, but if somebody
704.64s - 709.76s |  breaches those data and all of your collected information is out there, your location is out
709.76s - 714.96s |  there and I as the adversary can buy it or I can steal it or I could just go open source and I
714.96s - 720.88s |  could find it somewhere for free anyway. That's why it's a goldmine for someone like me. That's
720.88s - 724.88s |  why your phones are so dangerous. It's all about the location. It's all about the advertising
724.88s - 731.12s |  system. Can you get around it? Yeah, you can mitigate a lot of this and we'll start getting
731.12s - 737.12s |  into that. Smart cities are becoming more and more prevalent. UTS or ubiquitous technical
737.12s - 742.64s |  surveillance is a reality. If you live in the United States, you're seeing these things pop
742.64s - 747.60s |  up more and more. If you live overseas, it's already what you live in. You have cameras
747.60s - 753.12s |  everywhere with facial recognition as your edge computing, so it doesn't really matter one way or
753.12s - 757.60s |  another if you have a mainframe or something like that that has all your faces in it. These cameras
757.60s - 763.76s |  can automatically use algorithms to detect your face. It's instantaneous. ShotSpotter is a neat
763.76s - 769.92s |  technology that takes audio from surrounding areas and it tries to correlate that audio with gunshots
769.92s - 775.36s |  and then it alerts law enforcement, so you have video and you have sound. You have tag readers,
775.36s - 780.72s |  license plate readers all over the place that'll read where your vehicle is going. You also have
780.72s - 785.76s |  point of sale systems. If any of you use touchless payment with your phone, that's being collected as
785.76s - 792.56s |  well. All of these things ostensibly are being collected anonymously, but in order for them to
792.56s - 797.04s |  work with the vast amount of collection that they need to do, there's not a lot of overhead for
797.04s - 802.08s |  security. So once again, just like the advertising system, you're looking at something that is
802.08s - 807.92s |  breachable. You're looking at anonymous data that can be easily de-anonymized, so ubiquitous technical
807.92s - 812.88s |  surveillance in a smart city is going to be the enemy in this case. It doesn't want to be your
812.88s - 819.28s |  enemy. It wants to do good. It wants to alert a fire department when there's a fire, but as an adversary
819.28s - 825.44s |  you can weaponize these data. So how do you get around it? If you want to take a picture of this
825.44s - 829.12s |  slide, go for it because I'm not going to explain everything. We don't have the time for that,
829.12s - 832.96s |  but there are simple things that you can do to mitigate. The biggest thing you can do is
832.96s - 838.00s |  turning off some of those radio chains on your devices, specifically Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
838.64s - 842.96s |  Wireless sensors are everywhere. If you don't put out a wireless signal, I won't be able to get you.
843.52s - 850.08s |  It's not 100%, but it comes close. Same thing with your web browsers. If you use an ad blocker
850.08s - 854.64s |  or if you put on strict cookie protection, you should be okay. There's recent news that Firefox
854.64s - 859.60s |  was kind of lying and not really blocking your third party cookies. You can go into your custom
859.60s - 865.92s |  settings in Firefox and you can customize blocking cookies. I think that kind of goes around that just
865.92s - 871.28s |  overall strict problem, but I would recommend something like uBlock Origin for the time that
871.28s - 877.92s |  it still works. It's a pretty good add-on that I think does the job of getting rid of a lot of
877.92s - 882.24s |  those cookies, especially the ones that collect location data. When you're looking at payment
882.24s - 888.72s |  systems, cash is still king. If you pay with cash, you're good. There is a camera that sees your face.
888.72s - 893.04s |  There's probably audio that will recognize your voice, but at least what you're paying and what
893.04s - 898.72s |  you're buying might still be a little bit of a secret, at least for now. And then lastly,
898.72s - 903.76s |  if you're looking at your cars, it's difficult. If you want a good car, it's going to be connected.
903.76s - 910.08s |  It'll have many radio chains, but do yourself a favor. Try to refrain from connecting your phone
910.08s - 915.28s |  to your car because the car is not just accessing your music. It's not just accessing apps and stuff
915.28s - 922.00s |  like that for navigation. It's also accessing usernames, contacts, call history, SMS history,
922.56s - 928.16s |  and cars, the security are not great in a car. So if I were to hack into a car, I basically have
928.16s - 933.12s |  what is also on your phone, especially when you're renting a car. Think about that. Think about the
933.12s - 938.40s |  wireless implications of tethering a device. So we can get into that. We can spend an hour. I don't
938.40s - 944.24s |  have an hour. I wish I did. So now let's get into a little bit more physical security stuff.
944.88s - 948.48s |  When you're going through any security checkpoints, I'm talking about airports,
948.48s - 954.56s |  rail, whatever, turn your devices off, completely cold. Even with the best forensics equipment,
954.56s - 959.28s |  something that is turned off, what we call a cold state, would be extremely hard to get into,
959.28s - 965.76s |  especially if it's a modern operating system. Android 13-ish and up, the latest iOS,
966.40s - 971.76s |  they all use file-based encryption, which forensically is a lot harder than full disk
971.76s - 976.56s |  encryption. If you have your device turned off, I as an adversary would have a hard time getting
976.56s - 981.28s |  into that device. If I only have you for 20 minutes in secondary at an airport, that's not
981.28s - 986.24s |  enough time to crack anything. If your device is locked but it's turned on, we call that a warm
986.24s - 991.60s |  state. Depending on the operating system and the version, maybe I can brute force your pin. If you
991.60s - 996.72s |  use a six-digit pin or higher, that would take too long. If you have your phone on and unlocked,
996.72s - 1002.80s |  well then, physical possession is always going to be the king and queen here. So if you don't
1002.80s - 1008.80s |  have it locked, that's on you. I got everything. So do yourself a favor, turn it off. If you have
1008.80s - 1013.52s |  it on your person and not in a bag, that's a bonus. Most places, when they pull you into secondary,
1013.52s - 1017.68s |  they're not going to search your body. They may search your bags. So do yourself a favor.
1018.64s - 1022.40s |  Another thing to keep in mind, and this is a little bit more advanced, if you're worried about
1022.40s - 1027.28s |  your phone or your computer being compromised and you have sensitive stuff in a chat app or over
1027.28s - 1032.24s |  email, uninstall that app before you go through the security checkpoint. Because then there's no
1032.24s - 1036.72s |  evidence that it was there unless they do a full forensic rip. And if that's the case, you probably
1036.72s - 1040.80s |  have bigger problems than what the content was. But that's just something a lot of people don't
1040.80s - 1044.56s |  really take into account. You're not going to lose all your data if you uninstall the app.
1044.56s - 1047.84s |  When you're finished, you get everything back, you reinstall it. You're okay.
1047.84s - 1051.84s |  But just keep those little tidbits in mind. Security checkpoints, they're a minefield.
1051.84s - 1056.88s |  Ask me how I know. I would also avoid doing any dummy devices because eventually,
1056.88s - 1060.40s |  they'll look at your phone that's a dummy phone and be like, oh, there's nothing on here.
1060.40s - 1065.52s |  That's strange. Then they may ask to search some other things. And if they find your real phone,
1065.52s - 1069.36s |  that's going to raise a couple more questions. Don't increase your attack surface. Don't give
1069.36s - 1073.36s |  yourself another bullseye. Avoid the whole dummy phone and dummy computer thing.
1074.56s - 1080.08s |  All right. Inevitably, I get asked about VPNs. This is probably the only really technical
1080.08s - 1087.04s |  conversation I'm going to get into here. A VPN is simple. It is a tunnel that encrypts data.
1087.04s - 1091.76s |  That's all it does. A lot of people use that for privacy. It's not private. It's more for
1091.76s - 1096.64s |  security than anything else. Commercial VPNs, stuff that your company would issue you,
1096.64s - 1101.04s |  it gives you a tunnel where you can work in their network, in their corporate infrastructure.
1101.76s - 1105.52s |  That's what a virtual private network is. You're virtually part of that private network.
1106.16s - 1111.92s |  Off the shelf VPNs like NordVPN, Proton, all those, what they essentially do is give you a
1111.92s - 1117.28s |  tunnel from your end user device to another server somewhere else that has a different IP address.
1118.08s - 1123.60s |  Between your end user device and that server, you have some pretty good encryption. If I were trying
1123.60s - 1128.00s |  to sniff packets in the air, I would just get a bunch of nonsense. But as soon as your traffic
1128.00s - 1133.04s |  leaves this VPN server, it is you. It is ostensibly you. Everything you're doing,
1134.32s - 1139.28s |  all the sites you're going to, any other traffic, it's all out there. It can be de-anonymized,
1139.28s - 1142.40s |  especially if you're logging into things using a username associated with you.
1142.96s - 1147.52s |  The benefit of a VPN is that it changes your location. Your perceived location over the
1147.52s - 1152.88s |  internet changes. That's the good thing about a VPN. If I was in Somalia and I wanted to watch
1152.88s - 1158.88s |  U.S. Netflix, I VPN to a U.S. server. I watch Netflix. But it doesn't mean that somebody in
1158.88s - 1163.44s |  the U.S. that sees my traffic wouldn't be able to attack me. They would just have a false impression
1163.44s - 1168.80s |  of where I am. That's all a VPN does. It's a good security measure. It's good for defense and depth.
1168.80s - 1173.84s |  It is not an end all, be all. It won't protect you from malware, phishing, all the other bad
1173.84s - 1178.64s |  things that are out there. I just want to make that clear because I get a lot of questions about,
1178.64s - 1185.12s |  will a VPN save me? It depends on who you're running away from, but probably not. So other
1185.12s - 1190.80s |  questions about VPNs definitely hit me up offline. So let's cover what we went through in the very,
1190.80s - 1196.64s |  very short time that I had. We have physical security aspects. No location means I can't
1196.64s - 1202.08s |  find you. I think that that's relatively secure. You can't block all location, but you can try.
1202.08s - 1206.72s |  Your online security, if you try to target you on social media, you'll find where your
1206.72s - 1211.60s |  vulnerabilities are and you can mitigate that. Definitely OSINT yourself. For communication
1211.60s - 1219.12s |  security, end-to-end encryption is what we got and it works. If all of you could reverse engineer the
1219.12s - 1224.00s |  apps that you use, we'd be golden, but you can't. There's got to be some level of trust. But I would
1224.00s - 1230.08s |  say if you're doing regular telephony, like your standard phone calls and your standard SMS,
1230.08s - 1235.84s |  a lot less security than using something like WhatsApp, Signal, Wire, Session, anything like
1235.84s - 1243.28s |  that. So consider end-to-end encryption for your communications. All right. Maybe I have time for
1243.28s - 1248.40s |  questions. I think I have, like, what, just a few minutes. If you want to reach out to me,
1248.40s - 1254.24s |  please reach out to me. That QR code, I'm looking at people that are clicking it and I'm trying to
1254.24s - 1257.84s |  make a note of, like, did you really do your threat model with this? But it's okay. You can
1257.84s - 1262.24s |  click it. It's fine. I'm not going to come after you. Those are some books and some websites that
1262.24s - 1266.08s |  I recommend for further learning. But definitely reach out to me if you have any questions,
1266.08s - 1270.08s |  because I am sorry this is very short, but I hope you got something out of it. And thanks very much.
1276.66s - 1281.14s |  And I think I have two minutes. I have two minutes if anyone has anything they want to ask. And
1281.14s - 1285.54s |  please keep in mind, I lost my hearing in the war, so please speak up if you're going to ask anything.
1289.39s - 1306.13s |  I don't see any brave souls. Yes, sir. You may be compelled to get an email from me if you email
1306.13s - 1311.01s |  me because the email address is also in the QR code. And then you'll have to have a conversation
1311.01s - 1315.25s |  with me. And I don't know how that's going to go. That's up to you, but you're a brave soul.
1317.87s - 1322.51s |  All right. Please come find me. I'm probably going to be hanging out in Crypto Privacy Village if you
1322.51s - 1325.95s |  want to have a chat. And once again, thank you very much for sitting through this.
