**Introduction to Email Parsing Exploitation**
- **Email addresses** appear mundane, but **RFCs** governing them are complex
- **Techniques** for crafting RFC-compliant email addresses to bypass defenses
- **Exploitation** leads to **parser discrepancies** and misrouted emails

**Understanding Email Parser Discrepancies**
- **Email address** parsing discrepancies matter due to security implications
- **Ancient protocols** and **exotic encodings** contribute to complexity
- **Tools** and **methodologies** for automating exploitation

**Email Address Components and Validation**
- **Local part** and **quoted local part** explained
- **Special characters** usage in addresses
- **Source routing** and **percent hack** techniques

**Real-World Vulnerabilities and Exploits**
- **GitLab**, **Zendesk**, and **GitHub** vulnerabilities
- **Encoded word** and **Unicode overflow** techniques
- **Punicode attacks** and **cross-site scripting (XSS)**

**Exploitation Methodology**
- **Probe**, **observe**, **encode**, and **exploit**
- **Hacking tools** like Hackverter and Turbo Intruder
- **Fuzzers** for discovering vulnerabilities

**Defense Strategies**
- **Filter** out or disable **encoded word** usage
- **Verify** email addresses even from **SSO providers**
- **Avoid** using email domains as sole **authorization** means

**Conclusion and Key Takeaways**
- **Parser discrepancies** can lead to unexpected email routing
- **Email domains** unsafe for **access control enforcement**
- **CTF** and **resources** available for skill development
