 Hello everyone
2.35s - 9.67s |  Hello. Hi. So thanks for coming along today. We are here to talk about everyone's favorite subject from 25 years ago
11.75s - 15.43s |  So a friend of mine said this to me when I told him what our research was about
16.75s - 24.11s |  And yeah, it holds true. I mean Windows has got some stuff going on. So let's find out exactly how broken it is
24.75s - 27.99s |  So real quickly we're from there
28.99s - 35.39s |  That's a very accurate map we're from the middle of Middle-earth a little place called Wellington in New Zealand and
36.31s - 40.99s |  Yeah, it was a long flight. It was too long. It was too long an economy
41.79s - 45.99s |  Anyway a little bit about me. I've worked at a bunch of logos, which is very exciting
45.99s - 50.83s |  I actually had a life before hacking where I used to tour a lot of bands to New Zealand
50.83s - 55.65s |  So, please don't ask me about the early 2000s because I have PTSD and a lot of debt
56.65s - 63.53s |  I'm also a former software developer. I'm a relatively active security researcher a few CVS in various things
63.53s - 69.05s |  I'm a frequent flyer with search New Zealand, which is the cyber security emergency response team. They love me
69.33s - 71.33s |  Please don't ask me about council software
72.01s - 75.13s |  And I'm Thomas. I have also worked at
75.89s - 81.89s |  Fewer logos than Jim. I'm a little bit younger than Jim. I also do some CTF stuff and
82.69s - 89.89s |  I'm also a senior security consultant. I also do research. I found a fun thing a few years ago in kite works
90.41s - 94.49s |  Also did the Kramer thing with Jim a couple of slides ago
94.49s - 98.17s |  Don't know if you remember and then also the Microsoft stuff in this talk
99.93s - 105.37s |  So this talk is about NTLM NTLM is supposedly going away
106.37s - 107.69s |  Every
107.69s - 111.77s |  NTLM bug we've seen has usually been a gateway bug to something better like
112.53s - 115.73s |  Usually it leads into something. That's quite nice. Sometimes a bounty
116.45s - 120.81s |  It has been a absolute ride with the MSRC. They have a very hard job
120.81s - 124.77s |  We met with them the other day and we did have to change some of our talk because it turns out
124.77s - 131.57s |  They're actually quite nice. Yeah, when you like meet them and they've got faces and names you kind of feel a little bad. Oops
132.57s - 141.49s |  Windows has an overwhelming desire to authenticate to everything that it can it just likes sending hashes out like there's no tomorrow and
142.69s - 145.93s |  The Windows ecosystem is very vast and very fun
146.45s - 151.71s |  So in TLM, we are not going to give it a stupid name
152.79s - 153.87s |  someone
153.87s - 156.19s |  could SQL I squealy and
157.75s - 159.75s |  It still haunts you
160.23s - 163.27s |  It stands for new technology land manager
164.23s - 168.87s |  There's something about calling things new in technology. That means it's going to be around forever
169.79s - 175.63s |  And it's up there with the simple and SNMP and lightweight and elder
176.15s - 182.12s |  So NTLM was developed in the 90s like a few of you here
183.36s - 190.28s |  It's preceded by LM and this is finally completely removed in server 2025. So it hasn't been removed yet
191.28s - 198.32s |  It was intended to provide authentication integrity and confidentiality so far so good. This is you know, what you expect out of NTLM
199.04s - 203.40s |  They've recommended not to use it since 2010. Does anyone know what year we're in now?
204.64s - 210.64s |  There was a 2011 DEF CON talk that I watched called nail the coffin shut NTLM is dead
211.80s - 213.80s |  It failed to die
215.36s - 217.84s |  So and there are a crapload of CDs
218.80s - 220.64s |  associated with this protocol
220.64s - 223.36s |  So essentially at its core it is a hash of a password
224.08s - 227.56s |  Also called an NT hash. It's a challenge response mechanism
227.56s - 232.76s |  So the client establishes a network path and negotiates the server responds with a challenge message
232.76s - 234.76s |  The client responds with an authenticate message
234.76s - 239.68s |  And it does this using the NT hash and there's a couple of different flavors that we're going to be talking about which is mostly
239.68s - 246.22s |  Net in TLM v1 and net in TLM v2. So on a network essentially this lets you browse file shares and websites
246.22s - 248.22s |  So
248.86s - 254.54s |  Some quick definitions before we get stuck into the bugs a hash is data produced from one-way function
254.54s - 258.98s |  So you don't have to pass your plaintext password around. I've been asked to localize my talk
258.98s - 263.34s |  So this is essentially the equivalent of turning a cow into a hot dog. It's
263.98s - 266.06s |  Expensive to get the hot dog back into the cow
267.22s - 270.18s |  So UNC is the universal naming convention
270.38s - 277.62s |  You know, it's slash slash thing HTTP hypertext transfer protocol and you or I the uniform resource handler
278.90s - 282.76s |  So what happens if you steal one? There's kind of three things you can
283.30s - 289.90s |  Brute-force it turn it back into a cletex password talk to the password cracking village about how quickly they can do it these days
290.38s - 293.14s |  You can also relay it and pretend to be that person
293.70s - 297.86s |  That's mainly with ntlm and ntlm v1
298.50s - 304.70s |  Ntlm v2 does it sometimes just for fun and you can also just take a screenshot of it report it to the MSRC
305.30s - 310.21s |  Have a fun conversation with them. Yeah, so
311.69s - 317.85s |  We did a few minutes of googling and these are all the bugs that we found in like three minutes about ntlm
317.85s - 320.73s |  There's also the morphe sector that was yesterday
321.25s - 324.25s |  They went into some more ntlm stuff there, but
325.25s - 330.17s |  It's a doozy. There was the Monica link one this year the windows themes file as well
330.17s - 336.33s |  You could just load a theme and it would send off your hash for fun outlook sound files, which was like a zero-click RCE
336.33s - 340.01s |  there was a bypass for that and then a bypass with that again, I think and
341.81s - 344.81s |  Yeah, some other ones everyone's favorite petite baton
345.41s - 348.29s |  So
348.29s - 354.57s |  Ntlm is just a host of vulnerabilities. A lot of it is just by design. We won't fix it. I mean
355.25s - 356.77s |  It's old
356.77s - 362.05s |  So what they're doing is they're going to deprecate it and then eventually disable it
362.89s - 365.69s |  Which is kind of fixing it, I guess
367.69s - 373.85s |  Given that like half of the environments in little old New Zealand still use ntlm v1
374.25s - 376.25s |  It's gonna take a long time
377.41s - 383.09s |  So we have it on good authority an anonymous source at Microsoft who actually confirmed this for us
383.09s - 387.85s |  And he said to us when we met them the runway for this is between 50 and 100 years
389.65s - 391.41s |  So, yeah
391.41s - 396.87s |  So it's going to be disabled on a future version of Windows 11. This is great
396.87s - 401.87s |  And they have told us that they're stopping working on it. So it's feature complete apparently
402.51s - 407.71s |  So now Windows will attempt to authenticate with Kerberos first, which is really secure and great
408.71s - 415.27s |  but it still falls back to ntlm if a Kerberos negotiation doesn't happen and so it's going to be disabled in a future release and
415.75s - 419.83s |  It can always be re-enabled just like ntlm v1
421.23s - 426.15s |  So one of the tools we've been using is a very very well-known tool. We're not going to go too much into it
426.31s - 429.07s |  This is responder the rogue authentication server
429.83s - 433.63s |  Developed by algandex. Please go and flick them some money for this great tool
434.19s - 436.19s |  the two ports that we
436.75s - 439.55s |  Concerned with port 80 and port 445 and it provides
440.63s - 444.55s |  Authentication challenges on these ports and a lot of others. It does some other cool stuff
444.55s - 449.99s |  It's a very valuable pen testing tool. If you've never heard of it go run it in an internal network and brighten your sock team
450.75s - 453.15s |  For our purposes. We're just going to use it to collect ashes
454.47s - 459.43s |  So this current obsession with ntlm hashes started a couple of years ago
459.43s - 464.99s |  I was testing an ArcGIS application. So for those of you not familiar with ArcGIS
465.59s - 472.03s |  It's mapping software beloved by local government and I asked my workmate Ahmad if he had any tricks
472.03s - 474.91s |  He was a very high-ranked bug crowd guy
474.91s - 481.07s |  So, of course he did he suggested I run responder on one of our servers for a blind ssrf that we had found
482.15s - 484.15s |  And we got a hash on port 80
484.55s - 487.45s |  But actually is is running Java on IIS
488.45s - 496.89s |  So now we wanted to speedrun in case you're wondering what RSS and actually is looks like you can specify an RSS URL for some
497.21s - 498.77s |  obscure reason
498.77s - 504.01s |  So yeah, I'm sorry about the ntlm bugs everyone
504.53s - 510.75s |  So windows does want you to be safe. They do have some built-in protections
510.95s - 513.87s |  One of them is mark of the web, which you might have seen before
514.55s - 516.59s |  If you were to download a file from the internet
516.59s - 521.35s |  it's it's a little flag on the document like a word document or some other things as well and
522.51s - 526.59s |  Basically, it just says nah, I'm not gonna use all of the features
526.59s - 532.27s |  I'm just gonna let you like briefly look at it. You can click the little warning to make it go away, but it's safe
533.67s - 540.67s |  The wordpad issue that I mentioned earlier that just bypassed it. I don't think they even had mark of the web on wordpad files
540.67s - 542.67s |  Oh, no, no
542.67s - 549.39s |  And also if you get clone something and there's a document in it it also just doesn't sit the flag it's great
550.71s - 552.63s |  They also have
552.63s - 555.67s |  This from what Windows NT days
556.87s - 560.55s |  They're called safe zones. This is a recent screenshot Thomas
560.55s - 565.35s |  Yeah, this is from Windows 11 as you can see with the little X's in the top right hand corners
565.35s - 567.35s |  Yeah
567.55s - 573.75s |  You can see that because it says scripting of Java outlets, it's very up-to-date and protects you against many things
574.67s - 579.61s |  The little thing down the bottom with the user authentication it stops some hashes
580.39s - 582.39s |  Over port 445, but that's about it
583.23s - 587.95s |  So it's time to query some hashes from some software before NTLM goes away
588.75s - 591.75s |  So we're going to talk about a few things image magic and graphics magic
592.39s - 596.41s |  Vlc media player espos.net hi Q PDF
596.91s - 601.23s |  The Q stands for quality as we find out Java on is and Windows
601.83s - 609.83s |  calendars new get an eye credential irises feeds and Outlook MS Office URI handlers and Outlook and get full windows
610.71s - 611.99s |  so
611.99s - 618.83s |  Graphics magic is generally regarded as the safe one because it's a relatively fuzzed fork of image magic. So
619.39s - 621.39s |  It's a massive attack surface
621.99s - 626.75s |  Image magic is generally associated with image tragic, which everyone will remember from a few years ago
627.91s - 631.15s |  But graph image magic didn't make a hash over port 445
632.15s - 637.47s |  So it will leak a hash by SVG converting to anything by our UNC path href
637.47s - 643.63s |  And it's noted in the documentation is SSRF, but there is nothing about hashes or UNC paths
646.19s - 648.19s |  Vlc player so
648.55s - 653.57s |  You can just load a playlist file and it's got a UNC path in it and it will go away and fetch the hash
654.43s - 662.03s |  Our workmate Ahmed he disclosed that and then VLC were like it's a Windows problem. No, it's a VLC problem
662.03s - 665.31s |  I mean, it's also a Windows problem, but come on guys
666.27s - 671.55s |  You could also do it in iTunes and Windows Media Player. I'm sorry if you still use those programs
672.07s - 677.59s |  There's probably maybe six of you in the audience that still use Windows Media Player and iTunes for Windows. I'm sorry
678.19s - 682.75s |  There's also lots of other formats and protocols that may or may not support NTLM
682.75s - 686.23s |  I mean, I'd tell you to go and look at them, but VLC don't care
686.83s - 690.49s |  so I suppose dotnet is a
691.13s - 697.05s |  Lovely piece of document processing software anyone who's ever spent any time on the red team or doing any kind of pen testing will know
697.05s - 703.05s |  Just how rich and attack surface document processing is it has a few known documented security issues
704.05s - 710.13s |  SSRF, server-side request forgery, NTLM hash leakage, file inclusion and it's right there on their web application
710.77s - 715.67s |  Security when loading resources page so they know about them and they have front-footed it
717.25s - 722.89s |  So leaking hashes out port 4.5 is relatively abundant and low value within an ecosystem
723.29s - 729.57s |  So port 4.4.5 any good system administrator will block this port on a firewall because there's no reason that it needs to talk to
729.57s - 732.85s |  The internet port 80. However is not as blocked
733.05s - 738.49s |  So when Windows sees a UNC path those little slashes we saw before it only knows how to do one thing
738.49s - 743.57s |  And it takes a little bit of work to get it out by HTTP. So let's try
744.69s - 751.57s |  So I just wanted to look at the district plan for our city and not go to the cybersecurity emergency response team
752.13s - 755.25s |  So there's a piece of software in Aotearoa New Zealand called ISO plan
755.85s - 757.85s |  Developed by a company called ISOVIST
758.17s - 761.09s |  So again, I alluded to not talking to me about council software
761.29s - 766.77s |  It's so niche and weird and the people who develop it know councils and local government
766.81s - 769.29s |  but they might not necessarily know security and
769.97s - 773.57s |  Anyone who's able to spend time as a pen tester so much of it is vibes based
773.57s - 776.13s |  You could tell that this thing had been pen tested before
776.65s - 778.65s |  And you yeah, you could just tell
779.45s - 782.85s |  So headless PDF generation is so dumb
783.25s - 788.53s |  I'm not this is not a talk about headless PDF generation. It's a well-known and well documented attack
789.09s - 794.13s |  Surface within web applications, but sometimes you need to turn HTML into PDFs
794.69s - 795.81s |  Which is you know
795.81s - 797.89s |  There's a few well-known places you can look for bugs
798.09s - 804.33s |  Because basically HTML gives you a lot of primitives to do some fun and dangerous things such as iframes portals and beads
804.57s - 808.49s |  So these had all been blocked there had been some hardening done, which is great
809.49s - 812.33s |  However cat pictures were not blocked
813.57s - 819.81s |  so I managed to get an image tag to give up an NTLM hash on port 80 and
820.97s - 824.41s |  So my first question was what even is this?
826.05s - 828.17s |  So we talked about haiku PDF
829.01s - 837.09s |  Over a million downloads in nougat for this package nougat is the package repo for dotnet. It has a settings dot XML file and
837.81s - 841.81s |  The default property for NTLM authentication is true
842.33s - 848.45s |  so I guess I really just wanted to know how this happened and then I looked into it a bit and
848.85s - 850.85s |  I figured out how it happened
851.45s - 857.21s |  You can tell it's really high quality by the 3d rendered box art. This is the very height of technology
857.69s - 865.73s |  So the other thing we found is because of all the ArcGIS stuff Java on is is a lovely place to look
866.21s - 870.21s |  The HTTP URL connection function used to pass hashes by default
870.57s - 875.69s |  We're not entirely sure it does now and I tried a couple of chess projects to see it seems to be safe
875.85s - 880.09s |  But it is still out there causing issues see geo server and ArcGIS
880.61s - 886.53s |  So Java calls the underlying win32 API, which is a win HTTP request and blazing for sick
886.89s - 893.61s |  Have a very good write-up about coaxing things out on port 80 and they even made a stack overflow post proving it
894.13s - 901.66s |  We had to do a little Lord of the Rings mean, you know, it's compulsory we're from New Zealand we have to
903.32s - 904.36s |  So
904.36s - 909.72s |  They also have one other little security thing on Windows and that's this
910.48s - 916.40s |  Prompt that comes up now and then and it's like please don't quit me. It's unsafe. Do you really want to continue?
916.60s - 922.48s |  Are you sure you want to get hacked and then I'm sure no one clicks. Yes ever, right, right? It's a security drone
922.84s - 925.52s |  I mean, it's fair. That's probably what their lawyers want
925.52s - 931.84s |  Like they want the functionality but their lawyers are like if you don't have this prompt people get angry and we could get sued
932.60s - 937.84s |  So if you want to have a bug in a Microsoft product, you need to get past this
938.44s - 945.64s |  You need to have basically no warning that it's gotta be fun and dangerous and you're gonna get people's ashes or run some code
946.96s - 950.80s |  So with that in mind, let's see what we can find in the Microsoft ecosystem
953.04s - 957.72s |  Enter I credentials, so it's just an interface
959.68s - 962.04s |  But it does some stuff
962.60s - 968.56s |  When we first got some hashes are on 480. We started looking at the code and going what is this?
969.28s - 970.88s |  Why is this?
970.88s - 972.44s |  Turns out it's
972.44s - 975.08s |  Not banana water. It's not gross and
975.64s - 976.80s |  Made up
976.80s - 980.20s |  It's just developers making logic errors doing dumb things
980.40s - 986.28s |  it provides the base authentication interface for retrieving credentials for web client authentication and
987.72s - 989.88s |  it's used in dotnet a lot and
990.72s - 996.24s |  Some of the anti patents that it has are weird and they fall back to some dumb things
996.96s - 998.76s |  like a new gate
998.76s - 1003.04s |  so you've probably seen you get before if you've ever touched C sharp, it's
1003.88s - 1007.04s |  Reasonably integral to the dotnet ecosystem and
1008.28s - 1010.28s |  they have some very
1010.28s - 1016.40s |  Good advice for storing credentials. Just put them in the new get config file. It will encrypt it. It will be fine
1016.96s - 1023.76s |  But it also just falls back to NTLM sometimes. Hello. Yes, I would like 500 of my co-workers hashes, please
1024.28s - 1033.32s |  It does it on new get restore by the way, which it does it when you get clone something and like Visual Studio and
1034.32s - 1038.72s |  That bypasses all safety checks. There's no little don't click me button
1039.32s - 1043.24s |  So Jim got a nice new ebike from Microsoft. It's very zippy
1046.20s - 1049.48s |  Jim had to be very specific with Microsoft
1050.92s - 1055.56s |  Yeah, I had to make him a video with the breakpoint set and I had to be like it happens here
1055.56s - 1059.12s |  This is where it happens happens right here Microsoft. Please believe me
1061.02s - 1062.18s |  so
1062.18s - 1067.06s |  Just we had a random thought like what if we reframe it as an SSR of problem?
1067.06s - 1073.30s |  Like what if instead of trying to get NTLM hashes out? We pretended it was a server and not a client anymore and we just
1074.02s - 1076.38s |  Thought it was just HTTP something
1076.86s - 1078.86s |  There's a lot of harmless HTTP
1078.98s - 1082.62s |  Interactions and Microsoft products like RSS don't know why I'm mentioning that
1083.50s - 1086.54s |  You're writing schemes. Don't know why I'm mentioning that either and
1087.38s - 1089.66s |  Web service in Excel. I'm just mentioning that one
1090.26s - 1096.10s |  If you think of these interactions like a flavor of SSR if you can just find some new cool things
1097.10s - 1100.98s |  Like what if you just suddenly redirect a resource, so
1101.70s - 1105.90s |  we did that we redirected things to a nice little UNC path and
1108.34s - 1113.46s |  It just does things it just happily switches protocols and tries to auth
1114.22s - 1116.22s |  browsers don't do that browsers go like
1116.90s - 1120.94s |  Where are you trying to go? This is a dangerous redirect? Yeah
1121.58s - 1126.30s |  But we wrote some quick little code and then started pointing things at it
1127.98s - 1130.38s |  So this is Microsoft bug number two
1130.90s - 1133.90s |  So we might have rabbit holed a little bit with the URI handlers
1133.90s - 1138.78s |  A quick recap every time you install a program on Windows it installs a URI handler
1138.78s - 1143.86s |  Which is a little scheme that you can embed in a website or something to allow that program to be opened automatically
1143.86s - 1148.50s |  so I dumped every single URI scheme from my Windows machine and
1148.50s - 1152.82s |  I wanted to see which one Outlook would warn on and it was nearly all of them
1153.14s - 1156.66s |  Except for the Microsoft URI schemes, which was very weird
1156.66s - 1160.62s |  and it just straight-up opens words of Microsoft Word or Excel or
1161.22s - 1165.82s |  PowerPoint or access if anyone still uses that and fetches the remote resource
1165.82s - 1170.30s |  So now we have a little bit of an idea what to do when we fetch remote resources
1171.30s - 1176.26s |  So no warnings one click embedded in the email should be a relatively safe thing
1176.26s - 1182.58s |  So they've asked us to not spill the beans. So could anyone just like block their eyes and ears. Yeah
1183.70s - 1186.26s |  There are some security controls in place
1186.26s - 1188.74s |  All files will open in a preview mode, which is good
1188.74s - 1193.38s |  Mark of the web is on it and you can't put UNC paths in the URI scheme
1193.38s - 1196.34s |  So you can't straight-up convince someone to load a file, which is good
1197.22s - 1201.38s |  So the URI handlers essentially look like this MS Word title of the thing you want to open
1201.46s - 1205.38s |  So the URI handlers essentially look like this MS Word title of the thing you want to open
1205.70s - 1212.82s |  OFE open for editing you short for URL and then you just give it an HTTP link and a rush off and fetch that
1213.38s - 1217.74s |  And you can also force a file extension change, which is quite fun
1218.34s - 1221.75s |  And here's a little video of this happening
1223.73s - 1227.17s |  So essentially we are spinning up our little redirector in the top, right?
1227.17s - 1230.29s |  And then we spin up everyone's favorite hacking tool responder
1231.17s - 1234.81s |  And then we just go into our email and click a link I
1235.81s - 1238.13s |  Would click that link. I'll totally click that link
1239.01s - 1241.01s |  And then we link someone's hash
1246.68s - 1248.68s |  Thank you everyone
1248.76s - 1255.76s |  So there are some much better in TLM related bugs than the ones we've been showing half a leaf from checkpoint research
1256.68s - 1258.68s |  discovered a bug called Monica link and
1259.36s - 1263.68s |  So this technique allows for a different and usually blocked file extension to be loaded
1264.72s - 1267.28s |  So a whole new class of bug comes into play in
1268.72s - 1270.96s |  2024 Monica link came up. So we have
1271.60s - 1277.84s |  Two things we have test our TF in an exclamation mark and something. So we have the file moniker and the composite moniker
1278.52s - 1282.08s |  The outlook talk yesterday covered the sort of stuff a little bit as well
1282.76s - 1287.60s |  So the component object model will look up whatever is after the exclamation mark
1288.12s - 1291.00s |  Which we now potentially control through a redirect
1292.12s - 1295.56s |  We have three days left until patch Tuesday. So have fun everyone
1296.28s - 1302.36s |  So we found some more stuff. We were still bored
1303.56s - 1308.20s |  You can also bypass existing CVEs with that same one weird trick
1308.32s - 1314.84s |  So back in 2023 some researchers at Verona's discovered a nice little CVE
1315.12s - 1318.96s |  There's two email headers that this sort of affected
1319.64s - 1327.00s |  there's the content class sharing thing like you're sharing a document or a calendar or an RSS feed maybe and
1327.36s - 1331.32s |  then a X sharing content URL, which in their case they used a
1332.32s - 1333.96s |  UNC path
1333.96s - 1335.96s |  We gave it a little HTTP path
1336.84s - 1343.04s |  Microsoft's fix was to add a nice little warning. They love their warnings, but please don't click me little warning
1344.36s - 1347.40s |  Guess what happens if you just redirect it to a UNC path?
1348.40s - 1352.32s |  At Microsoft triage is it that's what happens
1353.08s - 1358.36s |  And this is essentially what it looks like. It's a Microsoft instruction telling you to click a link with no warnings
1358.88s - 1362.24s |  Seems kind of bad, right? I would add your calendar though
1364.32s - 1371.36s |  And then we dropped it to the MSRC and we had a fun little journey
1372.92s - 1376.80s |  Hi, this is classed as important and you've accepted it for immediate servicing
1376.80s - 1379.08s |  Can you please let me know if this is eligible for a bounty?
1380.28s - 1387.88s |  Now outlooks out of scope. No, it says here in the link. You just said that it is in scope
1389.56s - 1391.56s |  It's a moderate I guess
1392.52s - 1397.84s |  You just told me that it was important in the same email. Yeah, we've reclassified it. Sorry
1399.48s - 1404.16s |  Yeah, so it's fixed last patch Tuesday and it was the only moderate
1405.16s - 1408.94s |  So this is my dog Lupe
1408.94s - 1416.78s |  She recently had cruciate ligament surgery and the amount of the surgery was the same amount that a bug bounty from Microsoft would have been
1417.50s - 1423.90s |  So, you know, thanks Microsoft. Sorry again MSRC team. You're very lovely people. It's so nice
1423.90s - 1427.62s |  Oh, they also said say about the bug before that it's been feature flagged
1427.62s - 1433.74s |  So it's mostly fixed but sort of not. Yeah, I had to say that because I quite like them now
1434.26s - 1441.54s |  So RSS for all six of you still using it in Outlook
1441.66s - 1446.10s |  We discovered something called an OPM L file which allows you to import an RSS feed
1446.10s - 1450.98s |  Which is obviously critical functionality within Outlook and Microsoft
1451.78s - 1459.62s |  So interestingly the web request to be made while the warning box was showing so full marks to Microsoft for almost getting there
1461.10s - 1464.58s |  Outlook would also follow a redirect path to a UNC and like a hash and
1465.10s - 1470.66s |  We triaged it with Microsoft and they initially said yeah, it's moderate. I said cool did that make sense?
1471.34s - 1473.38s |  But now we know about these cool outlook hitters
1474.98s - 1479.46s |  So what happens if we combine URI schemes with these cool new hitters that we have
1480.18s - 1483.82s |  Outlook has a feed handler which will open RSS feed directly in Outlook
1484.94s - 1488.26s |  Obviously four slides back. That's how we know about the URI handlers
1489.02s - 1492.78s |  Under normal circumstances, it will prompt open outlook and give a warning
1493.78s - 1495.78s |  However, if you embed it in a sharing header
1496.38s - 1502.90s |  It won't warn it was initially de-prioritized by Microsoft as several clicks were involved one click
1503.78s - 1505.86s |  It's a bug but moderate
1506.38s - 1511.06s |  And this is what it looks like again Microsoft wording saying please click this thing
1511.10s - 1515.58s |  Would you click that time? I would so click to add your RSS feed. Thanks. I love RSS
1519.62s - 1522.66s |  Enter the visual studio we went back to it again
1523.66s - 1530.90s |  It can get clone things, I don't know if you're familiar with git, but it's kind of like subversion or
1531.78s - 1532.98s |  Maven
1532.98s - 1534.98s |  Now everyone knows good
1535.78s - 1538.50s |  You can get clone from a bunch of things like SSH
1538.50s - 1541.82s |  Which is one of the normal things same with like an auth HDP
1541.82s - 1545.18s |  Which is like a public github repo and you've just copy paste the link
1545.66s - 1549.94s |  Auth HDP like a private github repo and you've copy paste the link
1550.42s - 1556.70s |  You can also get clone from a file path or on Windows you can get clone from an SMB share
1557.02s - 1561.06s |  Apparently, which is weird, but like it's fine. I'm sure people do that
1561.74s - 1564.62s |  But we're just gonna focus on the auth HDP
1565.82s - 1570.30s |  So the command line, it's secure by default. It asks for auth kind of
1571.70s - 1576.14s |  But what if we just you know, don't put in a username or password? Yeah, what if Thomas let's find out
1576.14s - 1582.18s |  Surely, it just doesn't send a username in any now. They won't send anything. So by default it just sends a hash of
1582.70s - 1584.70s |  your current account
1587.18s - 1590.82s |  But like it's fine I can see the use cases for it
1590.82s - 1597.90s |  Like say you're in an internal environment and you've got like some weird web server you get clone from you probably want it most
1599.06s - 1602.92s |  But what it is is it's promising like maybe some other things
1603.78s - 1605.02s |  You know
1605.02s - 1612.42s |  They want to get you username and password and do stuff like GUI's. How do they get your get credentials? They prompt you for them
1613.50s - 1618.34s |  Yeah, yep. No, so get credential manager. It will do things for you
1619.02s - 1621.98s |  It will by default pass a blank username and password
1624.06s - 1626.26s |  Visual Studio users get credential manager
1628.02s - 1629.18s |  So
1629.18s - 1631.94s |  On the right our good old friend responder
1632.50s - 1635.90s |  That's just gonna nicely listen there and then we'll open some
1636.94s - 1640.92s |  Visual Studio and then oh
1641.76s - 1646.24s |  My co-worker sent me this cool link. I'm just gonna go get clone this that's on the internet
1646.24s - 1652.76s |  I blindly clone things all the time. I'm a security professional Thomas. I do too a bit like seriously and
1653.72s - 1656.60s |  Whoa, what's that? That's an NTLM hash that it just sent
1657.96s - 1659.52s |  Yay
1659.52s - 1665.58s |  So some fun side notes it also works in git submodules
1665.58s - 1673.42s |  So you can't just trust GitHub because you could have a nice little link to some attackers thing as a git submodule like
1673.66s - 1679.50s |  Ten folders deep. So do you know what blindly clone submodules by default Thomas? Do you have any idea?
1680.26s - 1682.94s |  Visual Studio you are correct. Oh, wow
1683.54s - 1686.22s |  It also works and things like VC package
1686.22s - 1692.86s |  You can point to a get URL and it will just also download it MPM or so for fun days and
1694.14s - 1698.94s |  Other IDs like chip brains and then like GitHub desktop. They don't do this
1699.78s - 1705.06s |  So we told Microsoft and then they came back with this fun response. We'll just give you a moment to digest this
1705.98s - 1707.98s |  Actually, I'll cut out the like
1708.62s - 1710.30s |  extra words
1710.30s - 1715.18s |  Get cloning from an untrusted source is the same as browsing an untrusted SMB share
1715.78s - 1723.00s |  Oh, is it Microsoft? Yeah, I do that all the time browsing on same. Yeah, so
1723.98s - 1729.16s |  we tried to find where the security boundary was after they came back and we were like
1730.40s - 1736.36s |  Okay, so it's not a Visual Studio problem because they said no, so maybe it's a get credential manager problem
1737.28s - 1740.36s |  But then get credential credential manager uses git
1740.96s - 1748.04s |  But get users look curl which is compiled with the using TLM flags, but it's actually a Visual Studio problem, but
1749.76s - 1756.16s |  We don't know where the problem is it's sort of everywhere but nowhere and no one wants to take blame for it really
1757.68s - 1761.20s |  Microsoft will patch anything that you can prove that it's in their products
1762.80s - 1764.52s |  Anything else
1764.52s - 1766.52s |  That's a Windows problem
1767.40s - 1774.90s |  You can use that on your next red team, I guess if you want to hack some developers
1775.58s - 1780.48s |  so where we ended up was
1782.12s - 1784.90s |  We have four bugs reported to MS
1785.64s - 1790.00s |  Two bounties and one swag. I'm so sorry to my dog from the previous slides
1790.00s - 1792.88s |  Your surgery came later than expected for some mad reason
1793.52s - 1795.52s |  One not a bug which which is git
1796.52s - 1801.92s |  One yes, it's a bug but it's not a priority. I mean, that's fair. It's irises and
1803.08s - 1806.56s |  You know to get to this point. We have a very very rigorous methodology
1806.96s - 1809.60s |  Obviously, I mean I have a spreadsheet
1810.80s - 1812.80s |  It's actually a text file on my desktop
1813.32s - 1821.88s |  So yeah, this is basically how we found all these bugs anywhere you see an HTTP
1821.88s - 1827.68s |  Just put a responder URL and see what Windows does and you'll be delighted with the results image tag
1827.68s - 1831.08s |  Do it sharing tag do it RSS
1832.60s - 1834.40s |  RSS
1834.40s - 1837.87s |  So we do next
1838.55s - 1843.83s |  There are a lot of places. This could be a thing and I mean, it's just HTTP. So like
1845.15s - 1849.67s |  Build servers they can have links out of every blue. Yeah
1850.59s - 1857.63s |  Pipelines, they could have links document processing things like I don't know PDF generators. Yeah, they could do it, too
1858.43s - 1863.99s |  Maybe word has it maybe teams has it. No one uses teams though. So no one uses teams. Yeah
1864.79s - 1867.55s |  Maybe video games. I don't know maybe drop a link in chat
1867.95s - 1872.91s |  Yeah, I reckon video games is what something I want to look at because I like playing video games for research
1872.91s - 1874.91s |  Yeah, I should do that in work time
1875.15s - 1877.15s |  Our boss is here
1878.63s - 1882.03s |  Basically anywhere you could put a URL and it's probably a good place to start
1882.15s - 1887.43s |  But also we want to talk to you folks as well because there's probably a lot of people out there who have some great ideas
1887.63s - 1889.63s |  Of where to look so we would like to give
1890.87s - 1896.27s |  Yeah, and just go turn in tell him off if you can it probably will break everything but turn it off
1896.27s - 1901.87s |  Yeah, turn it off and then turn it back on immediately when someone screams. Yeah use Kerberos because that's more secure
1903.59s - 1907.79s |  Yeah, this is the end of our talk we have speedrun it much like our NTLM bugs
1908.47s - 1912.63s |  But finding bugs doesn't happen in isolation. So a big thank you to everyone named
1913.15s - 1916.91s |  Yeah, and thank you for the MSRC for listening and meeting with us
1916.91s - 1921.27s |  They are genuinely good folks who they need more of them because there's only 30 of them
1921.55s - 1925.71s |  Apparently which is not nearly enough and thanks for inviting us to your party as well. That was fun
1925.71s - 1930.43s |  Yeah, that was good. And thank you for everyone who has published the research. This is something I don't say lightly
1931.31s - 1938.91s |  Every piece of research published leads to more research. So please keep disclosing. Please keep blogging. It's so good reading it
1939.43s - 1940.71s |  And
1940.71s - 1942.71s |  Also, thank you for the DEF CON organizers
1942.79s - 1948.11s |  You guys are awesome and hacking is a team sport and please come up to us afterwards if you have any ideas where to get
1948.11s - 1953.71s |  Hashes out of we want to know we want more moderates that we don't get bounties for perfect
1954.35s - 1964.93s |  There is a microphone there for tall people who can ask questions
1973.79s - 1978.76s |  Cool. All right. Thanks everyone
1980.10s - 1982.10s |  Thank you
