 So this is a talk about Lock Sport competitions.
2.60s - 4.84s |  We're going to talk about how you compete,
4.84s - 6.12s |  what the competitions are like,
6.12s - 8.04s |  how you get good, all those kinds of fun things.
8.04s - 11.72s |  So here's our quick agenda.
11.72s - 13.16s |  A little bit about who I am,
13.16s - 14.64s |  who this guy next to me is.
14.64s - 17.26s |  We'll talk about what Lock Sport actually is,
17.26s - 18.60s |  the different types of competitions,
18.60s - 20.84s |  and where we go to do these things.
20.84s - 23.60s |  So me, I'm Matt Burrow.
23.60s - 26.16s |  I am a Red Team Manager by day.
26.16s - 27.56s |  On the weekends and at night,
27.56s - 30.08s |  I am also a co-organizer for Seattle Lock Sport.
30.08s - 34.31s |  So shout out to all the Seattle people in the front.
34.31s - 36.23s |  If you're in the Seattle area ever,
36.23s - 37.07s |  feel free to come by.
37.07s - 37.99s |  We meet a couple of times a month,
37.99s - 39.67s |  have a lot of fun, teach you how to pick locks.
39.67s - 40.51s |  It's great.
40.51s - 42.19s |  I've also written a couple of books.
42.19s - 44.23s |  The most important one here is Lock Sport,
44.23s - 45.53s |  came out this year.
45.53s - 47.07s |  There I am on the cover.
47.07s - 49.95s |  I have co-author here with me as well for Lock Sport.
49.95s - 53.35s |  If you want to come by the No Starch Press vendor booth
53.35s - 56.47s |  at 2.30 today, we will be signing copies of the book.
56.47s - 58.39s |  And I've competed in Lock Sport competitions
58.39s - 61.47s |  around the world since about 2016.
61.47s - 63.59s |  With me here, I have Jos Valles.
65.23s - 66.07s |  Good day.
67.49s - 68.33s |  I'm Jos Valles.
68.33s - 69.39s |  And like it says on the screen,
69.39s - 72.99s |  I do security stuff as a day job.
72.99s - 76.31s |  I used to be the president for tool.nl.
76.31s - 78.11s |  That's the original tool, by the way.
78.11s - 81.19s |  And well, I wrote a book, but yada, yada, yada.
81.19s - 84.79s |  And I've been into Lock Sport for quite some while now.
85.43s - 90.03s |  In 2006, I was my first dabble in competing.
91.27s - 93.75s |  Three years after that, I decided to start winning.
93.75s - 95.83s |  And yeah, that's basically what happened.
98.31s - 101.18s |  That's it.
101.18s - 102.02s |  Take this one?
102.02s - 103.86s |  Yeah, there you go.
103.86s - 106.14s |  Cool, so what is Lock Sport?
106.14s - 108.54s |  Notice the sport in particular.
108.54s - 109.58s |  Definition of Lock Sport.
109.58s - 111.70s |  It is non-destructive opening of locks
111.70s - 114.54s |  in a manner that the manufacturer never intended.
114.74s - 117.50s |  And we do this as a hobby and as a competition
117.50s - 119.18s |  to see who can do it the fastest.
119.18s - 121.22s |  And notice we didn't say lock picking,
121.22s - 122.24s |  but opening of locks.
122.24s - 123.16s |  That's an important distinction,
123.16s - 124.66s |  and you'll see why in a minute.
125.74s - 127.12s |  So why do we do this, right?
127.12s - 128.34s |  What makes us tick?
128.34s - 131.66s |  Why do we go travel around the world to do these things?
131.66s - 133.14s |  Any of us, I think, who are into Lock Sport
133.14s - 135.62s |  for any amount of time see locks as a fun puzzle.
135.62s - 136.44s |  It's a challenge.
136.44s - 137.82s |  It's something you wanna defeat.
137.82s - 140.78s |  Just like hacking digitally, it's analog hacking, right?
140.78s - 142.46s |  It's a fun thing to do.
142.46s - 143.78s |  We also do it because we wanna improve
143.82s - 145.14s |  on our own skills.
145.14s - 146.72s |  We wanna show that we're the best.
146.72s - 148.46s |  We wanna set a personal best for ourselves.
148.46s - 149.78s |  Maybe we wanna brag to our friends
149.78s - 150.88s |  or maybe mock them a little bit.
150.88s - 154.14s |  So always good to show off to your friends and enemies.
154.14s - 155.62s |  You could maybe get famous from this.
155.62s - 158.18s |  Maybe not super famous, but you've probably all heard
158.18s - 160.90s |  of LPL, very famous Lock Sporter.
160.90s - 162.82s |  There's several people who are well-known
162.82s - 164.70s |  in the Lock Sport community, and even beyond that,
164.70s - 167.16s |  that regular, normal, non-DEF CON people have heard of.
167.16s - 169.04s |  So you could maybe get famous.
169.04s - 170.90s |  And then there are prizes.
170.90s - 171.74s |  What kinds of prizes?
171.74s - 173.36s |  Well, locks often.
173.96s - 174.80s |  You can win trophies.
174.80s - 177.84s |  You can win lock-picking gear, all kinds of fun things.
177.84s - 181.64s |  Here we are winning at various things or at least placing.
181.64s - 185.48s |  So it's fun to get recognized for doing something well.
185.48s - 187.12s |  So yeah, come compete.
187.12s - 188.08s |  You can win things.
189.52s - 192.56s |  All right, brief history of Lock Sport, how it got started.
192.56s - 195.08s |  Locksmiths have been picking locks and opening locks
195.08s - 196.48s |  without keys forever.
196.48s - 198.20s |  That's kind of their job.
198.20s - 199.40s |  Starting in the 60s,
199.40s - 203.02s |  there was the Model Railroad Club at MIT.
203.70s - 204.82s |  They started kind of getting into places,
204.82s - 205.74s |  wanting to pick locks.
205.74s - 208.74s |  So a lot of it kind of spun out from there.
208.74s - 210.74s |  Then in Europe, Lock Sport really started taking off
210.74s - 211.94s |  in the late 90s.
211.94s - 214.18s |  SSDev in Germany was founded by people
214.18s - 216.34s |  from the Chaos Computing Club.
216.34s - 217.66s |  They met with people from Hope.
217.66s - 220.46s |  And so then it kind of came to the U.S.
220.46s - 224.86s |  In the Netherlands, we had the Dutch NVHS,
224.86s - 227.90s |  which was the Dutch Association for Hinges and Lock Sport,
227.90s - 231.22s |  which is also kind of a funny joke if you know Dutch.
231.22s - 233.70s |  That then spun off into becoming TOOL,
233.70s - 236.90s |  the original TOOL, TOOL-NL in 2002.
236.90s - 238.10s |  And then from there,
238.10s - 240.18s |  they had their first LockCon that year,
240.18s - 242.30s |  which is, we'll talk about a very big competition
242.30s - 244.24s |  and gathering of lock picking
244.24s - 246.30s |  and various lock opening things in the Netherlands.
246.30s - 247.34s |  It's awesome.
247.34s - 249.34s |  And then eventually that trickled down into the U.S.
249.34s - 252.42s |  and TOOL-U.S. was started around 2006 at Hope
252.42s - 253.50s |  and then DEF CON that year.
253.50s - 255.66s |  So that's the very brief history of Lock Sport.
255.66s - 260.46s |  So it's been going on now for 20, 30 years as a major sport.
262.10s - 264.70s |  So I mentioned that lock picking is not the only thing.
264.70s - 267.30s |  So there are various kinds of competitions that we have
267.30s - 268.14s |  at all these big events.
268.14s - 269.66s |  So we'll talk about the different kinds of competitions,
269.66s - 270.50s |  what they're like,
270.50s - 271.42s |  and then we'll talk about where you can go
271.42s - 272.54s |  and do these things.
273.76s - 275.90s |  So of course, lock picking is the biggest event
275.90s - 277.74s |  at all these various conferences
277.74s - 278.86s |  because that's what people think of
278.86s - 279.76s |  when they think of Lock Sport.
279.76s - 281.46s |  It is the primary competition,
281.46s - 283.14s |  but certainly not the only one.
283.14s - 284.54s |  If you don't know about lock picking,
284.54s - 285.54s |  walk through that curtain.
285.54s - 287.26s |  You will be taught lock picking in five minutes.
287.26s - 288.10s |  You'll open locks.
288.10s - 289.54s |  It will be fun.
289.54s - 290.62s |  If you know a bit about lock picking,
291.02s - 293.06s |  what is it actually like to compete and do these things?
293.06s - 294.72s |  We all gather at a conference.
294.72s - 296.54s |  There are usually big round tables,
296.54s - 299.46s |  often with like five to 10 people sitting at these tables.
299.46s - 300.66s |  Everyone gets a lock.
300.66s - 302.64s |  You usually get about five minutes per lock
302.64s - 304.14s |  to try to pick that lock.
304.14s - 305.42s |  You record your time if you open it
305.42s - 307.16s |  or did not open if you don't.
307.16s - 309.12s |  After the five minutes, they say switch.
309.12s - 310.50s |  You hand it to the person on your left
310.50s - 311.34s |  or the person on your right.
311.34s - 312.90s |  All the locks move around the table.
312.90s - 314.34s |  You see how quickly you can open
314.34s - 315.86s |  or how many locks you can open.
315.86s - 317.66s |  The person at the table with the most opens
317.66s - 318.94s |  moves on to the final round.
318.94s - 319.78s |  Or if there's a tie,
319.78s - 321.54s |  you pick the person with the best cumulative time.
321.54s - 323.02s |  And then there's a final round table.
323.02s - 325.04s |  Same story, pass the locks around.
325.04s - 326.44s |  Usually harder locks in that round.
326.44s - 328.46s |  And then you get your top three people.
328.46s - 330.98s |  That's most lock picking competitions.
330.98s - 332.62s |  So what does that look like?
332.62s - 334.86s |  Here's me opening a lock at LockCon.
334.86s - 336.74s |  Here's other people opening locks at LockFest,
336.74s - 338.36s |  which is another great event.
338.36s - 340.98s |  So yeah, sit at a table, have a drink,
340.98s - 342.58s |  pick locks, record your time.
342.58s - 344.02s |  Lots of fun.
344.02s - 346.16s |  Then there's impressioning.
346.16s - 347.70s |  We have the world expert in impressioning,
347.70s - 349.62s |  so I'll hand off to him.
350.46s - 351.30s |  Again, hello.
351.30s - 353.90s |  Like Mart said, there are several competitions
353.90s - 355.74s |  that are run around the world.
355.74s - 357.02s |  One of it is impressioning.
357.02s - 358.14s |  What is impressioning?
358.14s - 359.58s |  Well, impressioning is opening locks,
359.58s - 361.70s |  otherwise it wouldn't be part of a locksport.
362.94s - 365.94s |  What impressioning is, is the art of making a key
365.94s - 369.02s |  without knowing what the key exactly look like.
369.02s - 372.28s |  So we're creating a key from scratch.
373.66s - 374.50s |  How do we do that?
374.50s - 378.32s |  We work from a uncut blank key.
378.32s - 382.62s |  So like the keys hanging at your key duplication site.
384.16s - 386.28s |  You take a blank key, you put that in the lock.
386.28s - 387.12s |  It has to fit.
387.12s - 391.48s |  So it has to be the correct type of a brand of key.
391.48s - 394.04s |  And you start wiggling that key.
394.04s - 395.28s |  You put some force on it
395.28s - 400.28s |  and your lock will leave some marks on the keys,
400.32s - 404.28s |  on the key where the depth of the key is not correct yet.
404.28s - 405.64s |  So if you take out that key
405.64s - 407.56s |  and you look at it quite closely
408.28s - 410.44s |  probably with some lights
410.44s - 414.56s |  and some magnifying aids,
414.56s - 417.68s |  then you figure out where the key is not correct yet.
417.68s - 418.64s |  And then you file off
418.64s - 421.44s |  just a little bit of material of that part.
421.44s - 422.52s |  And then you rinse and repeat.
422.52s - 425.58s |  Insert the key again, start wiggling, look at it.
425.58s - 428.04s |  And then, yeah, you keep on doing it.
428.04s - 429.76s |  And in the end, you'll open.
431.04s - 432.36s |  You need a bit of gear for that.
432.36s - 434.48s |  This happens to be part of my gear.
435.08s - 438.96s |  And it works basically the same as Matt said,
438.96s - 441.64s |  how the normal picking works,
441.64s - 444.16s |  except that everybody starts at the same time.
444.16s - 447.36s |  So a competition might be, I don't know,
447.36s - 449.12s |  30 people in one room.
449.12s - 451.40s |  Everybody gets the same lock.
451.40s - 455.24s |  So the lock, same brand, but they're also keyed alike.
455.24s - 458.52s |  We have no idea what the key is, but they're keyed alike.
458.52s - 463.16s |  Because if the cut would be shallow for me
463.16s - 466.40s |  and Matt would be handed a deeper lock,
466.40s - 469.56s |  then he has to put in more work
469.56s - 471.96s |  because you have to recycle through this process
471.96s - 475.48s |  over and over and over again, and also filing more.
475.48s - 477.76s |  So to keep it a level playing field,
477.76s - 480.16s |  everybody has the same lock.
480.16s - 481.68s |  And then it's three, two, one, go,
481.68s - 485.68s |  and people start abusing their locks to get them open.
485.68s - 487.60s |  A competition, a normal competition,
487.60s - 490.16s |  first round takes about an hour.
490.16s - 493.64s |  And the first, maybe six, depending on where you are,
493.64s - 498.64s |  the first six to open progress to the final round,
499.08s - 504.08s |  which means they get six different locks and they open them.
504.32s - 506.72s |  And then you do that in a roundabout way,
506.72s - 508.36s |  same as with the picking.
508.36s - 511.88s |  So all the finalists open, they're all six locks.
511.88s - 514.96s |  And then we figure out who opened the most.
514.96s - 516.28s |  That person will win.
516.28s - 519.36s |  And if that's a tie, then we're looking at times.
519.36s - 524.36s |  And looking at times, of looking at marks,
524.80s - 526.80s |  what are we actually looking for?
526.80s - 531.24s |  Well, so we're filing those keys.
531.24s - 532.80s |  We normally use round files for it,
532.80s - 533.96s |  but that's all technical.
533.96s - 537.00s |  So your key will look weirdish
537.00s - 539.44s |  if you look at the shape of the cuts,
539.44s - 540.72s |  because those are round.
540.72s - 543.08s |  But that's also, for me, that's a good thing,
543.08s - 545.16s |  because that means that the bottom of that cut
545.16s - 549.16s |  will be smooth instead of a sharp valley.
549.84s - 552.64s |  And then you can actually way easier hunt for marks there.
552.64s - 555.76s |  And you can see at the bottom of those two pictures,
555.76s - 558.76s |  you can see quite distinct marks in this case.
558.76s - 560.48s |  They're not always that clear,
560.48s - 563.04s |  but well, for pictures, this is good.
563.04s - 565.16s |  So yeah, it's a hand file.
565.16s - 569.24s |  And like I said, first round is about an hour
569.24s - 571.80s |  and mostly about a half of the field
571.80s - 573.76s |  will open within that a lot of time.
573.76s - 579.21s |  Some people will be a bit faster.
579.25s - 580.49s |  That's a long.
580.49s - 582.45s |  Order of magnitude or so faster, maybe.
584.13s - 585.45s |  Yeah, and then what other kinds of competitions?
585.45s - 586.93s |  So there's also safe manipulation
586.93s - 588.53s |  or safe cracking, if you will.
588.53s - 591.45s |  But here we don't have the entire safe shipping
591.45s - 593.45s |  big metal boxes to competitions
593.45s - 595.33s |  would be painful and expensive.
595.33s - 596.81s |  So we just have the actual safe lock
596.81s - 598.57s |  mounted on a piece of plastic.
598.57s - 601.17s |  The idea here is to figure out how to open the safe dial
601.17s - 604.41s |  in the fastest time, just like everything else.
604.41s - 605.89s |  How you actually open a safe dial,
605.89s - 607.65s |  it's a bit different than lock picking,
607.65s - 609.97s |  than impressioning, a completely different mechanism.
609.97s - 611.65s |  And so the attack is different.
611.65s - 613.65s |  Instead of using a straight feel
613.65s - 615.21s |  like you would with lock picking,
615.21s - 617.53s |  you're actually using sight and feel combined.
617.53s - 619.89s |  And then you're doing a little bit of math homework,
619.89s - 622.09s |  which is always fun in a competition.
622.09s - 623.93s |  You're building very nice graphs
623.93s - 625.53s |  to show how you open the lock.
625.53s - 628.21s |  In competition, there's usually about three locks
628.21s - 629.45s |  that are very commonly used.
629.45s - 633.13s |  I'd say the S&G 6730 is by far the most common.
633.13s - 634.69s |  So if you wanna start practicing this hobby,
634.69s - 636.37s |  go on eBay and buy yourself one of those.
636.37s - 638.33s |  They're usually about $50.
638.33s - 640.73s |  There's also the Legarde 3300.
640.73s - 642.53s |  That one is a little bit trickier,
642.53s - 643.93s |  but if you wanna practice a couple of things,
643.93s - 645.17s |  that's a good one to try.
645.17s - 646.81s |  And then finally, the Big Red is just
646.81s - 648.61s |  kind of the prettiest lock you can buy.
648.61s - 650.17s |  Look, it's got nice red wheels.
651.33s - 652.53s |  So what are we feeling for
652.53s - 654.21s |  when we're actually manipulating this lock?
654.21s - 656.77s |  You're dialing a number, and then you're going back.
656.77s - 658.65s |  And if you know anything about how you open an actual safe,
658.65s - 659.97s |  if you know the combination,
659.97s - 662.17s |  you would dial the wheel, three different numbers,
662.17s - 664.53s |  and then you go back to center, back to zero,
664.77s - 667.45s |  and you rotate it, and this nose will drop in.
668.33s - 669.17s |  That's not us.
669.17s - 670.01s |  I don't think that's me.
670.01s - 672.45s |  And we'll drop in and retract the bolt here.
672.45s - 673.45s |  You can see the nose has dropped
673.45s - 674.93s |  into that brass circle there.
674.93s - 675.97s |  If it's not gonna drop in,
675.97s - 677.65s |  you'll see it rides along that brass circle,
677.65s - 680.21s |  but then it actually collides with it on both sides.
680.21s - 683.65s |  And where it collides is usually somewhere around 95 and five.
683.65s - 687.73s |  And so if you try a number, and then you try 95 and five,
687.73s - 689.21s |  try a different number,
689.21s - 691.41s |  feel where those points are hitting.
691.41s - 694.41s |  The closer you get to the correct code,
695.17s - 696.01s |  the numbers will actually start to converge
696.01s - 699.17s |  because that nose is actually going a little bit lower
699.17s - 700.53s |  into that brass wheel.
700.53s - 702.41s |  And so instead of 95 and five,
702.41s - 705.73s |  eventually you might get 96 and four.
705.73s - 706.57s |  And that's when you know,
706.57s - 707.77s |  okay, I found the correct number
707.77s - 708.93s |  for one of those three digits.
708.93s - 711.53s |  So you graph that, you build this graph out,
711.53s - 712.37s |  you find that point,
712.37s - 713.49s |  and then there's some tests you can do
713.49s - 715.57s |  to figure out if it's the first, second, or third number.
715.57s - 717.05s |  And then you start dialing the second number
717.05s - 719.53s |  or third number until you get it open.
719.53s - 721.13s |  There are some aids you can bring as well,
721.13s - 722.33s |  like this sticker that you see
722.33s - 724.69s |  on top of this safe dial you stuck on here.
724.69s - 726.29s |  This gives you very fine gradients
726.29s - 729.57s |  because it isn't always quite as clear as 95 to 94.
729.57s - 732.45s |  Sometimes it's 95 to 94.5.
732.45s - 734.53s |  And so this extra lines will help you find
734.53s - 735.49s |  that exact number.
735.49s - 736.97s |  So it's a time consuming process,
736.97s - 739.17s |  but some people get very fast at it
739.17s - 742.37s |  and can open locks in, you know, 20 minutes maybe.
742.37s - 745.45s |  In a regular competition with non-professionals
745.45s - 747.21s |  spinning the wheels, it's, you know,
747.21s - 749.13s |  two hours is probably a good time.
749.13s - 751.65s |  Usually these competitions run during a larger event.
752.05s - 753.41s |  So you have all day with the lock
753.41s - 754.25s |  that you're playing with it
754.25s - 755.45s |  while other people are giving talks
755.45s - 757.17s |  or other people competing in other things,
757.17s - 758.01s |  you can keep working on it.
758.01s - 759.93s |  So that's typically how safe manipulation
759.93s - 761.33s |  works at these events.
763.05s - 764.69s |  And then finally, another type of competition
764.69s - 766.61s |  we see a lot of is lever lock picking.
766.61s - 768.73s |  This is particularly common in Europe
768.73s - 770.97s |  where you have the kind of older lever style locks
770.97s - 773.33s |  like you see a lot in England.
773.33s - 774.57s |  Completely different tools,
774.57s - 775.57s |  a little bit different skillset,
775.57s - 777.49s |  but you're still basically just picking a lock.
777.49s - 778.45s |  Same ideas.
778.45s - 780.45s |  These locks are also a little bit bigger,
780.45s - 781.63s |  a little bit heavier.
781.63s - 782.91s |  So we're not passing them around.
782.91s - 784.87s |  It's more kind of like the impressioning thing
784.87s - 786.63s |  where you're sitting at one lock for a while
786.63s - 787.55s |  and you see how fast you get it
787.55s - 789.63s |  while other people try the same lock.
789.63s - 791.91s |  Tools are often provided for you for these
791.91s - 793.67s |  because the tools are very specialized
793.67s - 794.99s |  per the manufacturer of locks.
794.99s - 796.55s |  So most people aren't carrying around
796.55s - 797.83s |  50 different brands of tools
797.83s - 799.23s |  for 50 different kinds of locks.
799.23s - 800.99s |  So whoever's providing the locks for the competition
800.99s - 803.79s |  often also provides the tools, which is a nice perk.
805.63s - 807.67s |  We also have a bunch of crazy events.
807.67s - 810.39s |  And I think there's actually one going on next door
810.39s - 811.95s |  like right now, a dozer drill.
811.95s - 815.35s |  But people of course get creative at different hacker cons.
815.35s - 816.43s |  They want to try new things.
816.43s - 818.71s |  And so you can find all kinds of different events.
818.71s - 819.99s |  Dozer drill is kind of like what you see
819.99s - 821.83s |  a photo of here on the screen.
821.83s - 824.51s |  This is kind of a simulation of a prison escape, right?
824.51s - 825.71s |  You've been locked up.
825.71s - 827.23s |  You need to get yourself out of handcuffs
827.23s - 828.99s |  and then you need to get yourself out of a jail cell
828.99s - 830.55s |  and then you need to get into a file cabinet
830.55s - 831.75s |  to steal your police record.
831.75s - 833.43s |  And then you need to get into a police car
833.43s - 835.35s |  and steal it and drive away.
835.35s - 837.15s |  So there are all kinds of different locks on the table
837.15s - 838.93s |  to simulate that kind of escape.
839.93s - 841.21s |  And then there's also different kinds of things
841.21s - 842.25s |  like forensic challenges.
842.25s - 843.93s |  Can you pick a lock without leaving marks in it?
843.93s - 845.73s |  Or can you identify the marks that were left in it?
845.73s - 847.13s |  Or can you tell what kind of pins
847.13s - 848.89s |  are actually in this lock by feel?
848.89s - 849.73s |  Is that a spool?
849.73s - 850.77s |  Is it serrated?
850.77s - 852.25s |  Those kinds of things.
852.25s - 854.13s |  There's freestyle events, which is like,
854.13s - 855.89s |  go crazy, bring whatever tool you want,
855.89s - 857.13s |  open the lock however you want.
857.13s - 857.97s |  See how it goes.
857.97s - 860.45s |  As long as it's not disruptive.
860.45s - 862.81s |  Yeah, you can't cut the lock in half, but yeah.
864.97s - 868.05s |  And then key duplication based on a photo
868.09s - 869.77s |  rather than having the lock to try,
869.77s - 871.13s |  kind of like impressioning,
871.13s - 875.01s |  different kinds of boxes of locks, time blocks.
875.01s - 877.13s |  You see things like under door tool things as well,
877.13s - 880.17s |  trying to get into buildings, bypassing the lock entirely.
880.17s - 883.09s |  Or pick-tac-toe is something that the Foxconn,
883.09s - 885.37s |  Foxpic people put together to pick locks
885.37s - 886.85s |  and try to get the fastest, you know,
886.85s - 888.37s |  to get three in a row.
888.37s - 890.49s |  So all kinds of really fun, creative things.
890.49s - 891.97s |  We like coming up with different kinds of competitions
891.97s - 893.97s |  to always keep it fresh and interesting.
895.33s - 897.65s |  So that brings us to where do you compete?
898.29s - 899.13s |  We've talked about all different kinds of things.
899.13s - 900.65s |  Okay, so we've gotten you excited about this.
900.65s - 902.37s |  Hopefully you want to come give it a try.
902.37s - 904.05s |  Where can you go to do this other than, you know,
904.05s - 905.81s |  in DEF CON in the Lockpick Village?
906.65s - 908.65s |  Well, probably the biggest and best event
908.65s - 910.09s |  we'll start with first,
910.09s - 911.61s |  and that's you since you've run it before.
911.61s - 912.61s |  Yeah.
912.61s - 913.45s |  Hello.
914.65s - 916.01s |  Like Matt said, you can compete,
916.01s - 917.49s |  well, basically all over the world,
917.49s - 919.81s |  but the one you really want to compete in
919.81s - 921.49s |  and win is LockCon.
921.49s - 923.25s |  So that's considered to be the,
923.25s - 926.49s |  well, the Wimbledon of the Lockpick world.
926.53s - 929.17s |  It's one of the oldest competitions there.
929.17s - 931.25s |  It's, well, in the Netherlands,
931.25s - 933.05s |  they do the Dutch Open.
933.05s - 933.89s |  It's quite small.
933.89s - 934.73s |  It's about a hundred people,
934.73s - 937.73s |  but those tend to be from all around the world.
937.73s - 939.01s |  So it's brilliant.
939.01s - 942.01s |  It's mostly, normally it's in October-ish.
942.01s - 944.25s |  It takes about three days, so a long weekend.
945.25s - 947.17s |  Last couple of times it was in a hotel,
947.17s - 949.81s |  and so it's all catered, all done,
949.81s - 953.49s |  and you'll be spending time with a lot of people
953.49s - 956.05s |  and a lot of locks during that time.
956.65s - 959.61s |  There will always be, well,
959.61s - 962.01s |  just a regular picking games,
962.01s - 964.37s |  impressioning also, definitely.
964.37s - 968.17s |  Most of the time lever locks will do safe manipulation.
968.17s - 970.97s |  Last year we had a car entry.
971.97s - 974.13s |  There's just a lot of, lot of, lot of talks,
974.13s - 975.33s |  and they keep on going on and on.
975.33s - 977.81s |  It's really, really brilliant.
977.81s - 979.17s |  It's fun times to be there.
980.17s - 981.97s |  So yeah, this is the same.
981.97s - 984.97s |  Yeah, this, I mean, competitions, like I said,
984.97s - 988.73s |  table to table, and also a lot of talks.
991.57s - 993.77s |  Yeah, the picture on the right,
993.77s - 997.89s |  that's actually a person that broke out of jail
997.89s - 1001.57s |  in a South African imprisonment.
1001.57s - 1005.37s |  And yeah, he taught himself how to pick locks
1005.37s - 1007.57s |  and to make tools to pick locks.
1007.57s - 1008.41s |  And that was fun,
1008.41s - 1010.13s |  because normally when he gets invited
1010.13s - 1011.41s |  to talk about this stuff,
1012.57s - 1014.81s |  they talk about how it was to be in prison,
1015.65s - 1017.57s |  and this was the first time he could speak to
1017.57s - 1020.45s |  a couple of geeks who were geeking out
1020.45s - 1022.17s |  about how he made lock picks.
1022.17s - 1025.25s |  So that was a very, very fun experience.
1025.25s - 1028.77s |  That's actually one of the very few talks
1028.77s - 1031.21s |  that has been ever recorded at Lock On,
1031.21s - 1034.93s |  because normally it's a non-camera event,
1034.93s - 1036.77s |  at least non-publicity.
1036.77s - 1041.37s |  And you tend to only can get in if you know people.
1041.41s - 1045.77s |  So it's, well, it's not that a lot of what happens there
1045.77s - 1049.01s |  is a secret, but a lot of our toys are quite expensive,
1049.01s - 1051.09s |  and we just leave our toys out at night.
1051.09s - 1054.33s |  And yeah, because it's a friendly group
1054.33s - 1056.33s |  and it's a close-knit, known group,
1056.33s - 1057.33s |  you can actually do that.
1057.33s - 1061.45s |  But it's a very, very, very fun event.
1061.45s - 1062.29s |  Lockfest.
1063.73s - 1065.85s |  And what are we gonna do, lock up our toys?
1065.85s - 1068.09s |  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's locks, right?
1068.09s - 1069.89s |  Yeah, no, and Tim was great.
1069.89s - 1071.65s |  You get some really, really good talks.
1071.65s - 1073.45s |  I enjoy that part of it every year.
1074.33s - 1077.33s |  I think he even had a movie made about him, right?
1077.33s - 1078.97s |  Daniel Radcliffe played him in the movies?
1078.97s - 1079.81s |  Yeah.
1079.81s - 1080.65s |  I think quite well.
1080.65s - 1082.21s |  Yeah, very cool stuff.
1082.21s - 1084.57s |  Cool, so if that's maybe a little too far
1084.57s - 1085.93s |  for your first lock picking competition,
1085.93s - 1087.61s |  you can look a little bit closer to the US
1087.61s - 1088.97s |  if you're from here.
1088.97s - 1090.65s |  We have Lockfest almost every year.
1090.65s - 1092.05s |  Hopefully we'll have it again next year.
1092.05s - 1094.09s |  There was a pause for COVID.
1094.09s - 1095.85s |  It's been in Seattle a number of years.
1095.85s - 1097.13s |  I don't know where the next one will be,
1097.13s - 1098.17s |  but hopefully soon.
1098.17s - 1100.37s |  Go tell tool people you wanna have Lockfest back.
1100.37s - 1101.85s |  Make it happen.
1101.85s - 1103.97s |  It's usually, again, a weekend-long event.
1103.97s - 1106.61s |  There's lock picking, there's safe opening.
1106.61s - 1108.29s |  Here you can see the timed competition
1108.29s - 1110.05s |  that I built with a couple of folks,
1110.05s - 1111.81s |  and people compete on to see how quickly
1111.81s - 1113.53s |  they can get locks open.
1113.53s - 1114.69s |  Again, a lot of good talks.
1114.69s - 1116.37s |  Pretty small conference, again.
1116.37s - 1118.13s |  The lock community is a pretty tight-knit group,
1118.13s - 1121.13s |  so maybe about 60, 80 people will show up for this.
1121.13s - 1122.25s |  Just have a really good time.
1122.25s - 1123.29s |  Have some good talks.
1124.85s - 1126.13s |  If you're a little bit more in the Midwest,
1126.13s - 1128.45s |  there's always Locktoberfest in October.
1128.45s - 1131.05s |  It is held by Tool Chicago.
1131.05s - 1132.09s |  Seems like a really good event.
1132.09s - 1133.69s |  I have not been there, but I always see photos,
1133.69s - 1135.21s |  and it looks super fun.
1135.21s - 1136.69s |  So maybe one day I'll make it out there
1136.69s - 1138.01s |  when I can spare the time.
1138.01s - 1140.29s |  But they have grilling, you can get some beer
1140.29s - 1141.97s |  and some brats, and go pick locks.
1141.97s - 1145.33s |  So proper Locktoberfest.
1145.33s - 1147.33s |  And here's a photo of some people winning some locks
1147.33s - 1148.93s |  and other various picks and cool things
1148.93s - 1151.81s |  from their conference from a couple of years ago.
1152.65s - 1155.09s |  But if you're really into spending your AMLs,
1155.09s - 1156.69s |  head out to Australia.
1158.13s - 1160.49s |  Actually, well, this happened three times now, I think.
1160.49s - 1162.57s |  In Melbourne, there is All Second.
1165.17s - 1167.81s |  It's the same-ish as the other events,
1167.81s - 1168.97s |  but it's Australia,
1168.97s - 1171.21s |  so it has a completely different feel to it.
1172.29s - 1175.01s |  Also, a lot of talks, very interested.
1175.01s - 1176.97s |  Speakers flown in from, well,
1176.97s - 1178.37s |  basically all around the world.
1178.37s - 1180.41s |  But the people there, so the attendants,
1180.41s - 1182.33s |  are mainly Australians.
1182.33s - 1183.77s |  And it's fun, it's brilliant.
1183.77s - 1186.25s |  And of course, for us international lockpickers,
1186.25s - 1189.13s |  if you go there, they have different locks.
1189.13s - 1192.25s |  And those locks are different beasts,
1192.25s - 1194.25s |  and they need to be attacked in different ways.
1194.25s - 1196.21s |  So that's very fun.
1196.21s - 1197.73s |  That's normally in June,
1197.73s - 1201.29s |  and, well, they have workshops locked and everything.
1201.29s - 1205.09s |  So we did have, picking there, a master key,
1205.09s - 1208.01s |  we actually did have an impressioning event at one point.
1208.01s - 1211.45s |  And they're also quite big on tamper evidence.
1211.45s - 1216.45s |  So, yeah, that's a very, very, very fun event.
1217.61s - 1221.17s |  Toby, the head organizer, did take a break
1221.17s - 1223.81s |  because of work and life and all this stuff.
1223.81s - 1227.21s |  It'll probably happen again,
1227.21s - 1228.97s |  but probably not this year.
1228.97s - 1230.49s |  Well, definitely not this year.
1230.49s - 1232.29s |  Probably not next year,
1232.29s - 1233.73s |  but it's still in the books.
1233.73s - 1235.33s |  At some point, that will happen.
1235.33s - 1240.33s |  You see, well, a box of weird keys that they do have there.
1240.89s - 1245.89s |  And some keys are giving a lecture about impressioning.
1246.09s - 1249.85s |  Yeah, and then in Europe, well, like I said,
1249.85s - 1253.37s |  there's Lock-On in the Netherlands.
1253.37s - 1255.85s |  The Germans do, every now and then,
1255.85s - 1259.85s |  also have a lock-on in the Netherlands.
1259.85s - 1264.85s |  And also have, and impressioning competitions.
1265.21s - 1267.97s |  And on a separate day, they'll do the lock-picking.
1267.97s - 1272.97s |  And the Czech guys at the moment are also doing that.
1275.09s - 1279.73s |  Smaller-ish group, so 90 people, it's rather close to Prague.
1279.73s - 1282.77s |  And that, well, they do that for quite a couple of years now.
1282.77s - 1285.41s |  And as you can see, they have a couple of sponsors,
1285.41s - 1286.69s |  which is not always the case
1286.69s - 1289.57s |  within the lock-picking community, at least for an event.
1290.37s - 1292.45s |  The prizes get sponsored and stuff like that,
1292.45s - 1295.01s |  but that's about it-ish.
1295.01s - 1295.85s |  Is this yours?
1297.61s - 1298.45s |  And where else?
1298.45s - 1299.97s |  There's always a few smaller conferences
1299.97s - 1301.01s |  or conferences that are bigger,
1301.01s - 1303.49s |  but where there's a smaller lock-picking portion to it.
1303.49s - 1305.65s |  Of course, Defcon, right through there.
1306.85s - 1308.97s |  It's pretty big here, yeah.
1308.97s - 1310.61s |  There's Hope in New York.
1310.61s - 1313.81s |  There's ShmooCon in DC, at least one more year.
1313.81s - 1317.01s |  CCC, EMF, all the various Dutch hacker cons
1317.01s - 1319.33s |  that change their name annoyingly every year.
1320.09s - 1323.49s |  All the various B-sides often have lock-picking events
1323.49s - 1325.33s |  that you can go participate in.
1325.33s - 1327.93s |  And then Hacker Hotel, again, in the Netherlands.
1329.57s - 1331.93s |  Other than that, there's also locksmithing
1331.93s - 1333.41s |  and safe technician conferences.
1333.41s - 1335.05s |  These tend to be a little bit more invite-only.
1335.05s - 1337.89s |  You probably need to be part of a locksmithing association.
1337.89s - 1339.93s |  Some of those are easier or harder to join,
1339.93s - 1342.05s |  but you can go and do safe cracking
1342.05s - 1345.01s |  and hear a lot of talks about that, if that's your thing.
1345.01s - 1347.41s |  And they have cool prizes like gold-plated locks
1347.45s - 1349.57s |  when you win sponsors.
1349.57s - 1351.45s |  So that is it.
1351.45s - 1353.19s |  That is all the different kinds of competitions.
1353.19s - 1354.69s |  Those are the different ways you can compete.
1354.69s - 1356.95s |  We wanted to thank a few people.
1356.95s - 1360.33s |  Our co-authors, there were five of us that wrote the book.
1360.33s - 1361.33s |  Three of us are not here,
1361.33s - 1363.69s |  so Walter, Nigel, and Banditos.
1363.69s - 1366.49s |  Really appreciate the sections of the book that they wrote.
1366.49s - 1367.33s |  It was great.
1367.33s - 1368.85s |  I wanna thank specifically Peter South,
1368.85s - 1370.05s |  who was our technical reviewer
1370.05s - 1371.25s |  and who's also here in the front row
1371.25s - 1373.45s |  and has helped out with Tool and Seattle Locksport
1373.45s - 1375.97s |  and co-run Seattle Locksport with me.
1375.97s - 1377.37s |  Super great guy.
1378.13s - 1378.97s |  Lucky Duck, thanks for being here.
1378.97s - 1380.81s |  You're awesome and my favorite.
1380.81s - 1382.73s |  Thanks to Random Person from the internet
1382.73s - 1386.29s |  for the background photo that was Creative Commons.
1386.29s - 1388.13s |  And then also thanks to Tool US
1388.13s - 1389.85s |  for letting us come here and speak
1389.85s - 1392.13s |  and to DEF CON for letting us speak.
1392.13s - 1393.65s |  Finally, if you want to get in touch,
1393.65s - 1395.21s |  here are all the things.
1395.21s - 1397.97s |  You can go to links and find me or us.
1397.97s - 1401.37s |  But more importantly, we will be here at the book signing
1401.37s - 1403.31s |  at the No Starch booth at 2.30 today.
1403.31s - 1404.93s |  So if you do not have a copy of our book
1404.93s - 1405.77s |  and you would like one
1405.77s - 1407.93s |  and you wanted to have at least two author signatures
1407.93s - 1409.49s |  and a tech reviewer signature,
1409.49s - 1413.37s |  2.30 just there, vendor area east.
1413.37s - 1414.85s |  We will be sitting there and signing things.
1414.85s - 1416.93s |  So come say hi, come get books signed.
1416.93s - 1417.77s |  Thank you so much.
1417.77s - 1418.61s |  One more thing, one more thing.
1418.61s - 1419.45s |  Yes, yes.
1419.45s - 1421.29s |  One more thing, hot from the press.
1421.29s - 1426.29s |  As of last week, this book also exists in a Braille format.
1429.11s - 1429.95s |  Cool.
1429.95s - 1431.19s |  Yeah, very cool.
1431.19s - 1433.51s |  That is currently only in Europe
1433.51s - 1436.87s |  because it has been transcribed there to make that happen.
1437.43s - 1438.27s |  But as I understood,
1438.27s - 1441.79s |  I am completely new to this format and this world.
1441.79s - 1443.47s |  I do have a couple of blind friends,
1443.47s - 1445.39s |  but of course I don't do Braille.
1445.39s - 1447.11s |  And apparently the way it works,
1447.11s - 1451.33s |  if it does exist in Europe,
1451.33s - 1454.15s |  then it automatically will at some point
1454.15s - 1459.15s |  will become available in American Braille libraries as well.
1459.55s - 1462.09s |  So we think it's awesome.
1463.43s - 1464.27s |  Very cool.
1464.27s - 1466.19s |  Thank you, DEF CON.
