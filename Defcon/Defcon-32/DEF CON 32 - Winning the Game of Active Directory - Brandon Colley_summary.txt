**Overview of the Talk**
- **Title:** Winning the Game of Active Directory
- **Speaker:** Brandon Colley
- **Event:** DEF CON 32
- **Focus:** Strategies for attacking and defending Active Directory (AD) environments

**Introduction**
- **GOAD (Game Of Active Directory):** A prebuilt, vulnerable AD environment for pentesters
- **Purpose:** To explore AD attack strategies and mitigation techniques

**Character Selection in AD Security**
- **Penetration Testers:** Exploit vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
- **Red Teamers:** Test detections, perform stealthy activities
- **Defenders:** Harden environments, monitor, improve security posture
- **Adversaries:** Do not play by the rules

**Winning in AD Security**
- **Goal:** Maintain and continuously improve secure environments
- **Method:** Implement safeguards and ensure continuous progress

**Level 1: Reconnaissance, Enumeration, Privilege Escalation (PrivEsc)**
- **Reconnaissance:** Using network access to gather information
- **Anonymous Access:** Misconfiguration allows querying user lists without credentials
  - **Mitigation:** Remove anonymous logon from domain root
- **User Enumeration:** Use Kerberos protocol to verify valid accounts
  - **Mitigation:** Change naming convention, use multiple trailing digits
- **Kerberos Pre-authentication Attacks:**
  - **Attack Style:** AS-REP Roasting
  - **Mitigation:** Enable Kerberos pre-authentication

**Level 2: More Hacks (Authenticated Attacks)**
- **Kerberoasting Attack:**
  - **Target:** Accounts with Service Principal Names (SPNs)
  - **Mitigation:** Use strong, random passwords for service accounts
- **On Path Attacks:**
  - **Tool:** Responder for NTLM hashes
  - **Mitigation:** Disable LLMNR, enforce NTLMv2, LDAP signing, and channel binding
- **Protected Users Group:** Secure high-privilege accounts
  - **Mitigation:** Use Jake Hildrethâ€™s tool for managing protected users

**Level 3: Privilege Escalation (PrivEsc) and Lateral Movement**
- **ACL Modification:**
  - **Attack:** Modify GPO permissions
  - **Mitigation:** Review and secure GPO delegations and ownership
- **Pass the Hash Attack:**
  - **Tool:** EvilWinRM for domain controller access
  - **Mitigation:** Implement LAPS for local administrator accounts
- **Kerberos Delegation:**
  - **Attack Style:** Unconstrained Delegation
  - **Mitigation:** Use constrained delegation, mark accounts as "sensitive and cannot be delegated"

**Level 4: Pwning Active Directory**
- **Print Nightmare:** Exploit using print spooler
  - **Mitigation:** Disable print spooler if not needed
- **Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS):**
  - **Vulnerability:** ESC1
  - **Mitigation:** Restrict certificate enrollment, require manager approval

**Conclusion**
- **Continuous Improvement:** Always new vulnerabilities in AD
- **Recommendations:** Regular assessments, pen tests, and using available tools for security enhancement
