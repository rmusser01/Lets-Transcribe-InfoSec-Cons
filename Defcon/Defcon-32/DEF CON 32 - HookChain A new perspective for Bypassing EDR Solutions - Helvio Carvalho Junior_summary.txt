**DEF CON 32 Presentation Overview**

- **Presenter Introduction**:
  - Presenter: **Elvio Junior**, aka Maverick
  - Background: **Pilot** and cybersecurity researcher
  - Company: **SecForUs**, a Brazilian cybersecurity company

- **Presentation Structure**:
  - Introduction to **HookChain** concept
  - Discussion on **EDR/XDR bypassing**
  - Explanation of **HookChain** technique
  - Presentation of technical details and **demo**

**HookChain Technique**

- **Concept**:
  - **HookChain** is a technique, not a tool
  - Focused on bypassing **EDR** and **XDR** monitoring within **NTDLL**
  - Operates entirely in **user land**

- **Motivation**:
  - Challenges the belief that there is a **"silver bullet"** for cybersecurity
  - Aims to bypass specific environments rather than all

- **Technical Details**:
  - Utilizes **IAT Hooking**, dynamic **SSN resolution**, and **indirect system calls**
  - Redirects execution flow in a way that is invisible to EDRs focusing on **Ntdll.dll**

**EDR Bypassing Techniques**

- **Hooking**:
  - Commonly used by both attackers and EDR vendors
  - Involves intercepting and redirecting function calls

- **Bypass Strategies**:
  - **Remapping NTDLL**
  - **Direct syscall** execution
  - **Indirect syscall** using **NTDLL**

**HookChain Implementation**

- **Steps**:
  - Dynamically resolve **system service numbers**
  - Create a table mapping service numbers to custom stub functions
  - Change the **import address table** to redirect calls to custom functions

- **Advantages**:
  - **Reduction in detection probability**
  - Similar execution time to regular processes
  - No need to alter original application code

**Demonstration and Results**

- **Demo Summary**:
  - Demonstrated bypassing EDR systems with **HookChain**
  - Execution of **malicious payloads** without detection

- **Testing Environment**:
  - Conducted tests in a protected environment
  - Collaboration with the **Brazilian community** for resources

- **Results**:
  - Tested 66% of products listed in **Gartner**
  - **SentinelOne** managed to patch their product to stop **HookChain**
  - Ongoing work with other vendors

**Conclusion**

- **Reflection**:
  - Importance of continuous evolution in cybersecurity
  - Inspiration from techniques like **Heaven Gate**, **Hell's Gate**, and **Hallows Gate**
