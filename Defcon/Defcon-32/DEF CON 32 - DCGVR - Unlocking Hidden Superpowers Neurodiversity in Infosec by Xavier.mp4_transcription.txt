 Okay, Xavier Ashe of Rubik's 1138, he hails from DC44 here in Atlanta, Georgia.
15.03s - 20.49s |  Xavier is presenting Unlocking Hidden Superpowers, Neurodiversity in InfoSec.
21.49s - 24.85s |  Are you ready to embark on a journey that celebrates uniqueness,
24.85s - 26.85s |  innovation, and untapped potential?
26.85s - 33.45s |  It's time to shine a light on neurodiversity and what that means to information security.
34.05s - 40.53s |  The power of neurodiversity, imagine a world where different brains aren't seen as deficits,
40.53s - 46.37s |  but as diverse strengths. Neurodiversity embraces the beautiful mosaic of human minds
46.37s - 50.29s |  from ADD or ADHD to autism and beyond.
52.53s - 57.09s |  To autism and beyond, Xavier will unravel the superpowers hidden within the neurodivergent
57.09s - 61.17s |  individuals like visual hypersensitivity, out-of-the-box thinking,
61.25s - 64.13s |  and encyclopedic knowledge.
65.17s - 68.61s |  These aren't just buzzwords, they're game changers for the InfoSec field.
69.33s - 72.21s |  Brace yourself for success stories that defy convention.
75.33s - 82.05s |  JPMorgan Chase's neurodiverse hires outperform their peers by leaps and bounds.
82.05s - 86.85s |  Productivity spikes, retention soars, and innovation thrives.
86.85s - 94.53s |  Ultratesting, an IT company with 75% neurodiverse staff, proves that inclusion isn't charity,
95.25s - 98.13s |  it's smart. It's smart business, sorry.
98.13s - 103.73s |  Their mantra, staffing fantastically capable talent who just haven't had a fair shot before.
104.85s - 107.01s |  Xavier won't stop at inspiration.
107.01s - 112.45s |  He'll equip you with actionable steps, including how to revisit hiring processes,
112.45s - 115.57s |  adapting the environment, tailored career journeys.
116.53s - 118.05s |  Be part of the movement.
118.05s - 122.21s |  Whether you are a hacker, an individual seeking help, or just a cat lover, yes,
122.77s - 124.29s |  there's a slide for that.
124.29s - 127.49s |  This presentation is your invitation to change the narrative.
127.49s - 130.13s |  So mark your calendars, grab your virtual seat,
130.13s - 133.41s |  and let's celebrate neurodiversity one mind at a time.
133.41s - 136.85s |  Remember, the rising tide lifts all boats.
136.85s - 141.17s |  Join us, learn, and be part of the more inclusive future.
141.17s - 143.89s |  Don't miss out on this.
145.57s - 147.49s |  Sorry, I can't read this.
147.49s - 148.61s |  Don't miss out.
148.61s - 150.77s |  This isn't your typical tech talk.
150.77s - 153.17s |  It's a revolution waiting to happen.
153.17s - 153.81s |  See you there.
154.45s - 156.45s |  Now let's, here's his bio.
157.01s - 160.69s |  Xavier Ashe is currently a senior vice president in Truist
160.69s - 166.69s |  Cyber Operations and Technology Divisions, where he has awarded the Truist Performance Award.
166.69s - 170.53s |  He is chairman of the board of the Technology Association of Georgia,
170.53s - 172.61s |  Information Security Society.
172.61s - 175.57s |  Xavier is a Georgia Institute of Technology alumnus,
175.57s - 179.57s |  and has over 30 years of leadership experience in information security,
179.57s - 185.73s |  working for various vendors and consulting firms, including IBM, Gartner, and Carbon Black.
185.73s - 191.49s |  Xavier was the first hire at startup robbery networks, where he was instrumental in bringing
191.49s - 197.65s |  the first micro-segmentation solution to servers, and micro-and workstations to the market.
197.65s - 202.45s |  Mr. Ashe has many more stories, including the first DDoS hack ever.
202.45s - 204.69s |  Target, Sony, Aramco.
204.69s - 206.13s |  Oh, wow, that's interesting.
206.13s - 207.89s |  And one, I believe, will be docked.
207.89s - 209.57s |  We hope to talk about that.
209.57s - 210.53s |  And others.
210.53s - 214.93s |  Xavier is an accomplished speaker, and has presented at many security conferences,
214.93s - 220.69s |  including DEF CON, Black Hat, RSA, D-side, Splunk, SANS, and others.
220.69s - 222.69s |  And as well as C-4, of course.
222.69s - 226.93s |  I'd like to welcome to the stage Xavier Ashe, otherwise known as Rubik's 11,
226.93s - 227.73s |  138.
227.73s - 229.33s |  Is he here?
229.33s - 230.61s |  I hope he's here.
230.61s - 231.65s |  Here he is.
231.65s - 232.77s |  Take it away, Rubik's.
246.24s - 247.04s |  Welcome, everyone.
247.04s - 248.64s |  Thank you so much for joining.
248.64s - 254.08s |  I realize one thing that is definitely not my superpower is going to be the ability to do
254.96s - 256.80s |  UTC math in my head.
257.68s - 262.24s |  I really got the times wrong about three or four times today.
262.24s - 264.32s |  So I'll have to work on that.
264.32s - 265.44s |  But I'm here.
265.44s - 266.16s |  I'm ready to go.
266.16s - 267.44s |  And we are going to dive into this.
267.44s - 270.40s |  I'm really excited to be part of this experience.
270.40s - 271.28s |  It's really neat.
272.16s - 274.64s |  And I'm glad to be part of this.
274.64s - 276.16s |  So let's keep going here.
277.84s - 278.88s |  There we go.
278.88s - 280.64s |  So who am I?
280.64s - 282.00s |  My name is Xavier Ashe.
282.00s - 285.76s |  I have been hacking since the late 80s.
285.76s - 289.68s |  I got into VBSing and then into the internet.
289.68s - 295.60s |  And eventually got a real job and was able to get into information security in the 90s.
295.60s - 298.24s |  And I go by Rubik's 1-1-3-8.
298.24s - 299.68s |  A quick story on that one.
299.68s - 303.76s |  I was first Rubik's cube with a little up caret 3.
304.64s - 311.76s |  Once the hackers started getting crazy with hacking into usernames and passwords, a lot of
312.48s - 314.80s |  systems stopped using the up caret.
314.80s - 322.56s |  So I wasn't able to get Rubik's up caret 3 to get through on my own with Rubik's 1-1-3-8.
323.52s - 326.32s |  And I do have a big family, a father of eight.
326.32s - 332.72s |  And I am very sorry if I do throw out some sarcastic tones here.
332.72s - 334.56s |  That's what I was raised with.
334.56s - 336.16s |  So moving on.
338.08s - 338.88s |  Neurodiversity.
338.88s - 344.32s |  So what we're going to do is we're going to start by kind of explaining what neurodiversity,
344.32s - 349.52s |  what I mean by these terms so that we are all on the same page moving forward.
349.52s - 350.96s |  I think this is pretty useful.
351.60s - 358.56s |  When I put this together, it really helped me solidify when to use these different terms.
358.56s - 359.92s |  So let's dive in.
359.92s - 360.16s |  Right?
360.16s - 364.64s |  So neurodiversity is both a concept and really a movement.
364.64s - 369.68s |  So if you think about neurodiversity as a concept, it really is about the fact that we
370.80s - 376.08s |  it's the realization that all of our brains operate differently.
376.64s - 380.08s |  And that is a spectrum.
380.08s - 384.72s |  It is a diversity of how our brains work.
384.72s - 389.92s |  And it's not necessarily a disease or a defect.
389.92s - 392.88s |  It's just a different way that our brains work.
392.88s - 398.56s |  And so the movement behind that by that concept and really realizing it, it's more about,
399.44s - 408.08s |  you know, unleashing the strengths of these neurodivergent people so that we can understand
408.08s - 413.28s |  and get them integrated into society and find a place that really makes them happy.
413.28s - 417.92s |  And so that's where my passion's at is to really kind of, you know,
417.92s - 424.77s |  help make the world a little bit easier for the neurodivergent folks.
424.77s - 426.85s |  So what is neurodiversity?
427.81s - 434.93s |  The neurodiversity is really a collection of terms that means a whole bunch of different stuff.
435.89s - 438.13s |  And so some of these, let's address some of them.
438.13s - 442.77s |  One of the biggest ones that you'll hear about is ADHD.
442.77s - 451.65s |  It's the largest population of neurodivergent folks is, you know, around 10% of children.
452.85s - 456.85s |  And right now it's measured at about 4.4% of adults.
457.49s - 462.61s |  And it's a, you know, probably a whole lot of people can identify with that.
462.61s - 467.65s |  It is something where, you know, technology is a great place for ADHD
467.65s - 471.33s |  folks to be able to find the way to be productive.
472.61s - 477.17s |  Autism spectrum disorder is right now at 2.8%.
478.21s - 483.25s |  And is, you know, that's one in 36.
484.69s - 490.85s |  And it's a pretty interesting development as we move forward and learning a lot more about
491.73s - 494.61s |  autism and autistic people.
494.61s - 500.53s |  It's great to see us figure out a better way of integrating them into society.
501.41s - 505.89s |  Other neurodiversity, you know, that you might have heard of is Tourette's,
505.89s - 507.73s |  other learning and disabilities.
507.73s - 512.05s |  And so we kind of all bundle these up when we talk about neurodiversity.
514.66s - 519.38s |  Here's another way of looking at these terms and making sure that we understand where we're at.
519.94s - 520.18s |  Right?
520.18s - 528.26s |  So if we talk about neurotypical, this is the group of folks that don't have specific
531.14s - 535.22s |  situations in which they find themselves in these other categories.
535.94s - 541.62s |  And so, but, you know, you can see that the autistic versus non-autistic
542.34s - 544.34s |  relapse with neurotypical.
544.34s - 548.18s |  And so there is this term that some folks have used, autistic.
548.74s - 555.94s |  And really that is a subset of the whole neurodiversity group.
557.22s - 563.38s |  Autistic, you know, the autistic being in that, in the neurodivergent.
563.38s - 567.62s |  And we'll see as we move forward, you know, how that all fits together.
572.67s - 574.11s |  So here's a little demonstration.
574.11s - 579.47s |  Now let's see how well this plays over this VR here.
579.47s - 586.11s |  And so if you're actually able to see the animation, it is a perception exercise.
586.11s - 591.57s |  And I mean, I can't get that fancy.
591.57s - 591.81s |  All right.
591.81s - 603.17s |  So, you know, if you were perceiving white dots moving across the field or black dots
603.17s - 608.77s |  moving across the field in opposite direction, then that is one way of perceiving this.
608.77s - 613.49s |  And the other way is to see it as a column that is rotating.
613.49s - 617.25s |  And what you're actually seeing is one side of a dot versus the other.
617.89s - 622.05s |  This kind of, this is one of the scientific studies.
622.05s - 625.09s |  This actually comes from a study.
625.09s - 632.21s |  And like I said, all the research in here is linked and available in my presentation.
632.77s - 640.21s |  And it basically goes in and demonstrates that the perception of this is one way of
640.21s - 650.45s |  having a physical perceivable change in the eye tracking and being able to show that neurodivergent
650.45s - 654.29s |  people do view the world in a different way.
654.29s - 658.69s |  And this was one of the demonstrations of seeing that in actual eye movement.
660.69s - 661.33s |  Moving forward.
662.45s - 663.17s |  There we go.
663.17s - 663.41s |  All right.
663.41s - 664.85s |  So, this is another demonstration.
665.65s - 670.69s |  Again, this will, you know, see how the technology gods work and see if the stream's over okay.
670.69s - 675.01s |  So, the concept here is called sensory gating.
675.01s - 682.61s |  And sensory gating is the ability to perceive one stream of data amongst a noise.
682.61s - 682.93s |  Right?
682.93s - 689.65s |  It's our ability to focus in on, you know, one thing and not focus in all the others.
690.13s - 695.17s |  And this is where neurodivergent people have a larger range here.
695.17s - 702.69s |  Where some, you know, have to have a larger, have it to have a very quiet place to be able
702.69s - 703.57s |  to focus.
703.57s - 710.29s |  Other people like, for example, me, I always did my studying in college at the local varsity.
710.29s - 710.61s |  Right?
710.61s - 715.17s |  And the noise of everything else allowed me to focus.
715.17s - 718.93s |  And so, this is also a demonstration.
718.93s - 720.77s |  So, getting into the demonstration.
720.77s - 723.57s |  This is called the cocktail party effect.
723.57s - 723.89s |  Right?
723.89s - 729.57s |  So, it's when you're at a cocktail party or let's say a DC404 meeting.
729.57s - 729.81s |  Right?
730.45s - 732.45s |  There's lots of things going on.
732.45s - 737.49s |  And can you perceive one conversation over another?
737.49s - 740.61s |  So, I'm going to go ahead and hit play here and see if this is coming through.
740.61s - 742.69s |  And if not, we'll just move on forward.
744.72s - 745.04s |  All right.
745.04s - 747.44s |  So, today I'm going to talk about four things.
747.44s - 750.08s |  These are the four critical things to remember.
750.08s - 752.64s |  The first is how we make a mystery of that.
752.64s - 753.76s |  For me, it's kind of strange.
753.76s - 758.56s |  Because essentially, the third thing is memory.
758.56s - 760.64s |  The fourth thing is knowledge.
760.64s - 762.00s |  That's going to change a lot.
762.00s - 764.64s |  So, what I did, for now, a lot of checks are real knowledge.
764.64s - 765.44s |  Checks are real magic.
765.44s - 766.96s |  And that made it really great.
766.96s - 771.20s |  Because that way, I could eat perceptions, you know, my tricks, and the knowledge for
771.20s - 771.84s |  my friends.
771.84s - 772.56s |  You know what I mean?
772.64s - 773.14s |  Okay.
775.50s - 776.00s |  There we go.
778.64s - 786.48s |  So, just as an example, and you can talk, you know, look at these videos and talk with
788.16s - 789.20s |  your friends.
789.20s - 794.16s |  And when you're talking about neurodiversity, and it really kind of opens up these
796.00s - 799.60s |  acknowledgments of our different strengths and weaknesses.
799.60s - 805.76s |  And knowing where people stand is really a useful tool to know that you are not alone.
806.48s - 809.60s |  Other people have these same situations.
809.60s - 817.76s |  And you can recognize that people like that are in your community and work for your company.
817.76s - 823.60s |  So, then we can look at making the workplace a better place for everyone.
823.60s - 830.88s |  And including those that have different needs when it comes to, you know, physical situations
830.88s - 831.38s |  like this.
838.46s - 839.26s |  All right.
839.26s - 842.62s |  So, you know, getting to the superpowers.
842.62s - 845.74s |  This was a fun put together.
847.10s - 854.70s |  This comes from a collection of different studies and feedback from, you know, talking
854.70s - 858.62s |  with the real autistic crowd on Twitter and other social media.
858.62s - 860.70s |  It's really great.
860.70s - 865.58s |  You know, if you are autistic, I have two sons that are autistic.
865.66s - 870.14s |  And, you know, I might have gifted them as well.
870.78s - 875.34s |  But, you know, if you can look at these, you know, some of these will jump out at you and
875.34s - 877.18s |  say, yes, okay, that makes sense.
877.74s - 881.50s |  This is why, you know, I'm different.
881.50s - 883.74s |  Is that, you know, I can do these things.
883.74s - 888.38s |  And these are the things that, you know, your superpowers that you can, you know, focus
888.38s - 889.50s |  on and grow.
890.06s - 895.34s |  You know, these are something to be proud of and really kind of strengthen.
895.74s - 898.78s |  So, like I said, some examples of autistic superpowers.
899.42s - 901.26s |  Now ADHD superpowers, right?
901.26s - 903.02s |  So this is my heart.
905.74s - 911.02s |  I've always thought that, you know, this is a particular strength of mine is my ability
911.02s - 912.22s |  to do multiple things.
912.78s - 916.94s |  My hyper focus has always got me tons of trouble, right?
916.94s - 921.42s |  And, you know, it's, you know, sitting there doing one thing for 20 hours.
923.02s - 924.70s |  But it's one of these, it is a strength.
925.34s - 932.54s |  And as a quick aside, let me bring up a situation that comes up very often.
932.54s - 937.82s |  They talk about management styles and telling people that they, you know, don't overwork,
937.82s - 940.14s |  don't, you know, burn yourself out.
940.14s - 941.42s |  And there is the truth of that.
941.42s - 944.86s |  Like we don't want to overwork our people and we definitely don't want to burn them
944.86s - 945.50s |  out.
945.50s - 952.06s |  But there are just types of people that have that hyper focus and they do work, you know,
952.06s - 953.18s |  long hours.
953.18s - 955.50s |  And that is just how they drive themselves.
955.50s - 956.30s |  It makes them happy.
956.30s - 962.54s |  It's what, you know, if they didn't complete their task, right, it would just bother them
962.54s - 965.82s |  and would not be able to do other stuff until they finish that one thing.
965.82s - 969.42s |  And so there's just people out there that need that type of work style.
969.42s - 971.82s |  So, sorry, bring back to the conversation here.
971.82s - 979.74s |  Just a quick aside about the great features that you need to, again, strengthen and bring
979.74s - 980.86s |  it, bring out yourself.
981.50s - 983.02s |  All right.
983.02s - 988.38s |  But it's not all candy and fun, right?
988.38s - 992.70s |  It is, there is some downsides to our neurodivergency.
992.70s - 994.86s |  And so let's talk about that, right?
994.86s - 997.74s |  So sensory overload is one of the most common.
997.74s - 1004.94s |  And sensory overload is, you know, a situation in which the, you know, talking again about
1004.94s - 1011.74s |  that perception gating or sensory gating is not being able to filter out the noise
1011.74s - 1015.26s |  around you to focus on the task at hand.
1015.26s - 1021.74s |  And sometimes the variety of sensory is so much that it is hard to function.
1021.74s - 1025.82s |  And so this is a demonstration that goes through that.
1025.82s - 1029.90s |  This is, I do want to have a kind of a content warning on this one.
1030.54s - 1034.06s |  It is a demonstration of sensory overload.
1034.06s - 1040.06s |  If you are prone to having sensory overload, this might be slightly triggering.
1040.06s - 1041.34s |  Maybe turn down your audio.
1041.90s - 1046.14s |  Or if you have headphones on, I just don't want this to bother other folks.
1046.14s - 1049.82s |  Because when I first found this video, it turned my stomach.
1050.54s - 1054.78s |  Just knowing that feeling is definitely true.
1054.78s - 1057.10s |  So let's go through and take a look at this.
1057.66s - 1060.54s |  And as a good example, if you have no idea what I'm talking about.
1061.42s - 1173.65s |  I'm autistic.
1174.69s - 1176.61s |  And I just get too much information.
1183.41s - 1184.69s |  Always have to take a breath of that.
1184.69s - 1191.65s |  So, you know, this is, you know, the downside of having these sensory imbalances is while
1191.65s - 1199.81s |  it allows us to do some amazing things, you know, there is sensory overload is real.
1199.81s - 1200.85s |  And it's a very physical.
1201.41s - 1209.89s |  And so that leads us to, you know, finding, you know, finding these situations and looking
1209.89s - 1216.51s |  at what is it going to do to help us unlock our superpowers, right?
1216.51s - 1222.67s |  So here's some other examples of some of these challenges beyond just the sensory.
1222.67s - 1232.99s |  Is that if we think about social interactions, the, you know, folks on the spectrum and really
1232.99s - 1238.67s |  a lot of neurodivergent folks have different challenges when it comes to social interactions.
1240.03s - 1246.27s |  Misinterpreting social cues, not understanding and really undertaking that there's a nonverbal
1246.83s - 1250.67s |  communication is a real challenge.
1250.67s - 1257.87s |  And so that's where, you know, remote work and, you know, VR and, you know, and being
1257.87s - 1265.47s |  able to, you know, interact with people in a different modality is very welcoming to
1265.47s - 1267.39s |  a large amount of neurodivergent folks.
1268.35s - 1269.15s |  Sensory overload.
1269.15s - 1270.35s |  We talked about those.
1270.35s - 1276.43s |  But it doesn't just deal with, you know, bright sounds and loud noises, smells, sometimes
1276.43s - 1277.71s |  just textures, tastes.
1278.59s - 1281.55s |  It is it's different for different folks.
1282.51s - 1284.91s |  And this also goes with information overload, right?
1284.91s - 1290.51s |  You know, some people, you know, if needing to have organizational, you know, being able
1290.51s - 1296.83s |  to take everything in and process it, you know, when folks have that processing disorder
1296.83s - 1299.87s |  that really gets frustrating and can really challenge folks.
1300.51s - 1305.55s |  Executive challenges, you know, being able to do time management.
1305.55s - 1310.83s |  As I, you know, laugh at myself for not being able to be focused on get the right time here
1310.83s - 1314.59s |  in the VR, you know, I'm showing my weaknesses.
1314.59s - 1316.19s |  So sticking to routines.
1316.19s - 1317.55s |  This is an interesting one.
1317.55s - 1323.79s |  I'm one of those, this is one of my weaknesses as well, because, you know, time management
1323.79s - 1325.79s |  is something I have to really work hard at.
1325.79s - 1328.43s |  It was something that did not come natural to me.
1329.31s - 1336.67s |  And I feel like, you know, as physically handicapped people use different devices, I've used technology
1336.67s - 1341.55s |  and lots of rigor to be able to function in society that's very time based.
1341.55s - 1346.43s |  So it's one of those to kind of call out that people have those weaknesses and figuring
1346.43s - 1349.63s |  out how we can strengthen those with the new tools that we're developing.
1350.83s - 1355.95s |  Mental health issues, you know, anxiety and depression is a big deal in neurodivergency.
1355.95s - 1361.71s |  And understanding that that kind of, you know, comorbidity with a lot of our, you know,
1362.75s - 1366.59s |  diagnoses is taking all that in.
1368.11s - 1374.43s |  And I also put anxiety and depression in the superpowers.
1374.43s - 1378.03s |  That's one thing I forgot to call out when we were looking over the superpowers.
1378.03s - 1386.51s |  But just as a call out here is that people that have dealt with depression a good bit
1386.51s - 1391.31s |  in their life see the world in a different way than people who have not.
1392.03s - 1400.19s |  And that perspective is a divergent or diverse perspective that is needed in technology fields,
1400.19s - 1400.83s |  right?
1400.83s - 1405.23s |  When I'm putting together a project plan, like, you know, it is really easy to sit there
1405.23s - 1407.55s |  and say, yes, I think this is all going to work.
1407.55s - 1412.19s |  And you go to implement the plan and all of your estimates are off, right?
1412.19s - 1414.99s |  You didn't think of all the bad things that could happen.
1414.99s - 1418.27s |  People that deal with anxiety and depression often do, right?
1418.27s - 1422.91s |  They have a lot more of a cautious nature because they know that they've dealt with
1422.91s - 1424.43s |  triggers all their lives.
1424.43s - 1429.23s |  So this is both a weakness and a strength that I wanted to call out.
1430.19s - 1437.55s |  And, you know, the additional challenges of our lack of accommodations, you know, it is
1437.55s - 1445.87s |  wonderful to see so many neurodivergent people finding enough happiness and support to get
1445.87s - 1448.83s |  through life and get into the workforce.
1448.83s - 1450.67s |  And this is really what we're seeing.
1450.67s - 1455.07s |  This is part of this movement is that, you know, previously, you know, we did a whole
1455.07s - 1463.55s |  lot of things that, you know, now we know is not a very useful way to treat or deal
1463.55s - 1465.07s |  with autistic people.
1465.07s - 1474.43s |  And, you know, those people that were harmed by that are helping us learn the way to be
1474.43s - 1482.27s |  able to, you know, give everyone a path to being, you know, well integrated in a society
1482.27s - 1487.15s |  and InfoSec needs to pull those folks in.
1487.15s - 1495.23s |  It is a place where all of our strengths really kind of really shine and is also a place in
1495.23s - 1499.23s |  which, you know, we have a lot of technology to help accommodate us.
1499.23s - 1507.79s |  And so InfoSec is just a great place to make sure that they're very, that we're welcoming
1507.79s - 1510.91s |  and, you know, give them a place to call home.
1513.79s - 1514.35s |  All right.
1514.35s - 1516.19s |  So why hire us?
1517.07s - 1524.67s |  Well, now we get into the, you know, it's not just Xavier saying that we're awesome,
1524.67s - 1525.23s |  right?
1525.23s - 1529.23s |  It is also, you know, a provable fact, right?
1529.23s - 1536.35s |  So here are some bits of data that will help you if you, you know, would like to take this
1536.35s - 1543.71s |  on in your environment, in your school or workplace of work and be able to talk to HR
1543.71s - 1550.27s |  or other teams that can help support being able to get a better accommodation for your
1550.27s - 1551.07s |  company.
1551.07s - 1557.71s |  Or if it's just a personal accommodation and you'd like to make some changes for your
1558.51s - 1566.03s |  personal experience, hopefully these different studies here will help with that.
1566.51s - 1572.11s |  So starting off, this is the greatest quote that you can come away with is that the Harvard
1572.11s - 1580.67s |  Business Review put together a program that, you know, pull in neurodivergent specific
1582.27s - 1590.83s |  recruiting and brought those folks in to do, in this case was a QA team that came in and
1590.83s - 1593.95s |  were 30% more productive than others.
1593.95s - 1598.27s |  I mean, just, that was a great headline to take away.
1599.15s - 1608.35s |  Other examples, JP Morgan and Chase, when they went on and built a program, they were
1608.35s - 1616.99s |  able to prove that their overall was up to 140% more productive than employees that had
1616.99s - 1617.87s |  been in the company.
1617.87s - 1623.87s |  Not just, you know, just slightly more productive, but over, you know, 100% more productive.
1623.87s - 1631.47s |  And so, you know, they saw that success and published, you know, their research.
1634.27s - 1637.95s |  There's a support group called Neurodiversity in the Workplace.
1637.95s - 1642.99s |  And their programs show that a 94% retention rate.
1642.99s - 1647.07s |  So from a hiring perspective, right, that is a huge plus.
1647.07s - 1652.59s |  It costs a lot of money to refill a role.
1652.59s - 1660.67s |  And so the retention rate for neurodivergent hires is if you've got a wonderful accommodating
1660.67s - 1666.35s |  workplace, you know, that you're going to find that most neurodivergent folks would
1666.35s - 1670.27s |  love to stay around and work for your company for quite a while.
1671.47s - 1681.39s |  And then Ultratesting is a company that hired, you know, nearly all of their staff are autistics.
1681.39s - 1684.91s |  And they, you know, are just having a great time.
1684.91s - 1687.55s |  There's, you know, so that company is called Ultratesting.
1687.55s - 1694.03s |  If you want to look them up, there's some really great use cases and shows that, you
1694.03s - 1699.07s |  know, it's not just, we need, you know, not just a sprinkling of neurodiversity, but if
1699.07s - 1701.79s |  you go all in, some really great things can happen.
1704.43s - 1704.83s |  All right.
1704.83s - 1710.03s |  So if you are in those positions where you are hiring, you are, you know, a leader, you're
1710.03s - 1716.51s |  up there at the forefront of being able to make changes in the workplace.
1717.23s - 1724.11s |  You know, here are some tips for you to take back to your HR team and talk about how we
1724.11s - 1729.71s |  can make our company more attractive to neurodiverse talent.
1730.27s - 1730.51s |  All right.
1730.51s - 1733.15s |  So first of all, it's looking at the hiring process.
1734.03s - 1740.91s |  How do you get the, get those folks in your funnel to begin with?
1740.91s - 1745.39s |  You're looking at that, you know, is, are you only looking at specific schools?
1746.11s - 1751.15s |  You know, then you're realizing that a lot of neurodivergent folks do not come up through
1751.15s - 1753.15s |  traditional secondary schools.
1754.83s - 1758.75s |  So looking at, you know, your hiring and criteria process, right?
1759.71s - 1767.55s |  Is making, is the, sorry, lost my spot on my notes here.
1771.09s - 1777.49s |  So yeah, rethinking the screening criteria to make sure that, you know, that we're not
1777.49s - 1779.17s |  screening them out before we get in.
1780.29s - 1788.21s |  For example, you know, just the application process and sometimes we'll screen out folks
1788.21s - 1793.41s |  because, you know, the challenge with getting into applying for a job.
1793.41s - 1801.89s |  So looking at those, look at your interview process, making sure that it is not a, you
1801.89s - 1807.09s |  know, well, you know, it's not overly stressful for neurodivergent folks, right?
1807.09s - 1809.57s |  You know, things like panel interviews, right?
1809.57s - 1814.85s |  When you get into a room and four people are staring at you and, you know, high pressure,
1814.85s - 1820.37s |  you know, that is not going to bring out the best in a lot of neurodivergent folks.
1820.37s - 1825.25s |  So just look for examples of those type of harsh interview tactics.
1826.29s - 1829.65s |  And then, you know, expand the different roles that are available.
1829.65s - 1835.09s |  You know, looking at, you know, and thinking of different ways of solving problems and
1835.09s - 1836.93s |  making sure we've got roles out there for everyone.
1838.29s - 1841.09s |  So create a conductive work environment, right?
1842.05s - 1845.09s |  Respect individual differences in communication and work styles.
1845.65s - 1848.77s |  You know, provide mentors and support systems.
1848.77s - 1851.73s |  You know, offer flexible work arrangements.
1851.73s - 1858.69s |  You know, these are examples that can make sure that you are really, you know, making
1858.69s - 1859.89s |  a home for folks.
1860.53s - 1866.61s |  Finally, we've got, you know, looking at once you've hired them, now how are you going to
1866.61s - 1870.69s |  make sure that they're going to be productive and happy and want to stick around?
1871.57s - 1877.97s |  Is making sure that they, you know, that you've enabled your managers to know how to
1877.97s - 1880.45s |  accommodate these people.
1880.45s - 1884.45s |  You know, it means, you know, looking at work at home arrangements.
1885.09s - 1888.69s |  Looking at different, you know, office seating arrangements.
1888.69s - 1895.89s |  And so understanding that and being able to be that flexible is will make your and make
1895.89s - 1902.91s |  everyone, you know, happier and more productive in your workplace.
1902.91s - 1903.47s |  All right.
1903.47s - 1904.59s |  Here is some other tools.
1905.23s - 1913.07s |  This is from a great program I found from the Center of Applied Autism Research in the
1913.07s - 1913.57s |  UK.
1914.11s - 1925.39s |  And it basically is a way of measuring your, you know, your environment and looking at
1925.39s - 1930.19s |  the, you know, basically giving yourself a score.
1930.19s - 1935.79s |  So that you can then, you know, make some changes and help improve your ability to,
1936.67s - 1940.11s |  you know, have a adaptive environment.
1940.83s - 1946.59s |  And so looking at this, you know, starting off at adapting, looking at the environment
1946.59s - 1948.99s |  specifically, you know, the sensory environment, right?
1948.99s - 1952.27s |  Does everyone have a place to work where they feel comfortable?
1952.83s - 1955.07s |  Ambient smells and visuals, right?
1955.07s - 1964.19s |  Lighting, you know, ear, the room layout, you know, open versus, you know, closed offices.
1964.99s - 1967.63s |  So that's the first measure, right?
1967.63s - 1969.15s |  A timely environment, right?
1969.15s - 1971.95s |  Has appropriate time been given to all the tasks, right?
1971.95s - 1977.95s |  Being able to make sure that you can communicate and be flexible on timescales.
1978.59s - 1985.55s |  And then making sure that there's, you know, procedural stuff is written out and expectations
1985.55s - 1986.35s |  are really out there.
1987.15s - 1988.67s |  Explicit environment, right?
1988.67s - 1993.47s |  Everything, is everything very explicit in the expectations?
1994.35s - 2001.79s |  You know, there are folks that are neurodivergent that really don't have the flexibility or
2002.19s - 2011.15s |  let's just say that it creates stress when things are not rigid and well understood.
2011.15s - 2019.31s |  And so that is a way of helping those people is making sure that you've got a very clear
2019.31s - 2020.67s |  and explicit environment.
2021.95s - 2022.67s |  And predictable.
2023.31s - 2028.43s |  So predictable ability is that, you know, I can, I know what to expect.
2028.51s - 2036.19s |  And when things happen, understanding that some people are going to react differently
2036.19s - 2037.47s |  to those changes.
2038.35s - 2044.51s |  So, for example, when COVID hit and we had to switch to work from home, you know, there
2044.51s - 2048.27s |  were people that were able to make that adjustment very easily.
2048.27s - 2049.55s |  Others that were not, right?
2049.55s - 2055.15s |  That's an example that's kind of very large and, but that this really looks at more of
2055.15s - 2062.19s |  the more subtle changes in the work environments that still might interrupt people's, you know,
2062.19s - 2063.07s |  day to day.
2063.07s - 2069.71s |  If they expect to have, you know, food available or, you know, coffee and those type of things
2069.71s - 2074.75s |  on a schedule, sometimes that predictability is really soothing.
2076.85s - 2081.17s |  So, like I said, if you're in the workplace and you need to be able to, you know, kind
2081.17s - 2089.01s |  of give yourself a way of scoring yourself over time so that you can implement some procedures
2089.01s - 2093.89s |  and show that this is a great program to reach out to.
2096.30s - 2096.54s |  All right.
2097.34s - 2100.62s |  And then, so here's a couple of resources to take away.
2100.62s - 2106.54s |  If you are, like I said, if you're a leader and you want to get in and help, here are
2106.54s - 2111.10s |  some different programs and communities that you can reach out to.
2112.06s - 2116.78s |  And you can, like I said, I'll make sure that these slides are available.
2117.42s - 2124.70s |  And also we have the, but I did want to talk specifically about the New York Diversity
2124.70s - 2125.42s |  Hub.
2125.42s - 2133.26s |  This is one of the places where, you know, I got a lot of specific toolkits and brochures
2133.26s - 2138.94s |  and to take to my HR and we're talking through and being able to implement some of these
2138.94s - 2139.18s |  things.
2139.18s - 2147.34s |  So, very usable resources and it's really good to kind of have that, you know, in a
2147.34s - 2148.62s |  way that's easily consumable.
2151.22s - 2157.14s |  But what if you're an individual and you need some help navigating this world?
2157.14s - 2161.38s |  So, there are great different, a lot of great different programs out there.
2162.02s - 2164.98s |  So, first off is I've got a collection of different job boards.
2165.54s - 2168.98s |  Now, some of these are more like the more traditional job boards where it's just I'm
2168.98s - 2172.90s |  going to go out and find neurodivergent jobs and pull them in.
2173.70s - 2180.26s |  Others work with companies to develop specific neurodivergent programs.
2180.26s - 2184.18s |  And so, it's a lot more targeted.
2184.18s - 2190.50s |  And so, if you are on the spectrum or you've got extreme ADHD or something that you're
2190.50s - 2196.66s |  looking for, companies that have specific accommodations, some of these job boards will
2196.66s - 2199.22s |  definitely be your ticket there.
2200.18s - 2205.30s |  And then, if you are in the workforce and you're looking for, you know, support, there's
2205.30s - 2207.38s |  a couple different support groups out there.
2207.94s - 2212.10s |  First off, each state has a state vocational rehab.
2213.62s - 2221.94s |  So, if you just, if you look, if you search for your state, you know, vocational rehab,
2221.94s - 2226.58s |  then you can, you know, find those websites that will allow you to see what resources
2226.58s - 2228.82s |  are available in your specific state.
2228.82s - 2234.50s |  And this is a great place to find all the local programs, local community programs,
2234.50s - 2239.30s |  you know, so that you could possibly find people that can help that really know your
2239.30s - 2246.58s |  community and able to, you know, find jobs or help you navigate an employee situation.
2247.54s - 2254.34s |  Other organizations out there, the AHRQ, Association for Autism and Neurodiversity,
2254.34s - 2259.94s |  and the Society for Neurodiversity, you know, are all different specific organizations to
2259.94s - 2271.30s |  help companies and individuals with, you know, understanding how to be, you know, most accommodating
2271.30s - 2272.18s |  in the workforce.
2272.18s - 2280.42s |  So, great resources out there and, you know, I really appreciate, you know, being a part
2280.42s - 2287.94s |  of this community and being able to present to you guys, you know, put my information
2287.94s - 2290.10s |  up there if you want to follow me.
2291.14s - 2296.98s |  I didn't go off on Twitter earlier, you know, I'll be nice today, but, you know, I'm on
2296.98s - 2299.78s |  Mastodon if you'd like to find me.
2299.78s - 2302.10s |  And, yeah, I'm still on LinkedIn.
2302.10s - 2304.58s |  That's about it for social media.
2305.62s - 2306.10s |  All right.
2308.42s - 2310.66s |  I guess we're out of time.
2310.66s - 2312.18s |  I think we've got some time for some questions.
2313.78s - 2315.22s |  Oh, yes, you have time for questions.
2320.30s - 2321.90s |  Oh, sorry, my phone was on.
2321.90s - 2323.10s |  Yes, you have time for questions.
2333.63s - 2336.03s |  You're standing outside the audio zone.
2336.03s - 2339.15s |  You won't be able to hear me back here.
2343.73s - 2345.97s |  This is giglio.
2347.09s - 2355.41s |  For the one that was the column that was rotating, which is the right, right?
2359.09s - 2359.73s |  Yeah, I can hear.
2361.01s - 2365.97s |  Yes, it's there is no right answer, right?
2365.97s - 2371.81s |  It is it's that and that's the point is that, you know, it is the way that we perceive the
2371.81s - 2378.53s |  world is our own, you know, it's and so, you know, if I say that that that is, you
2378.53s - 2384.21s |  know, it's a it's a cone or it's two sheets of, you know, or column or, you know, it's
2384.21s - 2385.97s |  it's it's it's the same thing.
2386.53s - 2391.17s |  There's another proverb about the elephant, blind people in the elephant, right?
2391.81s - 2396.05s |  Touching different parts of the elephant, describing it in different ways and trying
2396.05s - 2397.65s |  to convince the other that they're right.
2398.37s - 2401.09s |  But the point is, is they're all right.
2401.09s - 2403.33s |  And that's that's the same with that demonstration.
2404.13s - 2404.69s |  Cool, cool.
2404.69s - 2405.19s |  Thanks.
2426.96s - 2432.24s |  Yeah, I would like to, you know, I was when I was putting together this and trying to,
2432.24s - 2433.44s |  you know, shape it for this one.
2433.44s - 2438.32s |  I was looking for specific studies or any type of discussion around there and really
2438.32s - 2439.44s |  couldn't find too much.
2440.40s - 2445.92s |  But more like hopeful thinking, right, that that that the idea is that we're creating
2445.92s - 2454.80s |  another way to communicate and, you know, maybe that will unlock, you know, a communication
2454.80s - 2460.00s |  path for people that might have not found that comfort zone yet.
2460.00s - 2464.32s |  So it's but that really hasn't been too many studies on it yet.
2471.94s - 2473.86s |  Do we have any more questions from the speakers?
2481.39s - 2482.51s |  I was curious.
2483.79s - 2491.71s |  What types of technology education are available for neurodivergence in mind?
2494.08s - 2499.12s |  So I had one.
2499.12s - 2502.72s |  So, yeah, the these support groups here.
2504.32s - 2510.40s |  All have different resources, as do these these particular organizations here.
2511.28s - 2514.32s |  And so this one particular when we're talking about training,
2515.04s - 2519.36s |  optimize, that's kind of that's their product that they sell.
2519.36s - 2519.52s |  Right.
2519.52s - 2526.08s |  So they privatize that, but, you know, also have the community that they've built it around.
2527.12s - 2529.68s |  And so, so, yeah, so I will check that optimize.
2536.67s - 2543.63s |  And actually, what what is the best way to provide slides, you know, and make sure that
2543.63s - 2544.91s |  whoever would like to get these.
2546.43s - 2551.47s |  Well, if you send them to me as a PDF, I can post them on the wall over here.
2552.43s - 2553.39s |  Okay, we'll do.
2578.83s - 2583.71s |  I couldn't think of a question, but like, just want to say as someone who's
2584.75s - 2590.03s |  not that, sorry, sorry, neurodivergent, I hear myself twice as I speak.
2591.31s - 2593.07s |  I find it very enlightening.
2593.07s - 2599.15s |  Like, it's a point of view I haven't seen before and didn't feel like my environment for that.
2601.47s - 2602.43s |  I appreciate the feedback.
2602.43s - 2611.79s |  Yeah, it's something, you know, once you really kind of have the realization of, you know,
2611.79s - 2621.15s |  kind of knowing that this situation exists and really starting to identify that in society
2622.11s - 2628.99s |  and openly talking about it and being able to see how many people that you know that
2628.99s - 2631.63s |  really would fit into that neurodivergent crowd.
2632.19s - 2634.59s |  It's gonna be, it's gonna be surprising.
2634.59s - 2641.07s |  And we're a lot more of us are identify as neurodivergent than you would think.
2644.14s - 2647.58s |  Yeah, yeah, actually, I really connected with the part you said about depression,
2647.58s - 2652.14s |  because you pointed out like how they see the different point of view.
2652.14s - 2654.54s |  I always found myself to be a realist.
2654.54s - 2657.18s |  Like, not all people are good.
2657.18s - 2659.98s |  Nothing ever goes exactly to plan.
2660.06s - 2661.66s |  And I always pointed it out.
2661.66s - 2666.06s |  And hearing you speak about it from that angle, just made me think about myself a bit.
2667.66s - 2668.16s |  Wonderful.
2670.46s - 2671.82s |  I'm glad I could help.
2672.46s - 2673.10s |  Thank you.
2673.10s - 2674.46s |  Yeah, thank you.
