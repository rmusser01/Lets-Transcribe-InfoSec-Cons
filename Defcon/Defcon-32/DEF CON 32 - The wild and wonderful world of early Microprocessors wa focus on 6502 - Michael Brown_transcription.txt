  "title": "DEF CON 32 - The wild and wonderful world of early Microprocessors w/a focus on 6502 - Michael Brown",
  "description": "This presentation will be a combination of history lesson, technical introduction, and some demonstration. The target audience are those who may never had a chance to experience early microcomputers but want to get an introduction to the world of \u201cretro computing.\n\nToday everyone's laptop or smartphone either run an Intel, AMD, or ARM processor. And most probably can't tell you exactly what they have or know any details of them. It\u2019s all a black box to most. But back in the 70s and 80s, computer hobbyists & hackers knew they had a Z80, 6502, 6809, 68000 or other processor, and often knew the details and could and did program them in assembly. But while the industry has moved past the Apple II, Atari 400/800/XL/XE, Commodore 64 et al, there are still many who continue to use and enjoy these computers. Even to build and create new and exciting items for them as well as brand new systems using this old tech.\n\nIn this presentation, we will delve into microprocessor history of the 8-bit and early 16-bit systems, with a particular focus on the MOS 6502, one of the most popular microprocessors. We will touch a little on the systems that used the 6502, and take a quick look into how to program the 6502, even showing a couple of 6502-based systems. Importantly for many, we will delve into some of the resources available for those wishing to enter this world also.",

 Thank you all for coming.
1.60s - 7.70s |  This is the 12 o'clock talk on the wild and wonderful world of 8-bit microprocessors.
8.08s - 11.94s |  And I'll be doing a focus on the MOS6502.
12.24s - 13.54s |  I do apologize.
13.54s - 17.16s |  There is not much of a demo in this talk.
17.16s - 20.26s |  I was hoping to have more of a demo, but I've had some technical problems.
20.26s - 23.74s |  So, this, we're going to go more into more of history and technology.
24.08s - 27.54s |  For some of you, this might be stuff you've never heard of before.
27.98s - 29.32s |  That's what it's all about.
29.32s - 33.58s |  And I have quite a few slides with a lot of resources and information.
33.94s - 37.64s |  So, you're certainly welcome, and I encourage you guys to take pictures of them.
38.04s - 41.62s |  I've been actually adding to these slides.
41.90s - 44.34s |  So, they might not have, they're not going to have the latest version.
45.00s - 46.50s |  So, let me start.
46.50s - 47.52s |  My name is Michael Brown.
47.84s - 51.86s |  This is my normal bio I do with these talks, which I typically talk about InfoSec stuff.
52.26s - 54.20s |  This isn't an InfoSec talk.
54.20s - 56.80s |  So, I'm not going to really go over this.
57.32s - 58.66s |  But why am I here?
58.90s - 62.38s |  I actually grew up in the era of 8-bit computers.
62.38s - 67.40s |  You know, when I was a kid, it was the Apple II and the Atari 8-bit, Commodore 8-bit.
67.80s - 71.02s |  My first game console was an Atari 2600.
71.70s - 75.36s |  My first computer was actually an Atari 800XL,
75.82s - 78.46s |  which I got around in 84 when I was going to college.
78.98s - 86.22s |  And I can tell you that it was a big change going from writing papers on a typewriter
86.80s - 91.28s |  to using a word processor to write up my papers.
91.76s - 97.08s |  And I actually remember an incident when I turned in one of my first papers
97.08s - 101.28s |  to my English teacher that I use on the word processor.
101.66s - 109.12s |  And she marked off the fact that I didn't put quotes around the book, all the titles.
109.68s - 112.36s |  And I had to go and take it back to her and tell her, like, no, no, no, no, no.
113.00s - 115.58s |  I italicized the titles.
115.96s - 117.52s |  They don't need to be quoted.
118.56s - 119.84s |  And she didn't realize that.
119.84s - 121.74s |  And then, of course, gave me back the points.
122.28s - 124.76s |  Because that was just too new at that time.
126.00s - 129.34s |  My second computer was an Atari 1040ST-FM.
129.84s - 133.96s |  You will impress me if you come up afterwards and tell me what
133.96s - 136.70s |  that means without looking it up.
137.80s - 143.36s |  When I was in college, among other things, I actually did programming in the 6502 and the 68000.
144.02s - 146.60s |  You know, these are some of the computers I used.
146.60s - 150.16s |  And I used these wonderful programming languages that maybe some of you know of,
150.16s - 152.34s |  maybe you don't, later on I do see.
152.84s - 154.50s |  I still got my computers.
154.74s - 156.42s |  I've added to my collection.
156.42s - 157.78s |  I don't have a huge collection.
158.18s - 161.20s |  But I, you know, I enjoyed using these computers at the time.
161.54s - 164.00s |  I enjoy using modern computers.
164.54s - 170.98s |  What I find kind of disappointing with a lot of people who get into computer science is they,
171.36s - 173.12s |  because I'm a computer science major.
173.12s - 174.96s |  I was never a computer engineer.
175.24s - 177.94s |  I wasn't, you know, hardware wasn't what I was about.
177.94s - 179.28s |  I was about writing software.
179.58s - 184.68s |  But my view is always, from the beginning, was I'm writing software.
184.96s - 186.06s |  It runs on a computer.
186.06s - 187.56s |  I should know about the hardware.
188.14s - 191.60s |  And unfortunately, what I saw was a lot of computer science majors,
192.24s - 194.24s |  the computer was just a black box.
194.74s - 198.14s |  I remember talking to them and asking them, hey, what processor is in that computer?
198.14s - 200.68s |  And they're like, I don't know.
201.08s - 203.38s |  And of course, today it's even worse.
203.68s - 208.58s |  I know that my computer here, my laptop, is a Core i7.
208.58s - 216.42s |  But I'd have to look it up to find out which of the 20-some generations of the i7 it is
216.42s - 220.42s |  or what capabilities, because, you know, nowadays we're just pretty much oblivious.
220.90s - 226.00s |  So kind of the outline, we'll talk about some of the timeline, computer types.
226.44s - 229.64s |  We'll get into like some of the semiconductor companies,
229.64s - 231.08s |  which I find kind of interesting.
231.46s - 234.10s |  We'll look at, you know, more about the microprocessor units.
234.10s - 235.80s |  We'll look more at the 6502.
235.80s - 239.76s |  We'll talk a little bit about assembly language, which it's either something
239.76s - 243.30s |  that is really interesting to you or freaking boring.
243.76s - 247.16s |  You know, it's, or, you know, the worst thing possible.
247.16s - 249.92s |  And then I want to, I put together a lot of good resources,
249.92s - 252.16s |  at least a lot of things that I think are good resources.
252.52s - 255.56s |  So I encourage you guys to take pictures of that.
256.28s - 261.92s |  So the timeline, the 70s, which is what, as I said, this is when I was in high school, you know,
261.92s - 267.86s |  we had Intel came out with the 8080, which kicked off the microcomputer era.
267.86s - 272.94s |  We have the Altair, you know, followed up by other processors.
273.20s - 279.06s |  You know, you had the Apple II, the Commodore, you know, the TRS-80 Model 1,
279.06s - 285.44s |  the so-called Trash 80, as everyone called it, and so forth into the 70s.
285.44s - 288.38s |  The TI's computer, and the rest.
288.38s - 290.44s |  And then in the 80s, we get more.
290.44s - 298.36s |  We get the VIC-20, the Commodore 64, the IBM PC, the Macintosh, and then, of course,
298.36s - 301.52s |  you know, the Macintosh, the ST, the Amiga.
302.02s - 305.28s |  I didn't want to go further, because now we're getting outside of 8-bit.
305.28s - 310.62s |  When I was doing this, I wondered, should I get into RISC processors?
310.92s - 315.42s |  Because that's another whole, you know, topic, and that's kind of interesting and kind of sad.
315.86s - 318.76s |  So, I didn't want to kind of overwhelm things.
319.26s - 324.16s |  When we talk about computer types, there's a lot of different ways to categorize them.
324.46s - 327.62s |  These are the ones that I understood when I was into computer science.
327.62s - 332.56s |  We talked about the mainframes, you had minicomputers, and you had microcomputers.
333.06s - 339.66s |  And I'll be honest, this is the distinction I've always been told about what,
339.78s - 342.46s |  why is this a mainframe, why is this a minicomputer?
342.82s - 345.34s |  And usually, the way they said it's like, well, it's about size.
345.70s - 350.36s |  Your mainframes were your huge room-based computers, the ones you see in the TVs
350.36s - 353.40s |  and movies with the tape drives going and whatnot.
353.98s - 356.86s |  And the minicomputers were smaller, the size of a refrigerator.
357.52s - 363.16s |  Earlier on, it was, you know, these companies, you know, IBM and these others,
363.16s - 365.12s |  they were called Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
366.22s - 368.58s |  Through mergers, it became IBM and the Bunch.
369.12s - 375.70s |  And today, yes, mainframe computers are still being made, but now by these companies.
376.38s - 378.52s |  The minicomputers were kind of interesting.
378.52s - 382.40s |  You had, you know, digital and data, data general and all these others.
382.72s - 385.14s |  And they no longer exist.
385.62s - 388.64s |  You know, there are no minicomputers as a market.
389.02s - 393.88s |  And almost all those companies either don't exist or they've moved out.
394.74s - 398.90s |  Microcomputers started, of course, as the small, you know, more of a hobbyist,
399.26s - 402.32s |  getting into the business computers with MIT or the MITS,
402.82s - 406.46s |  MSci, Sol, you know, and the Apple, Atari, Commodore.
407.02s - 409.82s |  But as microprocessors became more and more powerful,
410.10s - 413.34s |  you now had microprocessor-based servers.
413.54s - 416.94s |  And those kind of moved in and wiped out the minicomputers.
417.60s - 421.92s |  And then I debated putting a lower level,
421.92s - 427.22s |  which would have been your microcontrollers, which in many cases are microprocessors being used
427.22s - 433.46s |  to control hardware, you know, disk drives and this sort of stuff.
433.46s - 436.30s |  So let's talk about micro semiconductor manufacturers.
436.30s - 437.24s |  This is kind of interesting.
437.58s - 440.52s |  The first major one is called Shockley Semiconductor.
440.90s - 446.10s |  It was founded by the guy who created transistors, a guy named William Shockley.
446.56s - 451.24s |  Unfortunately, Shockley was one of these people who was like a brilliant,
452.08s - 454.92s |  you know, scientist, a lousy manager.
455.72s - 457.12s |  So he established his company.
457.32s - 459.48s |  He brought all these engineers on board.
459.76s - 460.78s |  He trained them.
461.72s - 463.88s |  They didn't like working for him, and they left.
464.38s - 470.16s |  And these people, there was eight of them, and they are known as, and I'm not making this up,
470.60s - 475.58s |  they are the traitorous eight who left Shockley Semiconductor
475.98s - 479.32s |  to go found a new company called Fairchild Semiconductor.
479.96s - 483.38s |  And Fairchild was a subsidiary of Fairchild Camera.
483.80s - 490.76s |  And we have Fairchild Semiconductor for having Silicon Valley.
491.14s - 493.88s |  They literally created Silicon Valley.
494.30s - 496.38s |  They were established in California.
496.82s - 503.04s |  And then the funny thing was with Fairchild is many of the people that came to Fairchild left
503.72s - 508.00s |  to establish other companies, and sometimes even left those and established other companies.
508.30s - 510.56s |  And these are referred to as the Fairchildren.
511.34s - 514.92s |  And there's even, you can go online and you can see these charts of all these companies
515.20s - 517.82s |  that have been like second generation from Fairchild
517.82s - 521.32s |  that spread this knowledge of the semiconductors.
521.72s - 526.06s |  Fairchild's big claim to fame is that they were one of two companies
526.06s - 530.82s |  that created the integrated circuit that gives us all the computer chips that we use today.
531.54s - 533.96s |  They did create their own microprocessor,
533.96s - 537.72s |  which until recently I didn't even know existed, called the F8.
538.42s - 543.90s |  And they created their own game console called the Channel F, which I again have to admit,
544.70s - 547.94s |  I don't remember that when I was a kid.
548.46s - 552.96s |  But the big thing that made the Channel F important is it was the first one
552.96s - 557.62s |  to use ROM cartridges for the games, which became the standard
557.62s - 559.48s |  of all the game consoles that followed.
559.80s - 565.02s |  You know, all the Atari's used game consoles, the Nintendo and Super Nintendo
565.02s - 568.80s |  and the Sega Genesis and all those, all used ROM cartridges
569.06s - 571.36s |  until they came along sort of using CDs.
573.10s - 576.70s |  One of the big Fairchildren is this little company called Intel,
577.08s - 581.26s |  which was for, it stood for Integrated Electronics, very, very creative name.
581.76s - 586.84s |  And it was actually two of the guys that were the traders that went and founded Intel.
587.56s - 590.98s |  Intel, when they were established, made memory chips.
591.26s - 592.40s |  That's really what they did.
594.14s - 599.94s |  But what made a difference is when, was when a Japanese calculator company went to them
599.94s - 607.20s |  and said, hey, we need some chips made because we're going to make four sets of calculators
607.62s - 611.02s |  and we need chips in them to make them function.
611.40s - 615.16s |  And they were saying like, well, okay, we have four calculators with different features.
615.50s - 621.42s |  So why don't you make us four sets of chips for these four calculators?
621.84s - 625.58s |  But one of the engineers at Intel said like, no, that's not a good idea.
625.94s - 632.84s |  Let's make one set of chips that we can program and use in all four of these.
633.20s - 639.76s |  And that, what they created was the 4004, which is a four-bit processor.
640.60s - 642.82s |  That was actually the first microprocessor.
643.10s - 645.44s |  It was then replaced with a better 4040.
646.18s - 650.66s |  And then shortly thereafter, another calculator company came with the same thing
651.06s - 657.52s |  and the same engineers then created the 8008, now an eight-bit processor.
657.84s - 661.52s |  And then they made it better and created the 8080.
662.62s - 666.28s |  And again, they created these to be used in calculators.
666.56s - 669.70s |  No one created these for being used in computers.
670.04s - 675.12s |  It took other people to look at this and go like, hey, I can take this 8080 chip
675.68s - 677.44s |  and make it into a computer.
678.14s - 683.82s |  And those were the guys at MITS or MITS, depending on what you believe is the name
683.82s - 690.46s |  of the company, and that was the Altair 8800, which was, it's not the first personal
690.46s - 697.24s |  computer, but it was the first commercially available personal computer.
697.46s - 698.84s |  And that kicked it all off.
699.04s - 702.46s |  And of course, the people that wanted these were more people that were hobbyists and
702.46s - 703.10s |  engineers.
703.10s - 707.32s |  They, you know, at that time, as I said, you had many computers and mainframes that
707.64s - 710.36s |  you didn't get to sit at and work on the computers.
710.68s - 716.18s |  People wanted their own computer that they could have and can work on and do stuff
716.20s - 721.28s |  with, as well as now they can be used for practical purposes and businesses.
722.96s - 728.68s |  Shortly thereafter, Intel created the 8086, which is now a 16-bit processor.
729.60s - 732.74s |  And that then, of course, was used for more powerful computers.
733.22s - 739.40s |  They then started a series of kind of iterations that gave us the 80186 and so
739.40s - 742.88s |  forth. You know, the 286, the 386.
743.14s - 748.02s |  The 386 is now a 32-bit processor, so now we're moving up and becoming more and more
748.02s - 756.66s |  powerful. And the 486, the next one was supposed to be the 8586, but instead,
756.66s - 762.06s |  Intel decided to call it a Pentium because you can't copyright a number, but you can
762.06s - 763.06s |  copyright a name.
764.18s - 766.88s |  And then with the Pentium, there was all the various different variations of the
766.88s - 771.10s |  Pentium, which, I'm sorry, I can't, I couldn't keep up with it even at the time.
771.10s - 775.28s |  We had the Pentium 2 and the 3 and the 4 and the DX and so forth.
776.20s - 779.44s |  I think around the Pentium 4 is when they went to 64-bit.
781.48s - 784.36s |  Intel also tried their hand at RISC processors.
784.64s - 788.00s |  That's the i86, 860 and 960.
789.12s - 789.96s |  Those are dead.
790.92s - 795.80s |  Most of the other ones, they actually made them for several decades, but then stopped
795.80s - 798.76s |  doing so. And then there was also the Itanium.
798.80s - 801.00s |  That was another architecture they tried out.
801.40s - 805.20s |  That was useful for a while, and it's also dead.
805.60s - 810.12s |  Nowadays, it's the one on the next line, the Atom and the Celeron, which are the
810.12s - 814.64s |  low-power ones for, meant for like tablets and embedded systems.
815.28s - 822.40s |  The Core 3579, which for laptops and desktops, and then the Xeon for servers.
823.84s - 827.56s |  One thing that I've noticed in the last few years with Intel, and maybe others of
827.56s - 833.54s |  you have noticed the same thing, is that Intel is still pretty big with desktops and
833.54s - 836.54s |  laptops and servers, but that's it.
838.54s - 842.34s |  They, you know, they tried getting into smartphones.
842.82s - 843.86s |  That didn't go.
844.42s - 848.54s |  They tried getting into like the Arduino space.
848.58s - 851.58s |  There was actually an Intel-based Arduino called the 101.
852.18s - 853.30s |  That didn't last.
853.80s - 858.64s |  They tried getting into the single board computer like the Raspberry Pi.
859.28s - 864.04s |  I'm not sure how many people here remember the Minnow board that they put together.
864.68s - 865.68s |  That didn't last.
865.96s - 872.44s |  They tried other little IoT devices like the Edison, which, you know, I got and several
872.44s - 880.64s |  others. And, you know, it's like outside of desktop servers and laptops, Intel doesn't
880.64s - 882.20s |  exist. Everything else is ARM.
883.10s - 887.94s |  You know, every one of you who has a smartphone with you, that's an ARM-based
887.94s - 892.30s |  processor. You know, I seriously doubt you have anything that's not an ARM-based
892.30s - 899.70s |  smartphone. ARM is now being used by Apple for their systems.
901.14s - 906.90s |  There is actually already, we're seeing ARM-based laptops that'll run Windows.
907.34s - 909.46s |  I'm hearing of ARM-based servers.
909.82s - 912.18s |  So I don't know what that means.
912.74s - 913.94s |  So it's kind of interesting what's happening.
915.74s - 921.78s |  Subbing back, I mentioned that certain engineers at Intel had created the 4040 and
921.78s - 927.78s |  8080. Those were a gentleman by the name of Federico Fagan, along with a Japanese
927.78s - 930.50s |  engineer named Masatoshi Ishima.
931.10s - 938.90s |  They actually left Intel to form Zilog, which is, and I'm not joking, it was picked
938.92s - 942.72s |  because it's the last name in integrated electronics.
943.36s - 950.60s |  And they created the Z80, which was a much improved version of the 8080, so improved
950.92s - 957.16s |  that the Z80 in the market kind of displaced the 8080 from systems.
957.16s - 961.48s |  And so everyone who was using what would have been an 8080-based system was using a
961.54s - 970.66s |  Z80. And until April of this year, they were still manufacturing the original Z80 chip
970.94s - 971.86s |  and selling it.
973.46s - 974.90s |  That's not the end of the Z80.
974.90s - 979.38s |  They have replacement chips such as the EZ80 you can still get.
979.38s - 982.42s |  So you can still get Z80 chips and use them.
982.82s - 984.58s |  They try their hand at others.
984.58s - 988.08s |  They did a Z800, which is a 16-bit processor.
988.92s - 992.80s |  And then they went with a 32-bit with a Z80,000.
993.00s - 997.40s |  And if you're like, I never heard of those, well, it wasn't that successful.
999.40s - 1005.08s |  These are what we refer to, and I don't know if I, where I got the term from, is these
1005.08s - 1009.88s |  are the eights, that almost the processors use the letter eight, the number eight on
1009.88s - 1014.48s |  it. The other set that we talked about that's really major starts off with
1014.48s - 1019.74s |  Motorola. They start off with the Z, the 6800 processor.
1020.78s - 1022.30s |  It had some success.
1022.98s - 1029.10s |  A lot of the early computer companies, MITS and MSCI, did release 6800-based systems
1029.10s - 1031.90s |  with an 8-bit processor, but it wasn't that big.
1032.50s - 1037.82s |  They replaced it with a more powerful 6809, which is an 816-based system.
1038.26s - 1043.74s |  Probably its claim to fame is it was one used in the Tandy color computer.
1044.54s - 1046.10s |  Which was used for many years.
1046.26s - 1052.18s |  And I was actually really surprised to learn how much involvement Motorola had in
1052.18s - 1055.62s |  actually the creation of the color computer, which I never knew.
1055.62s - 1057.86s |  I learned that, you know, like the last couple of years.
1059.86s - 1065.46s |  Then, of course, much more famously is the 6800, sorry, 68000, which is, of course,
1065.46s - 1070.50s |  used in the Macintosh, the ST, the Commodore, many Unix workstations.
1070.72s - 1074.48s |  Sega Genesis used it and so forth.
1074.92s - 1076.96s |  So a very, very popular processor.
1077.36s - 1084.60s |  They then extended out, the 68000 is a 1632-bit system, and then the full 32-bit was
1084.60s - 1087.88s |  a 68020, or the 020, as we call it.
1088.40s - 1093.72s |  And there was a progression of those, the 020 to 060, which was used in subsequent
1093.72s - 1097.52s |  Macintoshes, Amigas, and Atari systems.
1098.26s - 1103.50s |  Motorola also got into trying their hand at RISC processors with the 88000.
1104.54s - 1116.50s |  However, in the mid-90s, they got involved with the AIM consortium, which was Apple, IBM,
1116.80s - 1128.64s |  and Motorola to compete against the Windows, sorry, the Microsoft Intel duopoly.
1129.60s - 1133.12s |  And they were going to make, you know, and part of that was the PowerPC.
1133.52s - 1138.68s |  Now, the PowerPC was a RISC-based architecture from IBM, but the idea was
1138.68s - 1141.76s |  that Motorola and IBM would create the chips.
1142.06s - 1147.54s |  Motorola, IBM, and Apple would all build PowerPC systems.
1149.18s - 1152.14s |  Apple would move Macintosh to PowerPC and so forth.
1152.86s - 1156.38s |  The funny thing is, as I was actually at IBM at that time and then went to
1156.38s - 1162.02s |  Motorola, so I got to see a lot of PowerPC-based systems that never got to
1162.02s - 1162.46s |  market.
1162.50s - 1165.70s |  There were some cool ones, but that's just how it is.
1166.68s - 1172.16s |  Going back to the 6800, as I said, that was Motorola's, you know, 8-bit processor
1172.16s - 1175.28s |  initially, and there were some problems with it.
1175.28s - 1180.92s |  One thing they discovered from feedback from their customers or potential customers
1181.24s - 1184.68s |  was that, one, they thought it was just a little bit too powerful for what they
1184.68s - 1190.48s |  needed, but more importantly, a lot of their potential customers thought it was
1190.48s - 1192.08s |  too expensive as a chip.
1192.14s - 1198.78s |  Motorola was charging over $300 for a chip, and you need to understand that when
1198.78s - 1204.42s |  you're building a system, yes, your CPU chip is important, but there's also other
1204.42s - 1209.14s |  chips you need, and if it's already $300 for that CPU chip, and then add the
1209.14s - 1212.74s |  others, then you have kind of an expensive system, and that was a problem.
1213.10s - 1217.50s |  One of the engineers at Motorola by the name of Chuck Peddle was involved with
1217.50s - 1223.08s |  that, and he was, like, trying to work out a low-cost alternative at Motorola for
1223.08s - 1229.64s |  the 6800 until basically Motorola told him to knock it off, yeah, and so he
1229.64s - 1233.12s |  wasn't happy by that, and some of those people weren't happy, so they left
1233.12s - 1236.88s |  Motorola, and this was a group of people that included Chuck Peddle, an
1236.88s - 1242.28s |  associate by the name of Bill Minch, and they left Motorola, and they went to the
1242.28s - 1245.24s |  next company on the slide there.
1245.86s - 1251.30s |  So let me make a couple of things really clear about this company, because a lot
1251.30s - 1253.94s |  of people get this wrong, get these two things wrong.
1253.98s - 1258.26s |  I've seen it in YouTube channels, on videos on YouTube that are incorrect.
1258.46s - 1262.02s |  So first of all is, how do you say its name?
1263.66s - 1267.14s |  If you think it's MOS Technology, you're wrong.
1267.74s - 1274.22s |  It is MOS Technology, because you don't want to confuse it with another company
1274.24s - 1279.88s |  that exists at the time called MOS Tech, which I listed up there, and that's very
1279.88s - 1284.56s |  true, because I know as a kid, well, at that time, I was even confused myself.
1285.56s - 1291.12s |  The next thing that I've seen that several videos would claim is that Chuck
1291.12s - 1295.88s |  Peddle and the other guys from Motorola founded MOS Technology.
1296.12s - 1297.20s |  No, they did not.
1297.56s - 1303.08s |  MOS had already been in existence for several years as a, again, as a memory
1303.26s - 1306.58s |  company. They just joined the company.
1306.94s - 1311.58s |  There, they created two chips, the 6501 and the 6502.
1312.14s - 1317.66s |  And if you're going, well, I've heard of the 6502, I never heard of the 6501.
1317.70s - 1319.34s |  Well, there's a reason, let me explain it.
1320.70s - 1325.34s |  These two chips are largely, are mostly the same in terms of architecturally.
1326.38s - 1329.22s |  It was meant to be a scaled down version of 6800.
1329.22s - 1331.46s |  I'll show, I'll show, I'll explain that shortly.
1331.96s - 1334.16s |  But there were some differences.
1334.60s - 1341.48s |  The main difference is the 6501 was pin compatible with a 6800.
1341.72s - 1349.12s |  That means if you're, if you have a board that you designed to use the 6800, you
1349.12s - 1355.04s |  can then go get a 6501, which would be way, way, way cheaper, and plop it in and
1355.04s - 1356.64s |  off you, off you run.
1356.92s - 1360.40s |  Yeah, the opcode would not be compatible, you would still have to program it.
1360.62s - 1364.02s |  But you would save your development time because you've got, you know, you've
1364.02s - 1365.50s |  already got a board that'll use it.
1366.74s - 1369.14s |  Motorola didn't like that, and they sued them.
1369.38s - 1371.46s |  So they never brought it to market.
1371.70s - 1375.58s |  I don't understand how you can sue over that.
1375.58s - 1378.18s |  I mean, you, you know, you copyright your pinouts.
1378.18s - 1379.34s |  I don't, I don't understand that.
1379.58s - 1384.78s |  Because Intel didn't, as far as I know, never, never, you know, sued Zilog about
1384.78s - 1385.58s |  the Z80.
1386.22s - 1388.06s |  So I don't understand that.
1388.08s - 1392.32s |  So anyway, so the 6502 is what came out, they did make a lot of different
1392.32s - 1394.92s |  derivatives, things that were like slightly different, different of it, and
1394.92s - 1395.56s |  so forth.
1395.92s - 1401.40s |  MOS technology existed in a separate company, Commodore later soon bought them
1401.40s - 1401.88s |  out.
1402.36s - 1404.84s |  So they would have a ready source of chips.
1405.00s - 1408.36s |  So they also were the ones that manufactured the specialized chips for
1408.36s - 1410.36s |  the Commodores and the Amiga computers.
1412.20s - 1416.08s |  And unfortunately, MOS went under when Commodore went under.
1416.26s - 1422.02s |  However, one of the other guys I mentioned, Bill Minch, he left Commodore
1422.54s - 1426.74s |  and formed his own company called Western Design Company.
1427.18s - 1430.50s |  I had to be kind of careful, sometimes I say Western Digital, which is wrong.
1431.94s - 1437.70s |  And then he licensed the 6502 chip to make it because that was the common
1437.70s - 1440.30s |  thing there is you'd have multiple companies making chips.
1440.82s - 1445.50s |  Then what he did was he teamed up with with a couple other companies that were
1445.50s - 1446.88s |  making 6502.
1447.16s - 1451.92s |  And they developed a new version of it called the 65CO2.
1451.92s - 1454.56s |  The C means it's made using CMOS.
1455.76s - 1458.08s |  And it's an improved version of 6502.
1458.28s - 1461.28s |  They fixed some bugs, they added some opcodes.
1462.40s - 1464.60s |  And they still make them today.
1465.04s - 1469.36s |  You want a 6502 chip today, you can still buy them, they're a few bucks.
1469.56s - 1474.24s |  You can go to like DigiKey and Mouser and those guys and you can still get it.
1474.50s - 1477.86s |  Shortly thereafter, he made a new version.
1478.14s - 1485.02s |  And that's the 65816, which is an 816 bit version of the 6502.
1485.26s - 1493.18s |  It can emulate fully the 6502 or can go, you know, an 816 bit processor.
1494.10s - 1500.18s |  It's best known and use has been in the Apple IIgs, which was not quite the last
1500.18s - 1502.42s |  Apple II, but probably one of the best ones.
1502.84s - 1505.76s |  And it was used in the Super Nintendo.
1506.36s - 1509.36s |  So if you use a Super Nintendo, guess what, you use that.
1510.04s - 1515.84s |  So that's and these, as the other group is compute processor, that's the eights.
1516.00s - 1517.64s |  So these are the sixes.
1518.76s - 1522.08s |  There are a few other companies, I just want to quickly mention Texas Instrument.
1523.56s - 1526.40s |  Huge in calculators, still big in calculators.
1527.28s - 1530.88s |  But I was surprised to learn that that for a period of time, they actually made
1530.88s - 1532.08s |  many computers.
1533.40s - 1540.00s |  They took that architecture and made a processor called the TMS 9900, which they
1540.00s - 1545.84s |  used in their computer called the TI 99 slash four, which I remember it, it was,
1546.48s - 1551.72s |  it was an interesting computer, I'll say it that say it that way, that the
1551.72s - 1554.04s |  processor was an 816 processor.
1554.24s - 1559.52s |  The problem was, was, you know, I, there's debate whether it was kind of a
1559.52s - 1563.22s |  crippled design because of infighting within the company.
1563.34s - 1564.90s |  So it wasn't very successful.
1566.34s - 1571.58s |  Another company, which is I thought I should list more as a could have been is
1571.58s - 1573.02s |  National Semiconductor.
1573.78s - 1576.66s |  They had a series of chips called the 32,000.
1577.16s - 1584.18s |  And I do know that Atari looked at them, maybe Amiga looked at them as possibly
1584.62s - 1588.58s |  then the processor for the next generation, but they didn't go with them
1588.60s - 1591.12s |  and said they went to motor with Motorola 68,000.
1591.40s - 1595.08s |  So who knows what might have happened if that didn't, that didn't go.
1595.92s - 1598.60s |  The last one I'll mention is RCA.
1598.64s - 1600.84s |  Yes, yes, that's Radio Communications of America.
1601.24s - 1604.68s |  They had an 8-bit processor called the 1802.
1605.32s - 1608.36s |  All I would say for that is take a look at that on Wikipedia.
1608.36s - 1609.60s |  It's very, very interesting.
1609.88s - 1614.12s |  They actually use that in space probes.
1614.88s - 1616.28s |  So kind of insane.
1616.50s - 1619.74s |  Now, if you're like, well, you forgot this company, you forgot that company.
1619.74s - 1621.02s |  There are other companies out there.
1621.26s - 1623.38s |  A lot of them, all they do is they make chips.
1623.58s - 1625.22s |  They don't design chips.
1626.14s - 1633.34s |  Even today, Apple designs their own software, their own silicon, the M1, 2, 3,
1633.34s - 1635.06s |  and 4, but they don't make it.
1635.30s - 1639.46s |  They go to another company and say, here, here's a design, make us these chips.
1640.50s - 1645.06s |  ARM, you know, ARM is nothing more than, you know, a licensing company.
1645.48s - 1646.88s |  They don't make ARM chips.
1647.12s - 1649.08s |  They design the ARM architecture.
1649.24s - 1653.64s |  They give it to other companies like Broadcom and all the others, and they make it.
1654.36s - 1658.08s |  You know, this has a, you know, an ARM processor in it.
1658.20s - 1659.16s |  ARM didn't make it.
1659.56s - 1664.08s |  They went to Broadcom and, you know, which is part, you know, tied to the Raspberry Pi
1664.08s - 1665.40s |  people, and they made it.
1665.40s - 1666.44s |  That's just how it is.
1668.36s - 1671.52s |  I thought I should make, I should mention this because a lot of people don't
1671.52s - 1674.32s |  understand again about, you know, if you don't understand the history of computers,
1674.78s - 1678.38s |  when you think about the IBM PC and they, some people think how, oh, how radical it
1678.38s - 1683.22s |  is and, you know, it's standardized things, and that's just not quite the way it was.
1683.22s - 1688.18s |  In the early seventies, we did have a standard, which was, you know, many
1688.18s - 1692.26s |  companies, and I mentioned several, you know, Altair, M-Sci, Promenco, and a lot
1692.26s - 1697.22s |  of these others who built standard business computers, they used, used the Z80
1697.22s - 1703.10s |  chip, they had what was called the S100 bus, which also known as the Altair bus,
1703.10s - 1709.12s |  which was an IEEE standard bus up until the 19, the mid nineties, people were
1709.12s - 1717.08s |  still making S100 based systems, and they use CPM as the operating system.
1718.56s - 1721.72s |  But unfortunately, other than that, there was, there was little standards that, you
1721.72s - 1726.24s |  know, floppies, dries was all of those, you had eight, you know, eight inch, you
1726.24s - 1730.64s |  had five and a quarter, you had, you know, you might not know what the, what I mean
1730.64s - 1735.66s |  by hard sector and soft sector, double sided, double density, you know, is all a
1735.66s - 1738.86s |  lot of complexity with these things, it was pretty crazy.
1740.50s - 1745.46s |  Look into the CPM operating system, again, it's one of like, what might have
1745.46s - 1752.90s |  been CP, we might have been using CPN instead of MS-DOS, if certain things had
1752.90s - 1759.74s |  not gone certain ways, it's either a, either a ridiculous story, or a sad story,
1759.74s - 1761.04s |  or however you want to look at it.
1763.24s - 1766.44s |  So it goes a little beyond what I wanted to talk about here, but it is
1766.44s - 1767.04s |  interesting.
1769.24s - 1775.08s |  So, um, I don't know if people, I've been saying things like eight bits, 16
1775.08s - 1777.48s |  bit, I've even said that I ate 16.
1778.44s - 1780.76s |  Does anyone know understand what the hell I'm saying?
1780.98s - 1786.68s |  When I say these things, I see some hand raised, okay, good, if that's the case,
1786.68s - 1789.94s |  because a lot of people don't, it's ridiculous.
1791.58s - 1797.54s |  To give you an example, the Atari came out with one of their game consoles
1797.54s - 1804.10s |  toward the end called the Jaguar, which they toted as being a 64 bit system.
1804.66s - 1810.22s |  And their, their marketing tagline was, you know, do the math.
1810.86s - 1815.70s |  But if you look at the system, and I'm pretty positive that no, it was not a
1815.72s - 1817.28s |  64 bit system.
1817.56s - 1820.60s |  It was, I think either 16 or 32.
1820.74s - 1824.80s |  That's the problem with these terminologies is that we as technology
1824.80s - 1828.00s |  people, we understand that, oh, this is an eight bit system.
1828.00s - 1829.14s |  This is a 16 bit.
1829.28s - 1831.08s |  Oh, yeah, we haven't, we can have an eight 16.
1831.08s - 1832.76s |  That's in between, that's more powerful.
1833.08s - 1837.52s |  But then you get to these marketing dweebs, and they just do ridiculous
1837.52s - 1837.84s |  things.
1837.84s - 1841.80s |  I came across an article around this time where they talked about this system,
1842.04s - 1844.36s |  and they were claiming it was a 64 bit system.
1844.36s - 1848.86s |  And I'm like, wait, wait a minute, I know what the processor is in that system.
1849.06s - 1851.86s |  It isn't, it isn't a 64 bit.
1851.86s - 1855.50s |  And I'm reading the article and realizing that the person who wrote it was like
1855.52s - 1860.94s |  adding things together, like, oh, well, it's, you know, I'm taking the address
1860.94s - 1865.26s |  bus and the data bus and this and I'm adding them all together in a 64 bit.
1865.26s - 1866.54s |  So it's a 64 bit system.
1866.54s - 1869.46s |  And I'm like, no, that's not how it works.
1869.56s - 1875.64s |  I was also surprised to learn, because only because I never use these computers
1875.64s - 1882.24s |  that we also had 12 and 24 bit and 48 bit computers at one time, which I was
1882.24s - 1884.56s |  surprised, but I never I never use those.
1885.52s - 1889.52s |  You know, when we talk about processors, these the things we look at, you know,
1889.52s - 1892.62s |  clock speed, I remember people think that clock speed is real important.
1892.88s - 1894.96s |  And it's not as important as people think.
1895.90s - 1900.02s |  If you go and watch these YouTube videos where people are doing it, you know,
1900.02s - 1903.02s |  they're looking at a new board and seeing how powerful it is, they're not
1903.02s - 1906.38s |  going and looking at the dang clock speed, they're going to run benchmarks
1906.54s - 1909.58s |  to see, oh, how fast can it do these things.
1909.74s - 1911.02s |  So that's more important.
1912.06s - 1919.70s |  But this is kind of interesting is that the 6502 has a 0.43 versus a 68,000 of 0.75.
1919.98s - 1924.50s |  If that's not clear, that means that the 6502 is actually faster than the
1924.50s - 1925.72s |  68,000.
1926.28s - 1930.20s |  But that's also gets into logic of, you know, why, why we went with RISC
1930.20s - 1933.64s |  processors, because, you know, they're more powerful, because they're kind of
1933.64s - 1934.40s |  stripped down.
1935.80s - 1939.08s |  The address bus is entering that tells us how much memory we can access.
1939.40s - 1943.88s |  Almost all eight bit systems have a 24 bit address bus, which which is why they
1943.88s - 1946.44s |  only have 64 k of memory.
1947.76s - 1951.36s |  The size number register is kind of interesting, because you got some CPUs
1951.36s - 1956.78s |  that have like, one or two registers, and others would like multiple, if you
1956.78s - 1959.66s |  don't understand what I mean by a register, that's the storage space, if
1959.66s - 1962.98s |  you will, within the processor, if you're going to do anything, you have to
1962.98s - 1966.30s |  pull it out of memory, pull it into the processor and work with it.
1966.90s - 1969.90s |  The data bus is what's important, because that's the that's the, that's
1969.90s - 1973.90s |  the highway, the data highway within the computer, that data is moving around.
1974.10s - 1978.30s |  If you got an eight bit processor, all the auxiliary chips need to be eight
1978.30s - 1980.46s |  bit, you can't be mixing and matching.
1982.06s - 1987.82s |  So I always like to throw this out, which is the IBM PC, which had all these
1987.82s - 1988.82s |  capabilities.
1989.58s - 1992.14s |  How many people think this was a 16 bit system?
1993.24s - 1995.26s |  How many people think this was an eight bit system?
1996.02s - 1997.14s |  Okay, good.
1997.14s - 2002.66s |  It's an eight bit system, because the 8088 processor is really an eight 16 bit
2002.66s - 2003.46s |  processor.
2003.62s - 2007.90s |  So the PC is an eight bit system, even though most people think it's 16 bits.
2008.40s - 2010.00s |  A lot of the
2011.92s - 2015.60s |  I really can't call them a clone in the early days more than IBM compatible.
2015.92s - 2022.44s |  They were full 16, because they either use the 8086, or the 8186, and so forth.
2022.78s - 2024.40s |  So it's actually kind of interesting.
2025.44s - 2027.44s |  So let's get into the these chips.
2027.44s - 2029.12s |  I talked about the 6800.
2030.04s - 2031.76s |  These are the specs, I'm not going to read it.
2033.08s - 2034.60s |  That's actually what they look like.
2035.42s - 2039.10s |  Please note, it had 72 instructions, what we call opcode.
2040.14s - 2043.02s |  As I said, it was really cost $360.
2043.02s - 2045.14s |  That was in 70s dollars.
2046.06s - 2049.98s |  Then over time, they reduced it to $179, then to $69.
2050.42s - 2052.46s |  I don't know how long they were making this.
2052.46s - 2056.66s |  But what I've been able to see is they were, they were still making these for
2056.66s - 2058.22s |  probably a couple of decades.
2059.98s - 2065.04s |  Now, I was trying to find a similar chart that what I show here.
2065.06s - 2069.62s |  For the 6502, but this I thought that was useful, because again, people need to
2069.62s - 2073.82s |  understand that when a company makes a processor, they're making other chips to
2073.82s - 2074.90s |  work with it.
2075.22s - 2078.42s |  So in this case, you see that, you know, you have the 68,000 processor.
2078.74s - 2081.38s |  In this case, they have a separate chip for the for the clock.
2082.74s - 2085.22s |  Then they have, of course, chips for ROM and RAM.
2085.94s - 2090.50s |  And then they have a PIA, that's a Peripheral Interface Adapter, that's and
2090.50s - 2092.18s |  then of course, a communications adapter.
2092.18s - 2097.00s |  So the whole idea was that if Motorola was not just selling you the processor,
2097.00s - 2101.32s |  that's what two of all these companies, they're selling you the complete set of
2101.32s - 2103.24s |  chips for your system.
2104.76s - 2108.13s |  Architecturally, this is what we look at.
2108.13s - 2112.93s |  We look at the inside with the with the registers, you see the 6800 versus the
2112.93s - 2113.85s |  6502.
2114.49s - 2117.73s |  The 6800 had two registers, they got rid of one.
2118.41s - 2119.81s |  But otherwise, they're pretty similar.
2119.81s - 2122.61s |  They have index registers and stack registers and so forth.
2122.61s - 2126.15s |  Those are all needed in time inside the chip to do the work that it does.
2126.87s - 2132.41s |  So then we have the 6502, which of course, you see it's a it looks just just the
2132.41s - 2135.29s |  same as if it's a four pin dip, as it's called.
2136.69s - 2142.17s |  It has only 55 instructions versus the 77 of the 6800.
2143.65s - 2147.13s |  So the funny thing is, I've actually read some stuff where people have complaint
2147.17s - 2154.41s |  have claimed, I don't know if that's true or not, is that the 6502 is a
2154.41s - 2160.63s |  6502 might be the first risk chip, because they reduce the instruction set.
2161.39s - 2164.63s |  I don't know who can make that determination.
2165.75s - 2167.27s |  But that's what they did.
2168.87s - 2172.51s |  The original cost for this chip was $25.
2173.23s - 2177.47s |  And one of the ways they were able to do this was not just that it was a reduced
2177.47s - 2181.15s |  design was they were able to improve manufacturing.
2181.53s - 2185.89s |  Now, as I understand it, and those of you who have more knowledge, you can you can
2186.61s - 2189.85s |  get with the actor and tell me I'm got this wrong.
2190.05s - 2195.25s |  But as I understand it, the chip yield at that time was pretty lousy, as in you'd
2195.25s - 2201.77s |  run a make a bunch of chips, and 70% of them were bad, i.e. had to throw them
2201.77s - 2207.01s |  away, which is why chips are so costly, because the yield was so poor.
2207.31s - 2211.75s |  But apparently someone that you know, one of the motor engineers that came to MOS had
2211.75s - 2216.11s |  worked out a way I don't know what it is, I'm sorry, I'm not an engineer in this
2216.11s - 2223.15s |  area, a way of fixing the chips after production, such that they had a good
2223.15s - 2229.39s |  yield going and suddenly going being 70% bad to like 30% bad.
2229.91s - 2232.67s |  And thus they were able to sell the chips a lot cheaper.
2233.13s - 2238.85s |  And it was because of this price, that a couple of guys by the name of Steve Jobs
2238.85s - 2243.37s |  and Steve Wozniak looked at this and go like, hey, this is the chip that we can
2243.37s - 2248.05s |  use to put together this little home computer we've been thinking about, which
2248.29s - 2251.49s |  if you don't know who those people are, those are the guys that created the Apple
2251.49s - 2253.29s |  one and the Apple two, and so forth.
2254.27s - 2261.99s |  So, so what have been the 6502 been used for a lot of stuff over and over in the
2261.99s - 2268.55s |  UK, they, you know, the acorn computers, the BBC micro was used it, the Apple one,
2268.55s - 2275.43s |  the two and the three, and all the variations used it, the Atari home game
2275.43s - 2281.39s |  systems, the Atari eight bit systems used it, Commodore used it for their that all
2281.45s - 2289.37s |  the pet models of vic 2064, and so forth, the Nintendo used it, others used it, and
2290.45s - 2294.41s |  Bender from Futurama, use the 6502.
2295.45s - 2300.97s |  So then, of course, as I said, the 65816 chip was used in the two GS and the super
2300.97s - 2301.49s |  NES.
2301.97s - 2306.25s |  And as I said, Western design is still making and selling these chips.
2306.31s - 2309.43s |  Yeah, that's all they do is they, as far as I know, that's pretty much what they
2309.43s - 2310.23s |  manufacture.
2310.39s - 2312.91s |  So clearly, people are using these for a lot of embedded system.
2312.95s - 2317.71s |  Sadly, I don't know, they don't even say specifically what they're being used for,
2317.71s - 2319.07s |  but it's got to be used heavily.
2319.95s - 2324.19s |  Another interesting computer is the Kim one, which was created by Chuck Peddle at
2324.19s - 2329.83s |  MOS, it was a way to, it was a single board pewter to kind of sell the 6502, it
2329.83s - 2331.51s |  was so cheap that people bought that.
2331.51s - 2335.05s |  Those are very collectible, I've never never seen one.
2335.25s - 2337.93s |  So I'm not even sure, I think they were probably about yay big.
2339.25s - 2346.45s |  And if it's not clear, that keypad is basically hexadecimal numbers, and some
2346.45s - 2347.17s |  other commands.
2347.17s - 2349.33s |  So no, it's not a typewriter keyboard.
2351.97s - 2355.57s |  I know that Commodore was still making these even though after they bought out.
2356.19s - 2359.91s |  I know that Commodore was still making these even though after they bought out
2361.35s - 2365.83s |  MOS, and then of course, some of the secondary sources were 652 made their
2365.83s - 2369.03s |  own the the sim one and the aim 65.
2369.31s - 2372.95s |  And then I found this kind of interesting slide, I thought was
2372.95s - 2375.99s |  interesting that showed all the different systems that the clones of it
2375.99s - 2380.63s |  that popped up, I actually brought one that I've been building that I need to
2380.63s - 2384.41s |  try to fix, which is, this is the power one.
2384.77s - 2389.53s |  So you can see it's pretty small, it's got a keypad, an LED, there's something
2389.53s - 2391.85s |  wrong with it, I got to try to figure out how to fix this.
2392.09s - 2396.01s |  But, you know, if you come to me, if you visit me at the hacker halt at the
2396.17s - 2399.49s |  hardware hacking village, you can take it, you can have a chance to take a look
2399.49s - 2400.37s |  at it and so forth.
2400.61s - 2401.61s |  That's why I brought it.
2402.83s - 2408.93s |  So programming, which is always so much fun, which is a semi language program,
2408.93s - 2412.15s |  which is either miserable or whatever.
2413.07s - 2415.87s |  I think most people have you've done programming, probably done high level
2415.87s - 2420.43s |  programming, I know I have, you know, C and basic and Pascal and so forth.
2421.39s - 2426.55s |  The way I look at it is these programs are written to make it easier for us to
2426.55s - 2431.35s |  put in put down our ideas into how a program should work.
2432.27s - 2437.75s |  But the thing is, is they have to be then converted into the language of the
2437.77s - 2441.73s |  machines, which is machine code, which is, you know, binary coding, and so
2441.73s - 2442.21s |  forth.
2443.21s - 2444.97s |  How good that is, is unknown.
2444.97s - 2449.49s |  That's why many people do still write a do a semi language programming because
2450.41s - 2453.73s |  they can, you know, get down to the nitty gritty of the hardware and actually
2453.73s - 2454.57s |  write to it.
2455.01s - 2457.01s |  Unfortunately, it's not really fun.
2457.33s - 2458.97s |  But people do write it.
2458.97s - 2463.91s |  I was actually surprised that if you visit no starch press here, they actually
2463.91s - 2467.89s |  have a book on arm, a semi language programming, and I think they also have
2467.89s - 2470.41s |  one for x86 programming.
2470.89s - 2475.37s |  So the thing is also with parameters, when we do these higher level languages,
2475.37s - 2479.29s |  there's things like, you know, an if then statement, you know, if this
2479.29s - 2483.33s |  condition has been met, then do this, if you get a for loop or a while loop, and
2483.33s - 2488.13s |  all that they don't, that doesn't exist in a semi languages, you do have things
2488.13s - 2494.23s |  like a compare command, like, hey, do these two things compare, which is
2494.23s - 2495.39s |  higher, which is lower.
2495.75s - 2500.01s |  But from that, then you have to build that logic of that if statement or the
2500.01s - 2501.35s |  for loop and this sort of stuff.
2501.71s - 2504.27s |  So it becomes a little bit more complex.
2506.55s - 2509.91s |  So this is what 6502 looks like.
2509.91s - 2511.83s |  And it's I guess, three letter coding.
2512.27s - 2516.51s |  And these are some of the ones in like, there's an ad with carry, there's the
2516.51s - 2522.29s |  compare, there's the load, the accumulator, that means you're grabbing a
2522.29s - 2526.01s |  number out of memory and pulling the accumulator so you can do math on it.
2527.61s - 2533.65s |  The 6502 has only two math, math commands, it can add, and it can
2533.65s - 2534.41s |  subtract.
2534.57s - 2535.53s |  And that's it.
2536.19s - 2540.89s |  If you want to do multiply and divide, you're going to have to use add and
2540.89s - 2541.85s |  subtract.
2542.55s - 2548.67s |  So, and of course, if you're have any sense, you're going to, you're going to
2548.67s - 2549.71s |  comment your code.
2549.71s - 2552.95s |  Otherwise, we were going to look at your semi language, your semi coding, like, I
2552.95s - 2554.23s |  don't know what the hell you're doing here.
2555.27s - 2560.27s |  If you would like to try out 6502 semi language, I found this really cool
2560.27s - 2562.55s |  website, it uses JavaScript.
2562.55s - 2565.35s |  So you can actually do a semi language programming there.
2565.55s - 2568.61s |  And it's both not it's not just it's not just like, oh, here's a window to do a
2568.61s - 2569.19s |  semi language.
2569.43s - 2573.23s |  It is done as a tutorial, where you can go on there and you can write, you know,
2573.23s - 2575.63s |  put in the code, you can see what happens and so forth.
2575.99s - 2578.79s |  And also to serve with this other one, which is an online tutorial.
2579.35s - 2581.43s |  Yeah, feel free to take pictures of these.
2582.03s - 2582.79s |  These are really good.
2583.13s - 2585.35s |  So this is what a semi language looks like.
2587.67s - 2590.99s |  The left side is a semi language to do a bubble sort.
2591.51s - 2596.63s |  And then on the right side is bubble sort in thing C.
2598.63s - 2603.55s |  So that looks like really, really fun things to write, which is probably why I
2603.55s - 2608.55s |  don't recall doing a whole lot of out of a semi language even in college, really
2608.55s - 2609.15s |  simple stuff.
2609.87s - 2614.87s |  Okay, this is the point where I would recommend you might want to pull your
2614.87s - 2618.03s |  phones out, because I'm going to be giving a lot of resources, you are
2618.03s - 2619.79s |  totally free to take pictures.
2619.79s - 2621.11s |  That's why I do this.
2621.83s - 2627.35s |  I'm always the mind of I'm here to help educate you and show you where you can go
2627.35s - 2628.59s |  next after this.
2629.51s - 2636.67s |  So websites, right at the top 6502.org is like the place for anything about this.
2636.71s - 2642.95s |  The 6502, there's Buku resources, emulators, software sources, hardware,
2643.27s - 2645.31s |  tutorials, and everything like that.
2645.59s - 2649.51s |  The other one is a neat one that I discovered, they have a lot of pages on
2649.51s - 2655.11s |  the 6502, and so forth, and a lot on the Kim one, including PDF scans of a lot of
2655.11s - 2658.15s |  the documentation, which I thought was really, really cool.
2659.59s - 2661.79s |  The last one is the Internet Archive.
2662.43s - 2666.59s |  If you are interested in looking for books, and you can't find them, or they're
2666.59s - 2671.11s |  really, really expensive, try going there and searching, you can probably find
2671.11s - 2673.13s |  them as PDF scan.
2673.13s - 2676.43s |  So all the books I talked about, you can probably find them there if you don't
2676.43s - 2676.87s |  want them.
2677.07s - 2680.07s |  Me, I want physical books.
2680.11s - 2681.23s |  That's, that's just me.
2681.41s - 2688.19s |  So, so I'm not sure if you guys familiar with Adam Osborne, the Osborne
2688.19s - 2692.29s |  computer, but one of the things that I liked about him is he had his own
2692.29s - 2697.41s |  publishing company, which then became part of McGraw Hill as Osborne McGraw
2697.41s - 2701.53s |  Hill, and it was one of my favorite sources for books.
2701.73s - 2705.29s |  So he did a series called an introduction to microcomputers.
2705.29s - 2712.61s |  I had four volumes numbered zero through three, but I only recommend you look at
2712.61s - 2713.69s |  getting the first two.
2714.67s - 2719.39s |  You can get them really inexpensive off of like Amazon and eBay, make sure you
2719.39s - 2721.07s |  get the last edition.
2721.07s - 2723.27s |  But those are really, really good introduction to this.
2725.47s - 2729.55s |  I don't have volume two and three, they go for the people ask for stupid money
2729.55s - 2730.71s |  for it, and I'm like, sorry.
2731.03s - 2736.87s |  But if you really are into into the hardware of microprocessors, the last two
2736.87s - 2739.19s |  books you might want to get, I actually got them.
2739.63s - 2742.07s |  They're literally about two inches thick.
2742.29s - 2744.65s |  It's not they're not going to tell you how to program these, but they're going
2744.65s - 2748.77s |  to tell you about all the electronics and the hardware of these processor night.
2748.97s - 2750.53s |  To me, that was like really, really cool.
2750.81s - 2753.21s |  But I'm a nerd.
2753.21s - 2755.49s |  So what can you say?
2757.48s - 2761.90s |  When it comes to a semi language program, one of my two authors is Lance
2761.90s - 2766.78s |  Leventhal, who did all these things through Osborne McGraw Hill.
2767.54s - 2770.18s |  He did the 65021, which had a second edition.
2770.18s - 2771.42s |  That's that's what it looks like.
2771.72s - 2775.24s |  He also did an assembly language subroutine series, which I was not aware
2775.24s - 2778.64s |  of, but I got the 65021 recently.
2779.04s - 2783.42s |  The 68000, I know I used that in college, but he did others.
2783.42s - 2794.04s |  He did a 6800, a 6809, the Z8000, the 8085, and so forth, as well as assembly
2794.04s - 2796.40s |  language subroutines for some of these, these ones.
2797.02s - 2800.78s |  Please be advised that people are asking stupid money for these.
2800.78s - 2808.86s |  But if you go on lulu.com, someone has made available his Z80 and the first
2808.86s - 2811.64s |  edition of the 6502 book there on Lulu.
2811.90s - 2815.62s |  And I think they cost about 20 bucks or 30.
2815.70s - 2817.30s |  Yeah, I think about 20 bucks or 30 bucks.
2817.58s - 2820.30s |  So if you don't want to buy a used copy, go there.
2821.00s - 2826.06s |  The other guy is Rodney Zaks, who founded Cybex Books, which is still
2826.06s - 2828.12s |  around, but as an imprint of Wiley.
2828.52s - 2832.32s |  He did actually a four book series on the 6502.
2832.92s - 2836.36s |  I know I used his 6502 book in college.
2836.60s - 2839.84s |  The last one is the fourth edition with that really cool cover.
2840.12s - 2841.92s |  I have most of the series.
2841.92s - 2844.90s |  I'm trying to get the, I'm trying to find the application book, but I want that
2844.90s - 2849.48s |  cover, but his other, he's got a really great Z80 book that I want to get.
2849.48s - 2852.06s |  Again, I'm not going to pay the stupid money people are asking for.
2853.22s - 2855.46s |  But he's another good one.
2855.90s - 2864.94s |  I found on Tindy that someone had reprinted the, these MOS books on the
2864.94s - 2868.94s |  Kim one, I actually brought one of them with me that you guys can take a look
2868.94s - 2874.68s |  at, I got the user manual, but he had these on Tindy, he might be running out.
2874.98s - 2877.62s |  So if you want them, get them while the getting's good.
2877.76s - 2882.24s |  Other books are these on the 65816.
2882.56s - 2885.28s |  I've had the Osborne one, but I've never done programming.
2885.44s - 2890.52s |  The last one was actually from Brady, but now Western Design has reprinted it.
2890.52s - 2893.56s |  So you can easily get it off of Amazon.
2894.60s - 2898.96s |  But I've had people, I've read stuff that people don't think it's that
2898.96s - 2900.44s |  good of a book for a semi-language program.
2900.44s - 2902.68s |  So just be, be aware.
2903.28s - 2905.48s |  I have not got it myself, so I cannot speak.
2905.94s - 2909.22s |  So you want to actually play around and program with these.
2909.22s - 2910.50s |  Well, you have various options.
2910.50s - 2912.34s |  It's kind of depending on what you want.
2913.46s - 2916.90s |  Do you want hardware or are you happy with software or something in between?
2917.18s - 2918.78s |  That, that's, that's up to you.
2920.14s - 2923.58s |  There are many communities of fans that still keep these things to going and
2923.58s - 2925.02s |  they're actually creating new stuff.
2926.66s - 2929.50s |  I can actually have wifi on my Atari 8 bits.
2929.50s - 2934.90s |  I'm, I can have, I can use compact flash and SD cards for storage because
2934.90s - 2936.72s |  of the work that these people have done.
2937.04s - 2940.48s |  So if you want, you can go get the classic 8 bit, you can go on the
2940.48s - 2945.80s |  eBay and take a look, just be aware that sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.
2945.82s - 2947.20s |  Most of the buyers are pretty honest.
2947.20s - 2948.56s |  They'll say like, no, this doesn't work.
2948.80s - 2950.40s |  You're getting this for parts or whatever.
2950.64s - 2952.84s |  You might need to do some retrobriting, which is to clean
2952.84s - 2954.32s |  up the coloring and so forth.
2954.64s - 2964.56s |  But I've gotten an 800, a 1200 XL and a 130 XE off of eBay for what I
2964.58s - 2966.42s |  thought was reasonable, reasonable prices.
2967.62s - 2970.18s |  So just, just be aware.
2971.50s - 2974.58s |  If you want brand new, check out this.
2976.14s - 2978.78s |  This is an effort of a guy by the name was the 8 bit guy.
2979.14s - 2982.86s |  It's a brand new 65, 65 or two base system.
2983.22s - 2986.34s |  They are currently making and selling developer systems.
2986.34s - 2988.62s |  They cost about 300 bucks.
2989.30s - 2991.94s |  They're still having people developing software and so forth.
2992.24s - 2995.88s |  So, but it looks, it's a, I think it's kind of a cool, cool project.
2995.88s - 2996.88s |  So take a look at it.
2997.68s - 3000.08s |  Like I said, you can do chem one clones.
3000.08s - 3002.16s |  Like I said, this, this is a chem one clone.
3002.48s - 3006.00s |  I got this off of Tendy and you can have, and I got the extra stuff.
3006.00s - 3008.20s |  I'm trying to like get this thing to work and so forth.
3008.20s - 3013.52s |  So if you want different, there's all other, if you go into Tendy and just
3013.52s - 3016.60s |  search, let's search for 65 two, you can find out there's the Pico
3016.60s - 3018.68s |  computer actually brought mine with me.
3018.92s - 3020.48s |  I still got to get that working.
3020.74s - 3022.54s |  The Roscoe is kind of interesting.
3022.54s - 3025.38s |  It's real old school computer.
3025.38s - 3028.38s |  That's what it, what's it, what it stands for, or you can do the other one, but
3028.38s - 3029.78s |  there's others that are there on Tendy.
3029.78s - 3033.30s |  If you know, it's like what you want, do you want to, you want a computer where
3033.54s - 3036.98s |  you're going to have to basically hook it to your laptop and send it code and
3036.98s - 3040.14s |  whatnot, or do you want one that's more of a standalone computer with a, with
3040.14s - 3044.46s |  a keyboard and screen, you know, there's different options if you don't want
3044.46s - 3046.58s |  that, you can go hardware alternatives.
3046.58s - 3050.68s |  One is emulation through what's called field programmable gate array.
3051.00s - 3052.32s |  Look into the Mr.
3052.32s - 3059.32s |  Project where people are emulating all kinds of retro computers in that, in
3059.32s - 3060.48s |  this, what have Mr.
3060.48s - 3061.08s |  System.
3061.56s - 3065.44s |  You might've seen the various minis that have been hit in the market.
3065.48s - 3070.92s |  There has been the Atari 400 mini and the Atari 2600 and the Commodore mini
3070.92s - 3075.64s |  and the Amiga mini and the Nintendo mini and the Sega mini, and I'm probably
3075.66s - 3078.94s |  missing some, but, and they're all done with FPGA.
3079.58s - 3084.86s |  Then there's this interesting one, which is the mega 65 from Germany, which they
3084.86s - 3089.50s |  have basically recreated what would have been Commodore's last eight bit system
3089.50s - 3090.74s |  using FPGA.
3091.10s - 3095.26s |  I thought about getting it until I looked at the price and it's like, not yet.
3095.46s - 3098.50s |  So, and if you want, if you just, if you're not going to, you just want
3098.50s - 3102.22s |  software emulation again, check out the 6502 or for that.
3102.72s - 3103.08s |  Videos.
3103.08s - 3104.56s |  There's a lot of cool videos out there.
3104.88s - 3107.08s |  What the eight bit guy is a neat guy.
3107.08s - 3111.88s |  He's the guy that behind the commander X 16 low spec gamer has some neat videos.
3111.88s - 3113.80s |  The first one is on the 6502.
3114.12s - 3118.12s |  He did one of the Z80 recommend you look up his one on the arm.
3118.64s - 3124.80s |  You will then learn why you, you have the 6502 to thank for the, for, for arm
3124.80s - 3125.60s |  processors.
3125.60s - 3130.54s |  So, and also look for videos with Chuck Peddle, Bill Minch, Rodney Zaks, and
3130.54s - 3131.46s |  all these other guys.
3131.70s - 3132.62s |  They're really, really cool.
3132.90s - 3134.18s |  You want events and groups.
3134.18s - 3138.66s |  There's the vintage computer Federation, and I was really shocked that they have
3138.66s - 3144.26s |  these all around the country as well as overseas and look for groups in your
3144.26s - 3146.66s |  area that are into retro computing.
3147.86s - 3150.34s |  So if you want to contact me, that's my Twitter handle.
3150.34s - 3153.46s |  I am, I am at retrocomputing.com.
3153.72s - 3154.72s |  That's my Twitter handle.
3154.72s - 3160.36s |  I am, I am on the DEF CON discord as well as as one for the makers community.
3160.60s - 3162.56s |  So if you want to reach out to me, that's great.
3162.84s - 3163.88s |  That's my LinkedIn.
3164.24s - 3171.16s |  I would recommend you, there's a retro tech community over there, someplace
3171.16s - 3172.36s |  that you can drop by then.
3172.66s - 3173.52s |  I was disappointed.
3173.52s - 3174.80s |  They had no Atari stuff.
3174.80s - 3175.32s |  I'm sorry.
3175.32s - 3178.64s |  I'm an Atari and, and there's also the hardware hacking village.
3178.84s - 3180.80s |  After this, I'm going to head over to the hardware hacking village.
3181.02s - 3183.74s |  I'll have a few of my things with me.
3184.02s - 3186.34s |  You want to talk with me and tell me I'm an idiot.
3186.38s - 3189.74s |  I don't know what the hell I'm talking about and I shouldn't have been here or
3189.74s - 3192.38s |  what have you, or you have questions and comments and whatnot.
3193.18s - 3197.34s |  I'm happy to hang out there and you can see, you can, I'll even let you touch my
3197.34s - 3197.84s |  stuff.
3198.06s - 3201.02s |  So thank you very much.
3201.14s - 3204.22s |  And I will see you all later.
