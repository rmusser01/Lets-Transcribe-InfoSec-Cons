**Introduction to Binary Exploitation**
- **Binary exploitation** has been a significant challenge in the last 20+ years.
- Concerns over **memory safety** and **corruption issues** in low-level languages.
- Transition to **safer languages** like Rust is ongoing but needs maturity.
- **Exploit mitigations** like DEP, ASLR, CET, and VBS have reduced vulnerabilities.

**Stephen Sims' Background**
- **Vulnerability researcher** with over 20 years of experience.
- Sold 29 **browser exploits** and discovered several **kernel vulnerabilities**.
- Co-author of **Grey Hat Hacking** and runs **Off By One Security** stream.

**Agenda Overview**
- History of **mitigations** and current state.
- Insight into **payouts** for vulnerabilities.
- Role of **machine learning and AI** in vulnerability research.
- Technical dive into specific mitigations and debugging techniques.

**History and Impact of Mitigations**
- **Golden years** of hacking were before effective mitigations.
- **Windows and Linux** adopted mitigations at different times.
- **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)** and **stack canaries** are notable.
- Mitigations are not foolproof and require **complementary** approaches.
- **Cat and mouse game** between exploit techniques and mitigations.

**Payouts for Vulnerabilities**
- Various categories of **buyers** from vendors to intelligence agencies.
- Ethical considerations in **selling exploits**.
- **Exploitation companies** like Zerodium and CrowdFence offer high payouts.
- **Unethical market** exists for selling exploits through anonymous channels.

**Machine Learning in Vulnerability Research**
- **AI and automation** can complement vulnerability research.
- **Project Zero** and other initiatives explore AI's role in finding bugs.
- **Complex bug classes** like type confusion are challenging for AI.
- Transition to **Rust** is seen as a long-term solution.

**Technical Dive into Mitigations**
- Example of **create process** mitigation in Windows.
- **Kernel enforced** vs. **user land enforced** mitigations.
- Importance of understanding **mitigation mechanics** for effective defense.
- **Debugging and reverse engineering** techniques to evaluate mitigations.

**Takeaways and Future Outlook**
- **Binary exploitation** will persist as long as vulnerabilities exist.
- Mitigations are essential but not invincible.
- **Ethical considerations** in research and exploitation are crucial.
- **AI** will not replace human researchers soon due to nuances in research.
