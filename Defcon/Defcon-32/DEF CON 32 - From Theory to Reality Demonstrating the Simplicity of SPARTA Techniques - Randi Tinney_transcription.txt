 Hello, I'm Randy Tinney.
1.68s - 4.38s |  I represent the Aerospace Corporation.
4.38s - 8.38s |  And today I'm going to be talking about SPARTA techniques and how easy they are.
10.04s - 17.34s |  If I can get my slide deck working, there we go.
18.04s - 19.10s |  So a little bit about me.
19.10s - 22.90s |  I first got into this industry back in 2018.
22.94s - 26.28s |  I was hired on as a contractor at NASA's Independent Verification
26.28s - 27.78s |  and Validation Center.
27.78s - 31.22s |  In 2022, I was hired on at the Aerospace Corporation,
31.22s - 34.12s |  kind of as a jack of all trades, let's say.
34.32s - 37.46s |  I do a little bit of everything, the exploit developer, vulnerability
37.46s - 42.00s |  researcher, website developer, because I am the main developer
42.00s - 47.24s |  for the Space Attack Research and Tactic Analysis Framework, also known as SPARTA.
48.64s - 53.50s |  And then finally, my last kind of name to fame is last year
53.74s - 57.62s |  I was part of the team that won the Red Alert ICS CTF,
57.92s - 59.64s |  where we got a black badge.
59.64s - 62.74s |  So that's pretty, pretty exciting.
62.74s - 64.90s |  So let's kind of back up and talk about SPARTA.
65.40s - 69.58s |  In case anybody didn't know about SPARTA, SPARTA is a cybersecurity framework
69.58s - 72.42s |  that we launched back in October of 2022.
72.84s - 75.36s |  We're actually coming up on our second year anniversary,
75.72s - 82.40s |  and it is a cybersecurity matrix that mainly focuses on spacecraft
82.40s - 84.16s |  and space related systems.
84.16s - 87.40s |  It's very similar to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework,
87.40s - 94.54s |  where it looks at all of the threats, tactics, techniques and procedures.
94.70s - 97.54s |  Only this one focuses on the space systems,
97.54s - 100.70s |  while MITRE ATT&CK focuses on more on the ground side of things.
101.18s - 104.68s |  And really, we built this tool for both the commercial
104.68s - 108.68s |  and the government users to mainly stay up to date
108.94s - 111.92s |  for the various attacks that may threaten their field.
112.28s - 115.16s |  And it's really gotten a lot of attention
115.18s - 117.98s |  from the industry itself.
117.98s - 119.62s |  We've had a lot of good feedback,
119.62s - 123.30s |  and it's really grown thanks to the contributions that everybody's done.
124.30s - 127.40s |  Unfortunately, because everything is kind of unclassified,
127.40s - 132.00s |  a lot of the, let's say, attacks that we've talked about
132.00s - 134.64s |  are more from a tabletop perspective.
135.44s - 139.34s |  We can't really give any kind of actual attacks that have occurred.
139.34s - 141.34s |  Nobody wants to reveal that information.
141.34s - 143.64s |  And so a lot of people that are just getting into this industry
143.66s - 145.76s |  don't know what they look like.
145.76s - 148.40s |  They don't know where they can be detected.
148.40s - 150.76s |  They don't know how to really block them.
151.10s - 155.50s |  And so that's another reason why I did the research that I did
155.74s - 160.34s |  in order to actually do these attacks in a simulated environment
160.34s - 164.68s |  to help people see where things are going to be detected
164.68s - 166.08s |  and how they actually look like.
167.02s - 169.32s |  To do this, though, I need to kind of take a step back
169.84s - 176.18s |  and really look at how a spacecraft, how we can communicate with it.
176.62s - 179.18s |  And so I'm a very simple person.
179.78s - 183.22s |  So I designed this very simple image.
183.88s - 186.72s |  And really, the idea is, you know, you have a person behind a computer.
186.72s - 188.60s |  We call that command and control server.
188.60s - 191.60s |  And they're pressing buttons, sending commands up to the spacecraft.
192.46s - 195.70s |  That command will then flow over to the front end processor,
195.90s - 197.66s |  which then travels to a modem.
197.68s - 202.48s |  Now, sometimes, not always a mission or a operation
202.48s - 205.12s |  will have a encryptor or authenticator.
205.28s - 206.92s |  We call that the bulk crypto unit.
206.92s - 210.26s |  Usually it's placed between the front end processor and your modem.
210.26s - 213.96s |  So right before those packets are transferred to the RF signal.
214.56s - 215.66s |  This is not always the case.
215.66s - 219.20s |  We are encouraging that more often, but still, it's a it's a slow thing
219.20s - 221.00s |  that can be included.
221.00s - 224.00s |  But anyways, after it either goes through the bulk crypto unit
224.00s - 226.64s |  or it doesn't exist, it goes to the modem, gets transferred
226.66s - 230.86s |  to the RF signal, to the ground satellite, up to the spacecraft.
231.32s - 234.46s |  And there we go. Same with telemetry.
234.60s - 237.26s |  It just comes back the in the reverse direction.
238.50s - 241.44s |  And then, of course, I added this little feature where you can see
241.60s - 245.64s |  where it goes from human readable to spacecraft communication
245.64s - 247.98s |  to the RF signal.
247.98s - 253.18s |  So knowing this and seeing this very simplified manner,
253.22s - 257.46s |  I immediately thought about where could the best method of attack
257.46s - 259.36s |  be for this system?
259.36s - 262.76s |  Because a lot of the people in the space industry think that their systems
262.76s - 264.30s |  are untouchable just because they're in space.
264.30s - 268.30s |  They're, you know, high above Earth, hard to talk to.
268.30s - 270.84s |  Radio frequency is hard to decode.
270.84s - 275.20s |  So in my mind, the most logical attack vector was
275.80s - 279.52s |  to the left of that bulk crypto unit or the modem if it doesn't exist.
279.52s - 282.48s |  And really focusing on either the person itself
283.28s - 286.12s |  the command and control server or the front end processor
286.28s - 288.78s |  or any combination of the between.
288.78s - 292.42s |  So the idea is you're going to be actually compromising
292.42s - 295.52s |  that ground station in some way and attacking at that point.
296.96s - 299.30s |  Now, unfortunately, because I've been on a lot of missions
299.90s - 303.90s |  as a cyber assessor, I've heard a lot of excuses of why this won't work.
304.26s - 307.58s |  Actually, people do not like it whenever you say that their mission
307.58s - 309.44s |  operation center could be compromised.
309.46s - 311.50s |  They think because they have a lot of,
311.50s - 314.74s |  you know, guns, guards with guns,
315.74s - 318.82s |  you know, different fences with barbed wires, that they're untouchable.
319.78s - 322.32s |  In fact, they really don't even like
322.72s - 326.02s |  acknowledging that there could be a breach in their system.
326.26s - 328.78s |  And they come up with a ton of different excuses.
329.46s - 332.56s |  Some of my favorites are, you know, we got a lot of firewalls.
333.20s - 334.56s |  They're not going to get past that.
334.56s - 336.84s |  Obviously, everybody knows that's the case.
337.74s - 338.66s |  We're air gapped.
338.66s - 342.94s |  Our systems don't even touch the network at all. OK.
344.14s - 347.54s |  And then they also say that we just accept that risk of insider threat.
347.58s - 349.44s |  You know, the guy behind the command and control server,
349.44s - 352.48s |  he may send a bad command, but we've got mitigations.
353.32s - 354.32s |  Not always the case.
354.32s - 357.46s |  And we we show them that, unfortunately, just
358.08s - 362.02s |  it's a lot easier to assume that at any point in time, you're
362.36s - 364.20s |  you're going to get you're going to have a breach.
364.20s - 365.72s |  You're going to be attacked in some manner.
365.74s - 368.84s |  It doesn't matter how there's always going to be a vulnerability available.
368.84s - 372.18s |  So if you assume that that is a possibility, you'll be more likely to patch it.
372.34s - 373.92s |  We definitely promote defense in depth.
373.92s - 375.68s |  And that's where this comes from.
375.68s - 379.82s |  So whenever I say that we are assuming that our initial access vector
379.82s - 383.66s |  is the compromised ground system, I am referring to the actual Sparta
383.66s - 387.12s |  TTP that we've created of the compromised ground system.
387.40s - 391.06s |  And this is one of the ones that has the highest notional risk score as well.
391.30s - 394.04s |  So we definitely take this very seriously.
394.06s - 396.62s |  And we're saying, like, this is going to happen.
396.92s - 399.32s |  So just assume it, accept it and be done.
400.42s - 403.44s |  And like I said earlier, I'm a very simple person.
403.56s - 405.90s |  So my attack that I did was very simple.
406.40s - 409.08s |  In fact, it's so simple that I just did a man in the middle
409.68s - 411.90s |  to prove that all of these attacks can be done.
412.38s - 416.08s |  Specifically, I do an ARP spoof between the command and control server
416.08s - 418.04s |  and the front end processor.
418.04s - 421.48s |  Now, once again, I kind of feel what you all are seeing are saying.
422.32s - 425.92s |  Now, nobody's going to do an ARP spoof on a very complex system.
426.16s - 428.66s |  This is too hard. That's script kitty stuff.
429.72s - 434.54s |  Well, a couple of weeks back, we were actually at a training event
434.90s - 438.24s |  where we were testing some things and we did these attacks
438.78s - 442.68s |  and they couldn't detect us because they also thought they were too simple.
443.34s - 447.84s |  So even in these complex systems, please don't overlook the simple stuff
447.94s - 451.74s |  like script kitties exist and they will try to attack you at all times.
452.12s - 453.28s |  So that's what I'm saying.
453.28s - 456.68s |  And that's what I've done for this entire presentation.
456.92s - 459.72s |  So I created a tool that was just a very simple man in the middle.
460.42s - 464.66s |  I called it the Sparta Cyber Exploiter just because, you know, I like the acronyms.
465.20s - 468.70s |  I'm not here to promote the tool because I will tell you the tool itself
468.70s - 473.16s |  is a Python Flask server running SCAPI and the Netfilter queue.
473.50s - 476.44s |  So you too can create your own space invader if you wish.
476.54s - 477.14s |  Very simple.
477.14s - 481.04s |  You just have to know what those three things are and some CCSDS decoding.
482.58s - 485.58s |  So let's talk about the actual environment because these are the attacks.
485.58s - 487.52s |  You can read what the attacks are going to do later.
487.52s - 491.36s |  But the actual environment we're going to be attacking is NASA's open source
491.36s - 494.30s |  NOSCube. You can go to GitHub. I've included the link here.
494.30s - 496.42s |  It's a very, very awesome tool
496.42s - 499.50s |  if you want to play with a realistic spacecraft system
499.66s - 502.20s |  and you're going to see how realistic it is in these demos.
502.80s - 505.96s |  All right, so let's go actually start talking about some TTPs.
507.24s - 510.54s |  The very first one is just exfiltrating telemetry and command.
511.38s - 515.58s |  This one really is kind of overlooked because once again, it's just packets.
515.58s - 516.68s |  Nobody knows what to do with them.
516.68s - 518.42s |  Actually, this is kind of pretty serious.
518.42s - 520.72s |  You're going to see why in a little bit.
520.72s - 523.92s |  Everything that you see here will actually be used in future attacks.
524.68s - 527.98s |  I will not force you to decode CCSDS.
527.98s - 530.52s |  Just know that if it starts with a zero, it's a telemetry.
530.54s - 532.54s |  If it starts with a one, it's a command.
532.54s - 534.08s |  OK, very simple.
534.08s - 536.32s |  And this is all done just because we're man in the middle,
536.32s - 539.38s |  not doing anything special, just printing out those packets to the screen.
540.12s - 544.34s |  So the second attack that we're going to do is actually falsifying
544.34s - 546.58s |  the telemetry that's downlinked.
546.58s - 549.44s |  In a mission operations center, the telemetry is probably
549.44s - 552.42s |  the most important information that a person can get
552.42s - 556.42s |  because that tells them the health and status of their spacecraft.
556.42s - 559.98s |  So what we're going to do is we're going to degrade that confidence
560.20s - 563.34s |  and we're going to do that by manipulating packets.
564.34s - 567.68s |  So I have a video here where we've captured a telemetry packet
567.68s - 571.34s |  and we're actually going to change every telemetry that has a specific API
571.34s - 575.62s |  or application ID so that the ground station is going to see
575.62s - 578.96s |  what we want them to see and they're just going to start communicating.
578.96s - 582.02s |  So here I'm sending a bunch of no op commands to a camera.
582.02s - 583.72s |  No op stands for no operation.
583.72s - 586.36s |  And really, that's just going to send the command counter up.
586.36s - 589.26s |  But since we're falsifying telemetry, they don't know
589.48s - 591.68s |  they don't see that information at all.
592.48s - 597.16s |  So they are probably thinking, oh, we've lost complete control of our spacecraft
597.16s - 599.82s |  or our flight application isn't working.
599.82s - 603.76s |  However, after we stop the command, you will see that command counter
604.36s - 608.40s |  go up by like, you know, a lot since I sent a bunch of commands.
609.20s - 613.54s |  So, yeah, that's an immediate degrade of confidence level in your ground system,
613.54s - 616.28s |  which is kind of terrifying in my mind.
617.88s - 619.14s |  The next one is very similar.
619.16s - 621.20s |  We're modifying the packets on the fly.
621.60s - 625.40s |  So in this example, we're taking a very specific
625.40s - 629.80s |  or we're watching for a very specific command and we're changing it to something else.
630.34s - 633.74s |  In this example, we're going to be modifying the camera
633.74s - 639.14s |  no op just to the executive services no op, just to show and demonstrate what this does.
639.88s - 642.08s |  But this can actually be pretty dangerous.
642.08s - 645.66s |  You know, let's say you captured a command that was changing a registry key
645.66s - 648.22s |  on the system and you sent that off
648.24s - 652.08s |  and you wanted to block the ground station from, you know, changing it back.
652.98s - 656.18s |  This is a specific way in which to do that, where it's going to block
656.18s - 661.18s |  every attempt to change it with very little effort on your part.
664.58s - 668.38s |  Yeah, so we just send those commands just to show that they sent and then we come back.
669.38s - 670.82s |  The next one is super easy.
670.82s - 672.38s |  It's jamming your man in the middle.
672.38s - 674.16s |  Just block the packets.
674.16s - 679.40s |  Once again, this stops the this degrades the confidence in your downlinked telemetry
679.66s - 682.16s |  and it can also stop any commands from going up.
682.16s - 684.52s |  So once again, if you've attacked the spacecraft in any way,
684.52s - 687.76s |  you can just stop them from communicating entirely.
688.76s - 694.30s |  In this case, all you need to know is the whatever important IP you want to block.
694.44s - 698.44s |  In this case, we're blocking the command and control server and the telemetry downlink.
698.94s - 701.94s |  And yeah, telemetry is not going.
701.94s - 705.04s |  And then whenever we stop it, it's going back.
705.38s - 709.28s |  So once again, it's it's a very simplistic attack.
709.30s - 712.80s |  But it's detrimental to the mission operation center.
715.08s - 719.94s |  And the other way on the other spectrum of that is flooding attack flooding.
719.94s - 725.82s |  You're just sending a bunch of information to whatever port you want in this case.
725.82s - 729.28s |  And just for a visual effect, I send it to the telemetry
729.28s - 731.72s |  just so you can see what information's there.
732.28s - 735.56s |  There's actually two different flooding attacks that we follow in Sparta.
735.72s - 738.56s |  One is the valid commands and the other one's just random data.
738.58s - 740.62s |  I'm going to be showing the random data one just to show
740.62s - 744.42s |  like how you can degrade confidence in that ground station again.
745.56s - 748.78s |  And as you can see, it's just complete chaos on the ground station itself.
750.32s - 754.90s |  The idea of this, though, is that you want to basically block all communications.
755.66s - 759.54s |  You could also send a bunch of random data up to the satellite.
759.74s - 763.30s |  The only reason I didn't do that here is because due to the simulation,
763.30s - 765.20s |  it has to be pretty beefy.
765.22s - 769.12s |  Thanks to the 42 simulator, which we're going to talk about in a little bit.
769.76s - 773.12s |  So really, it didn't show any kind of good visual effects.
773.86s - 775.30s |  But yeah, you could totally do that.
775.30s - 776.40s |  And if you send it up to the bird,
776.40s - 780.40s |  you could do everything from locking it up or crashing it, really.
783.29s - 785.95s |  Oh, skip too far ahead.
785.95s - 789.55s |  All right. So this is probably one of my favorite ones that we're going to do.
789.55s - 790.69s |  It's the road ground station.
790.69s - 792.59s |  You do not have to be man in the middle for this.
792.59s - 794.53s |  In fact, this one's probably even more dangerous.
794.53s - 796.59s |  It's another initial access vector,
796.59s - 799.27s |  which with a very high notional risk score.
799.67s - 803.13s |  The only thing you really need to know is what IP and port
803.13s - 805.53s |  the front end processor is talking on.
805.53s - 807.83s |  A lot of front end processors that I've looked at
807.83s - 811.93s |  does not have any kind of authentication enabled to talk to that port.
812.09s - 815.53s |  So you can send whatever data you want.
816.13s - 819.13s |  I'm just doing it in this tool just because I like everything.
819.13s - 823.49s |  Once again, simple together in a nice GUI for visual effect.
823.57s - 825.13s |  That's the only reason it's here.
825.13s - 827.97s |  Now for the road ground station, you actually need to have
827.97s - 830.71s |  the command and control server or command and control database,
831.13s - 834.57s |  or you need to be having captured packets like in the man in the middle.
835.01s - 838.77s |  In this case, as a good hacker, I have had the command and control database
838.77s - 840.73s |  and I'm going to upload that to my system.
842.21s - 844.77s |  Command and control database is probably crown jewels of your,
845.27s - 846.67s |  you know, operation.
846.67s - 852.23s |  If some for some reason it gets leaked or it's, you know, captured.
853.11s - 856.37s |  Yeah, your system's done if they can figure out how to decode it.
857.01s - 859.41s |  In this case, I upload it. I know how to do everything.
859.97s - 863.21s |  I send it to that front end processor and I just send it a bunch of commands
863.21s - 864.93s |  just to make sure that it works.
864.93s - 867.57s |  In this case, just no ops, you know, not really care.
867.57s - 870.17s |  And just to see just to show that I have access to it.
870.53s - 873.81s |  But I thought it would be really cool if we combine some attacks.
874.03s - 876.43s |  So I'm going to work with the reaction wheel.
876.43s - 880.43s |  Now, the reaction wheel on a spacecraft is how it turns in space
880.43s - 882.21s |  to point to where it needs to go.
882.59s - 885.41s |  So I thought it'd be fun if we, you know, activated one.
886.05s - 889.19s |  But I'm actually going to combine this with an attack previously
889.19s - 891.65s |  where we were changing the telemetry down.
892.01s - 895.51s |  So I captured a telemetry packet that we had
895.51s - 898.31s |  and I go back to my changing packet attack.
898.69s - 900.71s |  I'm just going to change it to whatever that is.
900.71s - 904.81s |  So, you know, the ground operations doesn't know that I'm doing anything.
905.25s - 908.75s |  Launch the attack. Go back to my road ground station.
909.69s - 912.49s |  I really don't care, you know, what wheel I use.
912.79s - 914.85s |  So this is the 42 server, by the way.
914.85s - 916.35s |  This is what makes it so beefy.
916.35s - 920.75s |  This CubeSat will actually rotate around Earth and spin, which is really nice.
920.75s - 923.85s |  And that's another reason why this NOSCube simulator is pretty awesome.
925.15s - 927.49s |  It'll spin with every tick, so you'll actually see it.
928.05s - 929.65s |  So, yeah, with the reaction wheel, I don't care.
929.65s - 932.53s |  I'm just going to set the torque to 10 and let it fly.
934.15s - 936.75s |  So every tick in the 42 server,
936.75s - 939.05s |  it actually, you know, flops along.
939.23s - 942.53s |  So eventually you'll start seeing that CubeSat
943.15s - 946.33s |  rotate on that wheel as it's been activated.
946.49s - 949.05s |  And of course, the ground operators, they're not aware.
949.15s - 950.63s |  I'm completely blocking them.
950.63s - 951.53s |  They have no clue.
952.89s - 955.35s |  And yeah, so they think everything's fine and dandy.
956.49s - 957.49s |  Pretty awesome.
957.49s - 961.75s |  Now, they would see it if I went back into my, you know, my ground station
961.75s - 964.59s |  and I stopped that attack, which I'll go ahead and do just to show you
964.83s - 966.63s |  what that would look like.
967.79s - 971.13s |  And if you look over on the Cosmos packet,
971.29s - 974.63s |  you actually see that wheel zero start to change.
974.63s - 977.29s |  And that's how you're going to see that the reaction wheel is changing.
977.67s - 980.17s |  But once again, they had not a single clue.
980.69s - 982.33s |  Man in the middle.
982.33s - 983.79s |  Who would have known it's that powerful?
985.69s - 989.13s |  So for my last attack, and this is the one that, you know,
989.39s - 991.33s |  I had a lot of help with this.
991.33s - 993.29s |  I did not write this rope flight application.
993.29s - 996.59s |  It was actually written by some of my friends at the IV and feed facility,
996.97s - 998.89s |  specifically the JSTAR team.
998.89s - 1002.29s |  And they wrote this rogue flight application that they called Havoc,
1002.49s - 1004.87s |  which is a backdoor into CFS.
1004.99s - 1007.23s |  I just kind of modified a little bit to fit our needs.
1007.23s - 1010.07s |  But this is pretty dangerous.
1010.07s - 1013.47s |  This assumes that the initial access vector was the supply chain risk.
1014.03s - 1017.69s |  And in this idea, because supply chain risk,
1017.69s - 1021.69s |  our flight application is uploaded, the ground operations not aware.
1021.73s - 1023.89s |  And because we can talk to the front end processor,
1023.89s - 1026.59s |  we can then talk to our flight app.
1027.49s - 1029.43s |  Specifically, this flight app does three things.
1029.43s - 1033.39s |  It can upload a file, download a file and basically give us full command
1033.39s - 1036.49s |  access to the satellite, because a lot of satellites right now
1036.49s - 1039.29s |  are can be are running on a Linux system.
1039.53s - 1041.37s |  So we have full Linux terminal with this.
1042.93s - 1044.79s |  So, yeah, let me show you.
1044.79s - 1048.99s |  So once again, all I have to do is just point it at the front end processor
1048.99s - 1053.03s |  IP and port and just select which command I want.
1053.03s - 1055.43s |  I send a quick no op just to make sure it's working.
1056.27s - 1060.73s |  But really, I'm more interested in uploading a file as a good hacker.
1060.73s - 1063.49s |  I was trying to think of a way to take over the satellite
1063.49s - 1065.73s |  and make sure it was mine and nobody else can touch it.
1066.07s - 1068.09s |  So I created a ransomware script,
1069.33s - 1070.73s |  you know, because why not?
1070.73s - 1072.37s |  I thought that'd be fun.
1072.37s - 1073.29s |  So we send that up.
1073.29s - 1076.39s |  I wanted to be low and slow so that nobody could really detect me.
1076.39s - 1078.19s |  So it takes a good couple of minutes.
1079.39s - 1083.49s |  But it's it's a pretty fun idea to think that you're going to ransomware
1083.49s - 1084.69s |  a satellite, right?
1084.69s - 1087.49s |  Because then you only you're the only ones that going to attack it.
1087.79s - 1089.39s |  I'm going to get Buku money.
1089.39s - 1092.83s |  And, you know, whatever mission is just, you know, as well.
1093.83s - 1096.83s |  So, yeah, I upload the satellite and I'm going to run my command
1096.83s - 1098.83s |  literally like I was on a Linux terminal.
1098.83s - 1102.73s |  So make sure it can execute and encrypt the system.
1105.43s - 1107.97s |  Now, the fun thing with CFS and the reason why this works
1108.01s - 1111.07s |  is all of their flight applications are actually in their own
1111.07s - 1112.87s |  individual startup scripts.
1112.87s - 1118.05s |  So I can encrypt everything except for the command ingestion, the base CFS,
1118.05s - 1120.81s |  the you know, the bus and of course, my own application,
1120.81s - 1123.35s |  because I want to be able to talk to myself.
1123.35s - 1127.35s |  And once that's encrypted, I just do a hardware reboot
1127.35s - 1129.47s |  because I have the command and telemetry database
1129.47s - 1132.07s |  because who doesn't need a good reboot after a while?
1132.07s - 1134.05s |  And then we just wait for it to come back up.
1134.51s - 1137.05s |  Now, I will tell you that this takes a long time to come up.
1137.05s - 1139.59s |  So I'm just going to talk about Havoc and how awesome it is
1139.83s - 1143.73s |  because with this tool, and I'm really excited to continue researching on this,
1144.03s - 1145.79s |  we can do so much more.
1145.79s - 1149.79s |  I can actually start doing way more Sparta TTPs with this one tool
1149.99s - 1152.59s |  than I could with the actual man in the middle of the road ground station,
1152.83s - 1155.39s |  because I'm going to have access to the actual bus
1155.39s - 1157.39s |  so we can do replay bus replay attacks.
1157.39s - 1161.49s |  We'll be able to do, you know, GPS spoofing, attack the hardware.
1161.89s - 1164.89s |  There's all kinds of things we can do.
1164.89s - 1167.89s |  So while it's getting ready, I was just opening up some command center
1167.89s - 1169.89s |  so you can see that they have no access,
1170.19s - 1173.83s |  because I really want to prove that point of how like in the dark they are,
1174.07s - 1176.83s |  because there is no especially in this system,
1176.83s - 1179.89s |  there's no way to run a script like I just did.
1180.13s - 1183.23s |  So literally, I am the only one that's able to do anything.
1183.23s - 1185.17s |  They can't even upload a file.
1185.17s - 1188.77s |  So they're they're really, you know, not doing good.
1189.03s - 1190.39s |  Yeah. So telemetry is down.
1190.39s - 1191.97s |  They're not even getting telemetry back.
1191.97s - 1194.01s |  They're not sending any commands.
1194.35s - 1195.47s |  Nothing's happening.
1195.47s - 1197.11s |  I've already sent my ransom.
1197.11s - 1200.21s |  You know, I want to get paid a lot of money for whatever system this is.
1200.51s - 1203.65s |  And if I was a good hacker, of course, I'm going to go decrypt it.
1203.85s - 1205.57s |  You know, make sure they get their stuff back.
1205.57s - 1208.47s |  I don't want to keep that running.
1208.47s - 1209.71s |  And that's what I'm just doing here.
1209.71s - 1211.25s |  I'm just going to send a quick decrypt command
1211.25s - 1213.85s |  because I'm not going to encrypt my own script
1213.85s - 1215.55s |  and make sure it's decrypted.
1215.55s - 1219.85s |  Do another reboot of the system and then wait for it to come back up
1219.99s - 1221.99s |  and then they'll have full access again.
1221.99s - 1225.63s |  So if you ever wanted to know how to ransomware a satellite,
1226.85s - 1227.85s |  there you go.
1229.19s - 1229.63s |  All right.
1229.63s - 1233.03s |  So while this is running, if that was the end of my attacks
1233.03s - 1237.33s |  and if any of these kind of gave you like heartburn, made you worry,
1237.33s - 1239.85s |  you know, like, oh, my God, what's happening?
1239.85s - 1240.85s |  Why are they so simple?
1240.85s - 1243.19s |  Why are she able to do this with nothing but an ARP spoof?
1243.73s - 1247.79s |  Luckily, every single attack I did is described in Sparta.
1248.23s - 1252.17s |  And with those descriptions, we've actually included countermeasures.
1252.67s - 1256.47s |  So these countermeasures will tell you exactly how to, you know, how to block it.
1256.69s - 1261.19s |  It will tell you all of the different NIST controls that you can add.
1261.19s - 1265.79s |  If you're an ISO 27001 person, those are in there, too.
1265.93s - 1270.03s |  We've tried to map it to every single thing that people that we know
1270.03s - 1271.93s |  in the industry use.
1271.93s - 1275.83s |  So, yeah, I would definitely recommend going and looking and reading on that
1275.83s - 1281.23s |  and just making sure that you are, you know, you have those controls enabled.
1283.01s - 1283.27s |  All right.
1283.27s - 1286.17s |  So in summary, defense in depth is very important.
1286.43s - 1289.41s |  There are a lot of different ways that these attacks could be blocked.
1289.41s - 1294.01s |  But, you know, really, we wouldn't have realized that until I did this research.
1294.51s - 1297.37s |  For example, the best way that these attacks could have been blocked,
1297.37s - 1301.07s |  which I mentioned here, is either including in the bulk crypto unit
1301.07s - 1304.27s |  way earlier on in the system, which, you know,
1304.37s - 1306.91s |  I would not have been able to communicate with my rogue app.
1306.95s - 1312.55s |  The rogue ground station wouldn't have worked without the encryption keys.
1312.85s - 1316.65s |  So that would have definitely blocked a vast majority of this information
1316.77s - 1317.85s |  or these attacks.
1319.11s - 1322.17s |  And I also include the space data link security.
1322.17s - 1325.17s |  If you do use CCSDS, it's another protocol that they've released
1325.77s - 1329.15s |  to include both authentication and encryption to their packets.
1329.41s - 1333.17s |  So once again, it's very simple things that you can add
1333.17s - 1335.45s |  just to block these kind of attacks.
1337.65s - 1339.91s |  I've also included in this PowerPoint some reading material
1339.91s - 1342.57s |  because I know you guys like to read and you want more things to read.
1342.91s - 1347.45s |  So a lot of these briefs are on Sparta, like how we thought of the idea.
1347.91s - 1351.21s |  We've also included a lot of links to Sparta, like how to get started with it,
1351.21s - 1354.01s |  where to get started with it, because it's a huge application.
1354.71s - 1357.87s |  And there's a lot of different media examples of other talks
1357.87s - 1360.21s |  that have been done on this kind of sort of same topic.
1360.99s - 1365.89s |  I've also included these more DEF CON talks that my colleague,
1365.89s - 1369.61s |  Brandon Bailey, have done, also including some of the SISAT work he's done
1369.81s - 1374.01s |  and a lot of different papers and articles that also talk about different
1374.01s - 1376.85s |  attack vectors and countermeasures that you can include.
1378.15s - 1380.05s |  And that's it.
1381.89s - 1384.79s |  So thank you very much.
1386.25s - 1391.96s |  Good. I can't see anything.
1392.56s - 1396.14s |  All right. I can't see that light is black.
1397.74s - 1398.94s |  Are there any questions?
1399.70s - 1401.80s |  I can't see if they have any questions, though.
1403.60s - 1411.61s |  Anybody have any questions?
1422.68s - 1427.24s |  So with this is just assuming CFS, which CFS, if you're not aware,
1427.24s - 1431.10s |  is NASA's open source satellite kind of information.
1431.10s - 1434.40s |  So you can actually go to their GitHub, download CFS and build your own spacecraft.
1435.10s - 1439.78s |  So CFS has this methodology in which, like I said, it uploads or it starts
1440.14s - 1443.90s |  all of its flight applications through those ISO files.
1444.20s - 1447.90s |  So if, you know, say I wanted to do a supply chain attack,
1447.90s - 1452.84s |  I would just find that development server and just put my ISO file in there.
1453.00s - 1456.98s |  Or if they had like upload file protocol like CFTP,
1457.64s - 1461.30s |  then I would be able to upload my own startup script and just do another reboot.
1462.24s - 1464.10s |  So there's a lot of different methods
1464.10s - 1467.28s |  in which I could get that flight application on to the actual system.
1471.62s - 1477.20s |  Yeah. Yes.
1477.20s - 1482.11s |  Any other questions?
1482.31s - 1484.11s |  All right. Thanks, guys.
