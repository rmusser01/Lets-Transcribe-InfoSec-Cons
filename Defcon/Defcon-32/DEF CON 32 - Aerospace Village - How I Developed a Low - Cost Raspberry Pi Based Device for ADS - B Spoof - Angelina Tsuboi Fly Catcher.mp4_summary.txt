**Introduction**
- Presentation at DEF CON 32 Aerospace Village
- Focus on **ADS-B** security and personal project **Flycatcher**

**Flycatcher Device Overview**
- Designed for effective **ADS-B** monitoring
- Detects foreign instances of aircraft spoofing
- Low-cost, reliable, created using **Raspberry Pi**
- Compatible with multiple software-defined radio signal sources
- Utilizes a custom **convolutional neural network** for signal parsing

**Background**
- **Cybersecurity** field newcomer with a decade of software development experience
- Focus on **aerospace security** and aviation due to piloting experience

**ADS-B Technology**
- Stands for **Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast**
- Mandated for surveillance and signals intelligence on airplanes
- **Automatic**: No manual input required from pilots
- **Dependent**: Requires **GPS** signals from satellites
- **Surveillance**: Provides comprehensive aircraft data
- Continuously broadcasts data for **ATC** and other pilots

**ADS-B Signal Structure**
- Signals derived from **Global Navigational Satellite System**
- Beaconed out via **ADS-B out** hardware on airplanes
- Transmitted on **1090 MHz** protocol
- Receivable by airplanes, ground-based receivers, and **air traffic control**

**Core Components of ADS-B**
- **GPS receiver** for positioning information
- **Transponder** on planes using **MODE-S protocol**
- **ADS-B in** for continuous pilot monitoring of nearby air traffic

**ADS-B Vulnerabilities**
- **Unauthenticated** and **unencrypted** transmissions
- Open to attack vectors: jamming, spoofing, replay attacks, message injection

**Types of Attacks**
- **Jamming**: Flooding frequency with garbled data
- **Spoofing**: Creating ghost planes with fabricated data
- **Replay attacks**: Duplicating aircraft signals from earlier transmissions
- **Message injection**: Altering telemetry data like altitude, airspeed

**Project Focus on Spoofing**
- Detection using **artificial intelligence**
- Ground-based hackers create ghost aircraft by mimicking ADS-B protocol

**Device Construction**
- Four-step build process: ground station setup, device portability, deep neural network training, data collection
- Portable device with **Raspberry Pi**, **FlightAware Pro Stick Plus SDR**, **1090 MHz antenna**

**Signal Decoding and Visualization**
- **DUM1090** software for signal decoding
- **FlightAware GUI** for visualizing data

**Algorithm Development**
- **Dense Neural Network (DNN)** for spoofed signal classification
- **TensorFlow** library utilized with **ReLU activation functions**

**Data Collection and Testing**
- Historical ADS-B records from **ADS-B Exchange**, **FlightAware**, **OpenSky**
- Device tested on sport cruiser aircraft in South Bay, Los Angeles

**Improvements and Future Work**
- Incorporate **RSSI fingerprinting** for signal analysis
- Explore other deep learning models like **recurrent neural networks**
- Enhance training data with **data augmentation** techniques

**Conclusion**
- Emphasis on improving accuracy and robustness of spoof detection
