5.33s - 11.57s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Thank you. All right. So I'm Cassie Crossley. I'm with, I see all the cameras, all my friends.
11.57s - 17.33s |  I'm with Schneider Electric. I am the vice president for supply chain security. If you
17.33s - 23.01s |  don't know what that is, it's sort of a different kind of role. I have been with the company 14
23.01s - 30.05s |  years. We sell a lot of products. I'll show you some of the brands in a few minutes. And I am a
30.05s - 36.29s |  product security officer, also from the CISO cybersecurity and product security organization.
36.29s - 40.69s |  So I'm going to talk about SBOMs, software bill of materials, but the rest of the time,
40.69s - 45.25s |  I'm going to say SBOMs, except for as people come in, I might repeat that once or twice,
45.25s - 50.69s |  and how we leverage them. But first, let me tell you a bit about who our company is,
50.69s - 58.37s |  just so you know. We are not German. We are headquartered in France, and we are a 36 billion
58.37s - 64.77s |  euro company. We are spread all around the world. We do a lot of products. The reason I mentioned
64.77s - 73.65s |  the ICS village is, uh, we have a lot of products for industrial controls systems, and we have
73.65s - 79.25s |  building operations systems. So you might recognize some of the names. Aviva, uh, that's, uh, you know,
79.25s - 85.89s |  you might find that in manufacturing. APC. Who had an APC, you know, unit sitting on their desk
85.89s - 91.81s |  in the 80s and 90s. Yep, that's ours. Uh, but we do a lot of products, secure power products
91.81s - 98.53s |  for data centers. Uh, also Square D, who's seen Square D panels all over the decades. That's one
98.53s - 104.37s |  of our brands. So you, you know, you probably know us from our brands. I may not necessarily
104.37s - 109.33s |  know Schneider Electric because we get asked, you know, do we do, uh, elevators, escalators, so on
109.33s - 115.09s |  and so forth. And we're not a trucking company either. So that's who we are. Now, what I'm going
115.09s - 121.49s |  to be talking about today is, uh, part of that supply chain. So I work with a just wonderful
121.49s - 131.01s |  organization, 140,000 employees. We have over 54,000 suppliers. Many of them, uh, let's say
131.01s - 137.57s |  over 20,000 of them are part of what we call direct. That means that they work with our products.
137.57s - 144.45s |  So if you look at our product portfolio, we have hundreds of thousands of SKUs. Not all of them
144.45s - 150.05s |  are intelligent SKUs. They could be cables. They could be any kind of non-intelligent device.
150.05s - 156.53s |  Intelligent devices, over 10,000. Uh, so those are ones that may have, uh, firmware. We also have
156.53s - 162.77s |  software, cloud products, mobile apps, things like that. Just all the range, that's what we have. So
162.77s - 168.69s |  I'm going to be talking about those digital products today. With those suppliers, about 2,000
168.69s - 175.97s |  or more of them actually provide us, could be software libraries, it can be, uh, manufacturing
175.97s - 182.05s |  equipment systems and platforms where they're flashing firmware. We can work with suppliers
182.05s - 186.29s |  who are doing our development. So there's all these different kinds of suppliers that we're
186.29s - 192.37s |  working with. And I wanted to just explain that from a footprint standpoint, because from a
192.37s - 198.77s |  software and firmware point of view, it's not just Schneider Electric employees that are all part
198.77s - 205.97s |  of this supplier ecosystem. And so I know this is an eye chart. I just wanted to show it so you can,
205.97s - 213.17s |  uh, if you want, there's other, uh, presentations I've done and I can provide this. This is a PDF
213.17s - 218.69s |  that I've got. And this is our supply chain security platform. I just bring it up because I
218.69s - 224.61s |  wanted to represent, uh, we're going to be talking about the software bill materials. That's the
224.61s - 232.05s |  operational group that I run. But I'm also, you know, these initiatives are all part of the supply
232.05s - 237.57s |  chain security at our company. Thirteen initiatives. And so I know you can't read it, so I'm going to
237.57s - 243.41s |  go through it real quickly so you understand traversally. There's supply chain digital policies,
243.41s - 248.45s |  customer authority and requirements, third party cyber security. It's a lot of what I'm working
248.45s - 254.45s |  on. Vulnerability management, which is part of this talk, this how we use SBOMs as part of that.
254.45s - 259.81s |  We've got cyber defense and incident response. And then you've got on the left, you've got secure
259.81s - 266.37s |  development and design. And so you've got product and system security. As a product security
266.37s - 272.29s |  officer, that's, you know, a lot of what the world I was when I was owning a lot, most, you know, a
272.29s - 278.45s |  lot of that team from the governance. Then you've got SBOMs and then you've got, uh, the R&D
278.45s - 285.81s |  activities for cyber security. If you ever want to see this talk described, uh, if you go onto
285.81s - 292.61s |  YouTube, S4 for this past year, which is an industrial control conference, you should be able to
292.61s - 299.33s |  search for S4 and my name and find the YouTube video or just hit me up on LinkedIn. And then
299.33s - 304.37s |  there's technology validation. Think of pen testing, working with third party companies and
304.37s - 309.41s |  organizations, but also, uh, different organizations like the Department of Energy to test our
309.41s - 315.49s |  products and then source code governance. Big, big thing that everybody should be doing. If not,
315.49s - 321.17s |  we need to, you know, uh, ramp that up for everybody else. Uh, the middle one is industrial
321.17s - 327.57s |  control, uh, industrial activities. So how we manage our floors, um, and our production lines
327.57s - 332.85s |  and then project supply chain security, which is if we're doing the projects to actually deploy
332.85s - 340.45s |  it. And lastly, uh, customer facing activities. So I wanted to just give you a view. I am going to
340.45s - 346.61s |  concentrate today on software bill materials and the initiative. And I'm gonna go through just a
346.61s - 352.37s |  sort of primer. If you don't know what a software bill materials is, if you have not had to create
352.45s - 359.17s |  one or ingest one, that's, or, you know, there's different terms for that word too, is I've created
359.17s - 367.01s |  a picture, uh, based off of, uh, what we would explain it to our internal organization is that
367.01s - 372.37s |  this software bill material standard kind of tree structure, think about it that way, is you have a
372.37s - 378.85s |  product over here on the right. It can have first level dependencies, uh, which could be commercial
378.85s - 383.57s |  libraries. It could be an embedded operating system in the case of firmware. It could be
383.57s - 388.61s |  proprietary software. So that's code that our teams have written. It can have open source
388.61s - 392.85s |  libraries. People sometimes think when they're scanning, oh, just, you know, just the open
392.85s - 398.05s |  source libraries and S bombs. Not, not that. I mean, you at least would have, if you've written
398.05s - 406.05s |  any code, you've got your own proprietary library or something listed. And then those products
406.05s - 413.17s |  and, and different systems and areas can all have what we call transitive dependencies. So
413.17s - 418.37s |  inside, for example, open source libraries can call other libraries, right? Um, and those are
418.37s - 423.89s |  all transitive dependencies. So, and you may not know them, but what's being called, especially if
423.89s - 431.33s |  it's a dot net DLL, right? So I don't have the S bomb yet for the dot net DLL. If anybody does
431.33s - 437.81s |  have it, please send it to me. Um, I would, I would, uh, really like to see a lot of these
437.81s - 445.25s |  libraries, especially binaries that, uh, are frequently used, um, for us to be able to have
445.25s - 452.05s |  access to those and it'll be coming. So what I wanted to talk about just for a second next is
452.05s - 458.45s |  just the journey because it was a plain and important part with where we are and there's
458.53s - 466.61s |  always time to catch the train. And what we did is all of a sudden back in the, um, 2019 I
466.61s - 472.37s |  received a contract from a customer, a utility saying, give us your S bomb. And I'm like, well,
472.37s - 478.45s |  what's that? And, uh, so I found out about the, our teams knew our vulnerability management
478.45s - 483.97s |  teams knew and they said, hey, there's this NTIA initiative. So I immediately got on board
483.97s - 490.53s |  with, uh, one of the working groups and then I, you know, continued working with them and we
490.53s - 497.17s |  created an adoption and awareness group. So since 2020 I've been helping deliver the message of S
497.17s - 504.53s |  bombs. At that same time, uh, we had COVID, but the executive order in May of 2020 came out.
504.53s - 509.97s |  Well, I helped work on the, uh, the, let's just say the definition for S bomb by that time,
509.97s - 516.45s |  cause I'd been working with them. So at 2020, we have that executive order called 14 zero to
516.45s - 522.45s |  eight in the U S that mentions S bombs and gives a definition and told NTIA to give us
522.45s - 528.61s |  minimum elements. Like what should you put into it to distribute it? And that played a key role
528.61s - 534.93s |  in really moving things forward as an industry to like have something that specifically mentions it
534.93s - 542.29s |  and carried forward. So this is a slide where I talk about sort of the drivers for it. Um, it was
542.29s - 548.69s |  really important because not everybody sells to utilities, right? So until then, really only those
548.69s - 555.09s |  of us that are in that space were being asked for S bombs and it was in the contract, but not
555.09s - 563.09s |  actually requested. So when the executive order came out, I required our teams to start, uh,
563.09s - 567.49s |  the concept of S bombs. And when I say teams, I'm talking about the product development teams.
567.49s - 573.49s |  So I, in the governance group, I owned the secure development lifecycle policy. So what I did is I
573.49s - 581.81s |  modified that policy saying every team must provide an S bomb or provide us the, you know, the binary
581.81s - 588.21s |  or whatever, so we could scan it to create the S bomb. So that was in 2020, June of 2020. I changed
588.29s - 594.45s |  the rule to say starting in January of 21, I'm going to start requiring S bombs from every single
594.45s - 600.45s |  team. And so, and so, we have, I told you, tens of thousands of projects. We have 500 projects going
603.01s - 610.61s |  on at a time. So there's a lot of releases going on, um, and the technologies can be all over the
610.61s - 616.61s |  place, right? So as I mentioned, but there's also legacy platforms and legacy software that were
618.45s - 624.85s |  usually updating once a year. Some products are more frequent, but in a firmware world, uh, a lot
624.85s - 629.73s |  of the products they have to go through regression testing, interoperability, safety testing. So
629.73s - 635.73s |  they go through this cycle of product development and with all of these projects, um, they do not
635.73s - 643.73s |  have, let's just say, the majority of them do not have modern CICD pipelines. All right? If they
643.81s - 651.17s |  do, it's like super cool and super easy, but most of them don't. So with the re these requirements,
651.17s - 658.37s |  we had to figure out how are we going to build this process to start getting S bombs so that in
658.37s - 666.37s |  21, the next, that next year we can start delivering them to our customers. And so as part of
666.37s - 672.37s |  that, I worked with a consultant company and really said, okay, I'm, I've got this idea for a
672.37s - 676.85s |  process. I need to be able to collect it. I need to be able to get all my proprietary
676.85s - 683.25s |  information, all of the information from maybe third party code and then also open source
683.25s - 690.29s |  code. And of course, if we have the actual code generating it, uh, you know, on site, it can
690.29s - 696.13s |  generate the S bomb. I'll talk more about the binary analysis generation in a minute, but what
696.13s - 703.25s |  we do is we were bringing them all together. At first we were collecting the binaries and
703.25s - 709.01s |  creating the scans and storing them in box folders and then later SharePoint folders. But I knew
709.01s - 716.05s |  that wasn't going to be sufficient because when providing all of those, so an S bomb is per
716.05s - 721.49s |  version, product released version. So like some of those products are only going to have one a
721.49s - 727.17s |  year. But some of them, uh, in that if they release quarterly or more frequently, especially
727.17s - 731.93s |  some software applications, they were going to have to have, you know, more frequent S bombs. So
731.93s - 738.77s |  we're talking, my expectation is, you know, with versions, thousands and thousands of
738.77s - 744.45s |  thousands of S bombs. So a lot of companies may only have to think about, oh, for internal,
744.45s - 751.25s |  you know, for releasing to customers, I may only have to do 10 or 20. Well, I, I knew that
751.25s - 755.81s |  wasn't going to be my case. So I needed to be able to think about how am I also going to
755.81s - 762.45s |  distribute it and use it both internally, but also to customers. And so, uh, we went through
762.45s - 767.89s |  at the time where I was working on this process, started going through, uh, an understanding and
767.89s - 774.41s |  a process to say, okay, I need a tool that can do all of, you know, what I really want to be
774.41s - 779.89s |  able to do, which is be able to provide it to customers in a secure manner. Because as I
779.89s - 785.53s |  mentioned at the beginning, we are critical infrastructure and, uh, I was one of the ones
785.53s - 789.89s |  that were loudly saying, I'm not going to give an S bomb, I'm not putting it on the web unless
789.89s - 795.85s |  it was, you know, probably a, a home product. Uh, we do sell some of those in Europe, but for
795.85s - 801.25s |  critical infrastructure, uh, it would require an NDA. And another thing about Schneider
801.25s - 806.69s |  Electric is we don't do a lot of our direct sales. We go through engineering firms, there's
806.73s - 813.25s |  integrators, there's all sorts of ways that products can be sold. And so I only know
813.25s - 821.09s |  about 36 to 40 percent of my direct customers. So we needed to be able to say, okay, you have
821.09s - 826.61s |  this product, um, we want to sign an NDA cause I don't have a direct contract with them. And
826.61s - 831.65s |  this is, I think for those of us in the critical infrastructure, pretty much that's how the
831.65s - 837.93s |  groups are, are working with. Now I get requests today from, uh, customers that we
837.93s - 843.25s |  directly sell to, customers that go through integrators. I get requests from the labs that
843.25s - 847.89s |  we're specifically working with, like with Department of Energy, where we've had, um, work
847.89s - 852.73s |  with them and all of them, they're able to go into this tool that I'm going to talk about in a
852.73s - 859.77s |  moment. But the, um, indirect customers, my, my vision and what I'm working on is that I
859.85s - 865.93s |  would provide the SBOMs to asset management companies because if you look at this room and
865.93s - 871.37s |  there's sensors and everything, you know, hopefully this convention center has an asset
871.37s - 878.33s |  inventory, cross your fingers, um, but likely it doesn't even have the firmware registered in
878.33s - 884.61s |  that asset inventory. So the SBOM really can't do the building maintenance staff and the
884.61s - 889.45s |  facility management any good if it's an SBOM from the current one, if they're running a
889.45s - 894.85s |  version from like, you know, three years ago. And that's a problem right now in the
894.85s - 899.37s |  software bill of materials industry. It's great for procurement for you to be able to ask
899.37s - 904.01s |  and say, hey, what's in here? But if you want to use it for some operational and risk
904.01s - 908.97s |  analysis, and I'll talk more about that, but if you want to do that, you need to know what
908.97s - 914.41s |  version you're running. And so understanding that and working with that indirect customer
914.45s - 920.61s |  pipeline is something that I'm focused on. Also CP cert. So if you don't know internal, we've
920.61s - 926.33s |  got a product cert, uh, team that works with all of our different organizations and business
926.33s - 931.81s |  units and lines of business and they are the ones that help focus on if there's new, uh,
931.81s - 938.81s |  celebrity CVEs that come out, but also if we're doing disclosures and such. And they need
938.81s - 942.77s |  to be able to search that. And that's really why the vulnerability management team knew
942.81s - 947.29s |  about SBOMs because they wanted to be able to leverage it. And so I'm going to be showing
947.29s - 954.29s |  you exactly how that happens, uh, in a moment. But the internal dev teams, um, I'm a developer
955.13s - 962.05s |  by background really long ago, but I've led a lot of dev teams, you know, up until about
962.05s - 969.05s |  ten years ago. I swapped back and forth between development and IT. And I know that I kept
969.93s - 974.93s |  lists of, let's just say open source or licensed information in spreadsheets, right? I mean,
978.21s - 983.29s |  and then we just put it there. We wouldn't update. We, you know, nobody, it would just stay
983.29s - 988.67s |  there. Like, right, I did it for the legal reasons, so somebody checked it out and I'm good
988.67s - 995.13s |  and I don't go on. Well, for a lot of us that are working with older technologies, being
995.13s - 1002.29s |  able to, uh, really re-examine those libraries didn't start happening until vulnerabilities
1002.29s - 1008.53s |  came about. And, you know, obviously there's some classic vulnerabilities, especially in
1008.53s - 1013.45s |  our space. There can be some on proprietary software, but things that you would normally
1013.45s - 1019.41s |  see like log4j and other ones that I'm going to talk about. And the development teams needed
1019.41s - 1024.57s |  to have that information quickly because every time there was a CVE, somebody would go,
1024.57s - 1028.65s |  hey, you know, do you got this? Do you got this? Do you got this? And we had a really
1028.65s - 1035.07s |  organized fashion to do it, but it's still time consuming. And that's where we're headed
1035.07s - 1040.77s |  with our SBOM vulnerability management program. So I just talked about the vulnerabilities.
1040.77s - 1046.61s |  Here's sort of a picture of what happens is we're issuing that request to the teams. So I
1046.61s - 1051.89s |  told you, you know, we've got 500 projects going on at a time, but we've got thousands of
1051.93s - 1057.21s |  SKUs, right? And when somebody has to identify a vulnerability, they have to look at, well,
1057.21s - 1062.71s |  was it in this other version? You know, did we update it? Because something like OpenSSL
1062.71s - 1067.59s |  when it had, uh, when it had some vulnerabilities but only in certain versions, they have to
1067.59s - 1072.43s |  know exactly which versions. So that could have been that way in version 7, but not in
1072.43s - 1077.43s |  version 9. So it's a lot of, I lost, okay. It's a lot of work for these teams, um, and then
1077.93s - 1084.71s |  of course, if it happens at Christmas or, you know, in August or whatever, it's even, you know,
1084.71s - 1092.01s |  it takes longer for that analysis. Um, so all of that work for identifying the vulnerabilities,
1092.01s - 1097.01s |  we issue these impact assessments. And with the SBOMs, what we're able to do now is look
1099.85s - 1104.85s |  more specifically by saying, okay, we're going to look at our SBOMs and actually make sure
1107.51s - 1112.97s |  that those teams are responding, first of all. But secondly, we're able to give them an
1112.97s - 1118.35s |  indicator saying, hey, this is showing in your SBOM, you know, please, uh, make sure you
1118.35s - 1123.35s |  work on it and prioritize it, um, and make sure it happens right away because we like to
1123.35s - 1128.73s |  issue those security bulletins, especially for celebrity CVEs, you know, as soon as
1128.73s - 1134.69s |  possible. And they get updated. So the log for J1, we issued one within just a couple days
1134.73s - 1139.87s |  and we kept appending and updating it as more information from other teams came about,
1139.87s - 1144.63s |  we would add that data. Now, one thing that was interesting, uh, for that is I had a
1144.63s - 1149.31s |  customer, uh, come to me and they said, you know, you, you changed it. You said you
1149.31s - 1153.21s |  weren't affected and then you were. I said, that's because we heard a, you know, a third
1153.21s - 1158.21s |  party proprietary library was affected. And so we had to update our, our issue, you know,
1158.81s - 1163.81s |  our list to say that product was affected and here's, you know, the mitigation or the patch
1166.61s - 1172.05s |  or whatever happened in that case. And that's the importance of SBOMs. If I had had at
1172.05s - 1176.03s |  least some indication, I would have known to go to that third party right then or that
1176.03s - 1182.37s |  product team would. But without having those third party SBOMs and if they have the
1182.37s - 1187.71s |  source code, they can do, you know, scanning and evaluation. But if it's a binary or, you
1187.71s - 1194.11s |  know, we don't have all the information, then we're, you know, having to go and query and
1194.11s - 1200.05s |  query and query. So it's really important for us and for you all to have that additional
1200.05s - 1205.49s |  information, that transparency. Now we can't necessarily say it's affected and that's the
1205.49s - 1210.49s |  most important part of all of this is an SBOM cannot say I am affected, yes, no. So I'm
1210.85s - 1215.85s |  going to say that one more time. An SBOM will not tell you by itself if I am affected, yes
1220.29s - 1225.69s |  or no. There's something that we're working on as an industry called VEX, the vulnerability
1225.69s - 1232.71s |  exploitability exchange. And that would say for those two CVEs for log4j, it could be an
1232.71s - 1238.05s |  in progress, it could say not affected, it could say affected and here's a patch or, you
1238.07s - 1242.65s |  know, not in this, there's different statuses. That will give you the answer. And I
1242.65s - 1247.89s |  mentioned, I provide a picture in my book to say if you are looking, and I'll talk about my
1247.89s - 1254.29s |  book in a sec, but uh if you are looking to see if you're affected, you will not be able to
1254.29s - 1259.47s |  make the final decision just like that CP cert team that we have can't decide for that
1259.47s - 1266.37s |  product team. Somebody's actually on that team validating it. And in the future, you know,
1266.39s - 1271.43s |  as much as you can say that version, but anybody who's a developer here knows you can
1271.43s - 1277.71s |  backport patches and so you could have already had a security patch for that in the
1277.71s - 1283.25s |  product. You could have not used certain pieces of that library. You could have done
1283.25s - 1289.39s |  different things. And that's everything that has the actual team has to answer. And so
1289.41s - 1296.39s |  what this has done for us is it's sped up our time. So we have gone through, you know,
1296.39s - 1302.45s |  just a very long multiple year process where we've been working and collecting these S
1302.45s - 1310.47s |  bombs, but also, you know, we want to be able to speed up our teams and reduce noise, you
1310.47s - 1315.67s |  know, bring it really to a point. So we had two main metrics that we've been following is a
1315.69s - 1320.69s |  reduction of staff hours and I we've definitely have improved that by over half. And, uh,
1322.97s - 1327.67s |  that's a big deal when you're talking about the size that we are doing. So not only is it
1327.67s - 1333.11s |  the reduction of staff hours from the vulnerability team, but let's say you have a product
1333.11s - 1338.11s |  that's, um, multi years old and, uh, you know, let's let's say, uh, Sarah takes over the
1338.59s - 1343.61s |  maintenance of that, she doesn't have the ten years history of that code all the time. But if
1347.21s - 1353.41s |  she knew that the from the S bomb that it has that library, she'll be able to go and look and
1353.41s - 1359.79s |  be able to dig into it. So instead of wading through, you know, a lot of just different
1359.79s - 1364.79s |  kinds of things, we're able to help pinpoint and be able to give some direction so we can
1364.91s - 1369.91s |  get started faster. But also the reduction in time to identify that vulnerability
1373.09s - 1378.09s |  component is when open SSL, even in November of 20, uh, 22, when they released that, they
1381.89s - 1386.73s |  were going to release two and they did, um, to say it's going to be in these this version.
1386.73s - 1391.31s |  That's all we got was a heads up, which was awesome. And what that did is we were able to
1391.33s - 1397.77s |  generate every single library or every single product that we knew that we had the records
1397.77s - 1402.11s |  for the S bomb to be able to tell those teams, hey, get ready, you know, set aside
1402.11s - 1406.65s |  sometimes for, uh, a couple days. So if you are an open source maintainer, if you can do
1406.65s - 1411.65s |  that for me in the future, I would love you because I absolutely can use that knowledge
1413.49s - 1419.15s |  just like for open SSL to say, okay, everybody heads up, you know, this is going to come
1419.17s - 1424.17s |  down the pike. And so for what we're doing and these are screen cut captures from our S
1426.81s - 1432.11s |  bomb management solution that's from Cybeats and I was the first customer and I gave them
1432.11s - 1437.31s |  my design of what I wanted and they've added so much more to it because I need to be able
1437.31s - 1443.13s |  to search and do this quickly. Um, and I had a lot of additional requirements about how
1443.13s - 1447.29s |  am I going to search and I want to be able to see, you know, all the known exploitable
1447.33s - 1451.67s |  vulnerabilities really quick, you know, things that my scanner tools, because one thing I
1451.67s - 1457.81s |  didn't mention and I mentioned it on the summary, is that with the binary analysis and I
1457.81s - 1462.81s |  think those that are in this world, it, it's only, it's only as good as it's good and most
1464.41s - 1469.41s |  of the time it can identify open source and it'll get close enough to the version of what
1469.95s - 1474.95s |  it is, but if you have two versions of something and it's 1.21 and 1.22, sometimes it can't
1478.89s - 1484.13s |  tell the difference, right? So, you know, it may say it's one version or another and the
1484.13s - 1489.27s |  teams have to validate that. So, but also it doesn't pick up proprietary open source, I
1489.27s - 1494.91s |  mean proprietary code or libraries. So it doesn't identify my libraries and we're working
1494.91s - 1501.35s |  closely with binary scanners that we use to do that. Um, and then it doesn't always
1501.35s - 1505.85s |  identify and most of the time doesn't identify commercial components. It can identify
1505.85s - 1511.33s |  Java libraries and dot net libraries. But if I purchased a commercial library, whether it
1511.33s - 1517.73s |  be the source code or binaries or something or libraries, you know, it can't necessarily
1517.73s - 1522.37s |  have the signatures for those because it's not a common thing, uh, and it will not be able
1522.37s - 1527.37s |  to identify. I did a binary scan of one of our, um, more older, uh, secure power APS, uh,
1530.71s - 1536.05s |  APC products and it had ten commercial libraries that we had purchased like over a decade
1536.05s - 1540.35s |  ago. It didn't find any of them because it didn't have enough of that information and
1540.35s - 1545.39s |  those signatures. So that's why moving it into the pipelines where you're building those
1545.39s - 1551.37s |  S-bombs is important. And so here, you know, what we've done is, you know, we can't
1551.37s - 1556.77s |  augment, so in those scanning tools, you know, they're just catching up, they've got the
1556.77s - 1561.21s |  S-bombs, but for me to be able to add additional information, especially proprietary
1561.21s - 1566.91s |  components and the other, uh, commercial components, I'm not able to make those kind of
1566.91s - 1573.09s |  adjustments. So in this tool, we're able to correct the version numbers, we're able to add
1573.09s - 1579.19s |  additional components that we're seeing and put it right into there. So I can check, I
1579.21s - 1584.45s |  personally, for our group, only store the production version, but I can do searches for
1584.45s - 1590.35s |  development versions and things like that. Uh, but I, because of the my volume, I only am
1590.35s - 1595.89s |  focused on the production version. So I talked about the open SSL, so I know it's a bit
1595.89s - 1601.13s |  harder to see on this screen right aw- right from here. But I can see the various versions,
1601.13s - 1607.95s |  so this really helps when I told you that open SSL had it in just a few different, uh,
1607.97s - 1612.97s |  library versions. So it was like 1.2, 1.3, but not 1.1 and 1.4 and so on and so forth. Um,
1615.67s - 1619.81s |  and it could be, uh, something out of this package library or, you know, in this
1619.81s - 1625.69s |  repository if it was, you know, in different areas. And so it's able to identify this
1625.69s - 1630.69s |  screen capture. I- I took one just to show you. It has, um, in this version of open SSL,
1631.47s - 1636.47s |  there's a low, one low CVE and one medium. And what I can do is I can, and I didn't take
1639.27s - 1643.61s |  screen captures so I wouldn't be showing the product names, but I can do a dependency
1643.61s - 1649.39s |  lookup so I can immediately go and see which products and packages it's in. So it's
1649.39s - 1655.33s |  really helped us be able to nail down and go straight away, uh, to that. I don't have to
1655.37s - 1661.47s |  re-scan anything to be able to do this because I'm operating it from the SBOM. So this is
1661.47s - 1666.47s |  what's released out there to our customers and I'm able to say, okay, make sure, and so this
1668.31s - 1672.59s |  is where the vulnerability management team is going straight in here and saying, okay, get
1672.59s - 1678.83s |  ready to do security disclosure notices because, you know, we have a ne- we have enough of
1678.83s - 1684.89s |  products that have this in there that we want to be able to do talk about that. And so
1684.89s - 1690.73s |  that's where that speed is happening really quickly. So on log4j, um, we were able to
1690.73s - 1695.77s |  scan our networks and identify log4j, but in products, you know, again, that's, that
1695.77s - 1700.97s |  could be in that transitive dependency library, you know, if you have a more complete SBOM
1700.97s - 1707.35s |  instead of just, uh, the first tier, uh, it's, it makes a big difference. We're able to
1707.35s - 1712.05s |  see those component packages and look for that. And especially it was tricky with the
1712.05s - 1718.35s |  log4j because, um, there were so many nuances, teams would then have to be able to see if
1718.35s - 1725.13s |  it could, if that, uh, was exploitable. So, I'm just out of time, so I, I, of course, and
1725.13s - 1730.63s |  not, not doing QA, I'm going to be out here, but I just wanted to talk about, summarize, we
1730.63s - 1737.63s |  have seen improved speed, um, so if as, you know, those that are developers in here, um, it
1737.63s - 1742.63s |  takes a lot of burden off of you to be able to provide this because if you have teams
1745.07s - 1749.67s |  focusing on vulnerability management and you're making sure that you have this data and
1749.67s - 1754.93s |  this availability, especially through the CICD pipeline, the quality is so much higher, um,
1754.93s - 1759.95s |  from a build SBOM, but that's gonna really improve your customer satisfaction, your
1760.17s - 1765.17s |  vulnerability management team, and for us, that transparency and trust is vital. Now, there's
1768.61s - 1773.01s |  lots of opportunities, especially in our company, we've got, uh, the SBOMs being created
1773.01s - 1778.89s |  out of a few CICD pipelines and we're, we finished the pilots and making sure, you know,
1778.89s - 1785.73s |  from an API call it can go directly into our tool and then we also have, of course, various
1785.75s - 1790.81s |  languages, things like that, different pipelines, all running different kinds of things, um, I
1790.81s - 1795.85s |  already mentioned the binary scanning, and then there's a lot of people not ready, so I meet
1795.85s - 1801.15s |  with suppliers every day and I, and I put in the contracts, I, you know, I want your SBOM
1801.15s - 1808.07s |  and they're like, okay, hold on. So, um, you know, I want to really encourage you to be
1808.07s - 1813.71s |  prepared for this because, uh, you know, it's only in certain things, FDA requires it and
1813.71s - 1818.73s |  so on, uh, and the US government can request it and they do, but your other customers, I'm
1820.99s - 1826.93s |  getting requests for SBOMs, access to it from customers every day. Again, I have a large
1826.93s - 1833.81s |  customer set, but, uh, it is really important for you to be able to provide this visibility
1833.81s - 1839.41s |  and it actually, it helps you encourage with some hygiene. And so, thank you all for
1839.41s - 1843.49s |  coming to see me today and see how we leveraged it. Thanks.
