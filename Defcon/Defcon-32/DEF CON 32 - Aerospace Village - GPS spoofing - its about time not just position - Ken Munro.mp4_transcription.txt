0.00s - 8.80s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Well, good afternoon. Now, I'm here to talk about time, time particularly in aviation.
9.52s - 16.00s |  Now, we're going to be talking about GNSS, GPS, of course, which you know, GPS is a subset of GNSS.
16.00s - 20.80s |  And forgive me, because I switched between the two terms a few times during the presentation.
20.80s - 25.60s |  So let's use them interchangeably for the moment. Now, a little bit about me and the
25.60s - 30.80s |  organization I work for. We are red teamers and pen testers, but we spend a lot of time working
30.80s - 37.04s |  in aviation. During COVID, a lot of airplanes were laid up and we got to do some vanilla research
37.04s - 41.76s |  working on retired airplanes, which is great fun. You learn a great deal very quickly about some
41.76s - 47.12s |  very new and very old systems too. Along the way, we've advised several airlines,
47.12s - 51.68s |  several manufacturers. We're on very good terms with Boeing. And we've had the great opportunity
51.68s - 59.44s |  to do some vanilla research on systems such as collision avoidance systems, instrument landing
59.44s - 65.44s |  systems, and also electronic flight bags, which I gave a talk about yesterday. Anyway, who am I?
65.44s - 72.80s |  Well, I'm a really bad pilot. I have had so many bad incidents happen to me. I've landed at the
72.80s - 78.00s |  wrong airport by mistake once. That was embarrassing. I had my engine quit on me once. Fortunately,
78.00s - 82.48s |  it happened just after I took off. The runway was long. We were fine. I've had my undercarriage
82.48s - 87.68s |  hang up twice. That was a bit awkward. And I very nearly crashed into three other airplanes. So
87.68s - 92.32s |  whatever you do, don't fly with me. It's really bad. Navigation, I also accidentally told air
92.32s - 96.56s |  traffic control that I was there when I was actually there. That caused a bit of a consternation
96.56s - 104.08s |  as well. But hey, fortunately for you, I never made it to commercial. I studied, but I never
104.08s - 109.60s |  made it to the airlines, which was a bit of a shame. So instead, back in 2002, I founded a pen
109.60s - 114.64s |  testing firm. But I do still fly in general aviation. And the sort of fun things I like flying.
115.28s - 120.56s |  My favorite airplane is the Piper Cherokee 6. I love it. I also went out to Eastern Europe to
120.56s - 126.08s |  learn to fly old Russian airliners, which are great fun. I fly multi-engine airplanes too.
126.08s - 132.00s |  But probably the scariest thing I ever did was flew into Courchevel-Alteport, which is in Courchevel
132.00s - 138.00s |  in France. It was built for the 1992 Olympics. And the runway is at an angle of 20 degrees.
139.04s - 144.32s |  If you come in and you get it wrong, basically you crash. You can't put the power on, go around
144.32s - 148.32s |  and try again because there's a mountain in the way. And often what happens, if you go to YouTube,
148.32s - 153.92s |  you'll see this, is people land with a bit too much speed and come screeching across the ramp,
154.56s - 159.44s |  brakes on fire and go plowing into the snowbank. There's a quite a recent one of a Piper Aztec
159.44s - 164.96s |  that went piling in. What they don't show you in the photograph is there is a bar right on the left
164.96s - 169.20s |  there with a viewing gallery and everyone sits there and waits for the airplanes to crash.
170.32s - 175.84s |  Amazingly, in the 30-something years it's been open, only two people have been very seriously
175.84s - 181.92s |  injured in that time. But they do have lots of crazy things. Anyway, I want to talk about what
181.92s - 188.24s |  I'm not. I am not an expert in GPS. It's not my field. I'm not a commercial pilot, fortunately
188.24s - 194.88s |  for you. But what I do want to talk about is a series of incidents that I've been told about that
194.88s - 201.52s |  have been published, some haven't, and I'm not going to give answers. What I think I would like
201.52s - 207.12s |  to stimulate from this is hopefully your interest in the space too. Go and start asking questions.
207.12s - 211.68s |  Go and start learning about GPS and go and learn about some of the interesting issues that we
211.68s - 218.64s |  started seeing over the last couple of years. So I spent a lot of time working in aviation.
218.64s - 222.00s |  I know quite a bit about flying airplanes. I know quite a bit of navigation systems.
222.56s - 226.24s |  I know quite a bit about the cyber security of airplanes too and I know lots of airlines. We're
226.24s - 232.40s |  on really good terms with all sorts. I also know about people and how pilots interact, how we
232.40s - 238.72s |  manage the cockpit resources and why things go wrong. I have this very weird fascination with
238.72s - 245.76s |  reading instant reports about aviation crashes. One thing I love more than anything about the
245.76s - 250.88s |  aviation industry, it is safe. And the reason it's safe is we find out what went wrong,
251.52s - 256.48s |  then we write it up without blame and we share it. Imagine if we could do that in the cyber
256.48s - 263.04s |  security industry, hey? That is why flying is so safe. Anyway, just before we go there,
263.68s - 268.80s |  it's really, really important. If you find vulnerabilities in aviation, you disclose
268.80s - 274.72s |  them responsibly and ethically. It takes a long time to fix things in airplanes. Why? Because we
274.72s - 280.64s |  need to be safe. You can't go and drop it like it's hot in aviation. You can't do 90 days Google
280.64s - 287.84s |  Project Zero style. Code in aviation has to be certified to make sure it's safe. You can't just
287.92s - 294.08s |  push a patch to a plane. It can take a couple of years to fix a vulnerability on an airplane.
294.08s - 299.44s |  And for those of you who've seen press reports about planes being hacked from a seat backing
299.44s - 304.64s |  coach, that doesn't work like that. You can't. The networks are segregated. They don't do that.
304.64s - 308.96s |  And there's always someone in control up front. When everything else goes wrong,
308.96s - 313.44s |  you've got pilots up there and that's what they're paid to do. They're paid to fly safely.
313.44s - 317.44s |  So a little bit of a recap. We need to go back to basics. We're going to go back to what I like to
317.44s - 323.12s |  think of a steam powered instance. One of the very earliest types of navigational aid was a
323.12s - 328.56s |  non-directional beacon. It's simply got an indicator in your cockpit that points at the
328.56s - 333.92s |  beacon. It's as simple as that. Very straightforward. Has very long range because it follows the
333.92s - 338.88s |  curvature of the earth. Unfortunately, there are some weaknesses, one of which being if you're
338.88s - 344.56s |  navigating in instrument conditions, so in cloud and there's thunderstorms going on, it'll point
344.56s - 348.40s |  at the thunderstorm. So you fly towards the thunderstorm instead of where you were hoping to
348.40s - 355.68s |  go. Very cheap to operate. And you often find them in very remote locations. So northern Canada,
355.68s - 360.32s |  there are still quite a lot of NDBs around because they've got great range, cheap to operate. And
360.32s - 364.24s |  there's not a huge amount of aviation traffic out there at low level. You do still find them.
364.24s - 368.56s |  They'll often be the markers or locators on an instrument landing system. So as you fly in,
368.56s - 371.76s |  if you listen to cockpit, you hear the outer marker, middle marker, inner marker.
373.89s - 382.13s |  Huge advances were made with the VOR. These came to be used in, I think, 1947 when they first emerged.
382.13s - 387.73s |  And they were not affected by the same issues with NDBs. They didn't point at thunderstorms
387.73s - 392.53s |  and make you fly into lightning, which is great. We like that. They're probably easier to use and
392.53s - 397.65s |  follow. And they're undoubtedly more accurate. But they are only line of sight. NDB follows the
397.65s - 404.69s |  curvature of the Earth. VOR, line of sight. And these are typically found at the intersections
404.69s - 409.97s |  of airways. When you're flying airway to airway, a turning point will often be accompanied by a
409.97s - 414.13s |  VOR on the ground. And if you're ever looking out of the window and you feel the airplane turn,
414.13s - 418.13s |  you might want to look down and you might just see this round thing on the ground. That's a VOR.
419.09s - 425.09s |  But they are expensive. They're expensive to maintain. And they don't give you altitude
425.09s - 434.53s |  information. They give you a direction. Whereas GPS gives you very precise points in space and
434.53s - 441.17s |  time. So because they're quite expensive to maintain, because we've got GPS, which is a lot
441.17s - 448.05s |  better, they're starting to be retired. They're starting to disappear. We also use DME, which is
448.05s - 452.13s |  essentially a bit like a submarine ping. You send a ping, get a response. Time of flight gives you
452.13s - 456.77s |  distance. And it's actually very accurate. We use DME typically on an instrument landing system
456.77s - 461.33s |  approach. At some point during that approach, we will check DME to make sure that we are the
461.33s - 468.45s |  correct distance from the runway. ILS. You've probably seen these. You see them at the end
468.45s - 475.41s |  of the runway. Yeah, that's the localizer. They're amazing bits of equipment. Incredibly precise,
475.97s - 480.37s |  given it's radio-based, and allows us to make an approach in what we call Cat 3C.
480.93s - 486.13s |  So completely fogged out, the airplane can still land safely with a combination of a
486.13s - 492.45s |  radio altimeter. The only minor issue with the instrument landing system is it can give false
492.45s - 501.01s |  glide slopes. So typically an ILS is aligned at a three degrees angle. And you'll also have
501.01s - 508.61s |  false signals at six degrees, multiples, nine degrees, 12, etc. So as a result of that, we always
508.61s - 516.29s |  used to approach the instrument landing system by flying under it. We'd intersect the glide
516.29s - 521.01s |  slope. And then we'd get clearance to descend. So we wouldn't typically approach from above,
521.01s - 526.21s |  because you might end up picking up one of the false GPS approaches. But they're really
526.21s - 530.69s |  expensive to maintain. They're incredibly expensive to build. And they're incredibly
530.69s - 534.53s |  expensive to maintain, because you have to calibrate them. And there's this incredible
534.53s - 539.89s |  process involving mirrors. So there'll be mirrors set up on the runway, and then you'll have a
539.89s - 543.97s |  calibration airplane will then fly down, signing lasers off the mirrors, and make sure it's
543.97s - 550.61s |  correctly calibrated. It's expensive. As a result of that, a lot of regional airports are starting
550.61s - 556.29s |  to retire their instrument landing systems. Why? Because we've got GPS. GPS is more accurate.
556.93s - 564.45s |  Fantastic. And you're starting to see LPV approaches take over where ILS was used
564.45s - 571.25s |  before. An example of that, so runway 19 right hand in Las Vegas itself is a GPS approach.
572.29s - 576.05s |  The other major runways still have instrument landing systems. But if you're approaching
576.05s - 583.57s |  from the north, you'll typically find a GPS based approach. We also use inertial reference.
584.13s - 590.77s |  So back in the day, when you were flying something like a 707, you had a navigator on board.
591.49s - 596.21s |  And that navigator would have had a sextant. And there was also a periscope in the roof,
596.21s - 601.65s |  like there is on the B-52. And they would literally do celestial sightings using a sextant
601.65s - 608.61s |  and work out where they are. Now we no longer have navigators. We don't really have that option.
608.61s - 612.45s |  So inertial reference was used, particularly where we're not flying over land, where we don't have
612.45s - 618.05s |  ground based beacons. And it means that simply relying on a very, very accurate accelerometer,
618.05s - 624.37s |  the one on the right is the inertial reference system from Concorde, gyro based. And the one
624.37s - 629.73s |  on the left is the much more recent version, which is laser based gyros. They are so accurate
630.45s - 636.13s |  that on a 3000 nautical mile flight from, say, London to New York, you could be as little as
636.13s - 641.65s |  one nautical mile off position, which is phenomenal advances, but actually not great
641.65s - 646.69s |  if you then want to approach and land. You need to be a bit better than one nautical mile away
646.69s - 654.13s |  from the runway. That'd be a bad day. So as we're starting to see conventional nav aids start to be
654.13s - 658.93s |  retired because they're expensive and not as accurate, we're starting to see them being
658.93s - 664.05s |  removed. And particularly the VORs that are off airway routes, they're being retired.
665.33s - 670.21s |  There's also a lot of VORs are still part of the approach. So for example, a standard approach
670.21s - 675.97s |  route or a standard instrument departure will often involve a VOR. One of my favourite,
675.97s - 681.49s |  why do I have a favourite VOR? I don't know. There's a proposal to recover a Delta Tango,
681.49s - 686.05s |  sorry, retired Delta Tango Yankee, which is a critical part or was a critical part of a number
686.05s - 693.94s |  of the standard approaches into London's Heathrow. 10 years ago, we had 44 VORs in the UK, we're now
693.94s - 703.06s |  down to below 19. So we're starting to rely increasingly on GPS. Now, let's look at some
703.06s - 708.10s |  of the incidents that we've stumbled onto. I would strongly recommend if you want to learn more about
708.10s - 712.50s |  this, go and follow the Ops Group, really interesting grouping, gathering data, have
712.50s - 718.74s |  real-time GPS spoofing and jamming reports. As I'm sure you've started to see, we're starting to see
719.46s - 725.22s |  position errors, particularly around areas of conflict. There's a lot going on in Eastern
725.22s - 730.02s |  Europe and Ukraine, obviously. And part of that, we believe, is there to mitigate drone-based
730.02s - 734.66s |  attacks. A lot of consumer drones rather than military drones being used, they rely on GPS in
734.66s - 742.18s |  some cases. So to mitigate an attack, you would jam or spoof GPS. We saw a lot of jamming and
742.18s - 747.06s |  spoofing going on in the Black Sea, but that was typically for shipping. So around military
747.06s - 751.54s |  installations in the Black Sea, you'd often get a 20 nautical mile position error when you were at
751.54s - 759.63s |  sea. It's increased massively, though. The last report I read had a 400% increase, which is huge.
759.63s - 765.87s |  We're seeing moves away from jamming towards position errors. Position can be incredibly
765.87s - 772.51s |  interesting. Now, for safety reasons, when we're approaching to land, we will have the ground
772.51s - 777.95s |  proximity warning system. So if we descend too low, or we start flying towards hills,
777.95s - 783.15s |  which would be really bad, the GPWS will give us a signal and say, too low, pull up. So we're, okay.
784.27s - 789.31s |  But if you've got a position error, you're flying down your ILS, the GPWS thinks you're
789.31s - 794.35s |  somewhere else because it's being spoofed and triggers. First thing you have to do is go around.
795.31s - 800.11s |  So we're seeing numerous flights have to go around and try again because they're getting
800.11s - 805.63s |  position errors that are triggering the ground proximity. We're also seeing some interesting
805.63s - 812.27s |  issues around poisoning. Now, inertial reference I mentioned there, it's not as accurate, right?
812.27s - 818.11s |  It's great, but it's not as accurate as GPS. So therefore we would deprecate to GPS as the most
818.11s - 824.75s |  accurate source of position and time on the airplane. So the RS will be updated by the GPS
824.75s - 829.23s |  pretty frequently. So when we start to see position errors, what we're then starting to see
829.23s - 836.19s |  is inertial reference then becomes poisoned by GPS. And one of the instructions to pilots is if
836.19s - 840.35s |  you are experiencing spoofing or likely to experience spoofing, you would then switch
840.35s - 848.62s |  from GPS to inertial reference so you don't see poisoning going on. We've seen anecdotal reports
848.62s - 857.58s |  pop up around airplanes not able to reacquire. You go into an area of spoofing, you lose GPS,
858.54s - 866.22s |  you then leave the area of spoofing and jamming some distance later. Now, in order to see the
866.22s - 869.74s |  satellites in the skies, you need to know where they are. And that's your satellite almanac, which
869.74s - 875.34s |  is part of a GPS system. The multimode receivers, which will gather that data, we've seen reports
876.30s - 881.02s |  where you get beyond the jamming area and the MMR can't now reacquire the signal because the
881.02s - 887.10s |  satellites aren't where it thinks they are. There have been all sorts of reports of coarse position
887.34s - 891.74s |  jamming causing problems around areas of perhaps what we might call hostile airspace,
892.46s - 897.34s |  places we wouldn't really want to fly into where maybe it's a war zone or an unfriendly hostile
897.34s - 902.86s |  nation. You do not want to be accidentally flying into their airspace. That reset process,
903.66s - 907.98s |  if they're no longer working, needs to be done on the ground so the planes are no longer moving,
907.98s - 913.82s |  it can reacquire correctly. Interestingly, more modern multimode receivers don't seem to be as
913.82s - 917.74s |  vulnerable. They seem to be better at reacquiring afterwards compared to some of the older multimode
917.74s - 921.74s |  receivers that are in slightly older airplanes. Really interesting. I haven't got to the bottom
921.74s - 929.98s |  of that. Now, when we do see GPS jamming and spoofing going on, there'll often be a notice
929.98s - 935.10s |  to airmen, a NOTAM. And that tells the pilots, look, you're really likely to receive some jamming
935.10s - 943.90s |  or spoofing problems there. So before you go there, switch. But remember, we're retiring
943.90s - 948.94s |  older base nav-aids. We're starting to retire our instrument landing systems in favour of GPS.
948.94s - 955.02s |  But now we've got position problems. There was a really interesting incident at Tartu airport in
955.02s - 959.58s |  Estonia. So Finnair suspended their flights. They were flying ATR-72s in there, I believe.
960.14s - 966.54s |  And they started to experience GPS spoofing and jamming and couldn't safely approach the airport.
966.54s - 971.34s |  So they suspended flights for a couple of months while they looked for other sources of data. And
971.34s - 976.06s |  they ended up settling back on distance measuring equipment to ensure that if they were spoofed,
976.06s - 981.02s |  they could correctly approach the airport. But we started to see these issues affecting real flights.
982.70s - 986.62s |  But where I really want to move on to is the concept of time. We think too much, to my mind,
986.62s - 993.82s |  about GPS being a source of position. But it's actually a source of time. We're starting to see
993.82s - 1000.22s |  reports of the clocks on board airplanes during spoofing events start to do weird things.
1001.18s - 1005.42s |  Initially, we were starting to see very minor errors. So maybe it would jump forward a minute
1005.42s - 1010.86s |  or so, maybe even go back. And in that situation, pilots were advised, it's part of their quick
1010.86s - 1015.58s |  reference handbook, to switch back to the local clock on the airplane rather than rely on the
1015.58s - 1024.46s |  GPS one that was doing weird things. This is an incident I was party to. The GPS time did
1024.46s - 1030.14s |  something really weird. It rolled forward a very large amount, not something that's been widely
1030.22s - 1034.94s |  seen. Because it happened quickly, the pilots weren't able to switch the local time, and it
1034.94s - 1039.02s |  caused a series of follow-up incidents. And you start to realize how important time is to an
1039.02s - 1047.02s |  airplane. It started to cause the digital certificates used for electronic communication
1047.02s - 1051.82s |  to become invalid. They weren't expired like we'd expect a certificate. They just weren't valid
1051.82s - 1055.58s |  because the time was too far in the future. One of the first effects, and you'll probably see this
1055.66s - 1059.58s |  as a passenger Wi-Fi might fail. Why? Because its digital certificates aren't valid anymore.
1060.22s - 1064.54s |  You then start to see issues around the cockpit, sorry, the controller to pilot
1064.54s - 1070.78s |  data link communication, which requires an accurate source of time. That's now not working,
1070.78s - 1077.18s |  so you're now back to VHF. Now, in this particular incident, the flight landed safely. Pilots asked
1077.18s - 1083.34s |  for radar vectors, and they landed fine. We expected them to land fine. That was not an issue.
1084.30s - 1088.94s |  But you see time being a really important component of other parts of the airplane
1088.94s - 1093.50s |  communications too. So TCAS, the Collision Avoidance Service, that's what stops airplanes
1093.50s - 1100.38s |  flying into each other. Great, we like that. The latest versions of TCAS allow for even
1102.22s - 1106.62s |  less spacing. So we can use airspace more efficiently, but it's still super, super safe
1106.62s - 1111.98s |  because we have GPS as precise sources of time. So we're starting to see TCAS causing issues.
1111.98s - 1117.42s |  Even something as simple as logging of incidents on an airplane. What do we need when we're
1117.42s - 1123.50s |  creating logs? An accurate source of time. So what is the authoritative source of time on board?
1123.50s - 1129.81s |  Well, what's the most accurate source of time? GPS. What was really interesting about this
1129.81s - 1136.37s |  incident was that the time can actually be quite hard to re-establish. Now, I've seen varying
1136.37s - 1141.65s |  reports. I've seen time go forward. I've heard about time going back as well. But in this
1141.65s - 1145.89s |  particular incident, there are protections in place to stop the time being rolled back.
1146.69s - 1149.57s |  Why would time go back? We wouldn't do that, would we?
1151.17s - 1156.77s |  But actually, we're not quite sure whether this is just this airplane, the type of airplane,
1156.77s - 1160.29s |  or even the manufacturer. We're not sure. There needs to be a lot more work done here. But
1161.01s - 1167.57s |  they couldn't roll the time back. There were protections in place to stop the time that
1167.57s - 1173.33s |  they'd go forward, but not back. And as a result, the airplane, most of the components on it,
1173.33s - 1177.81s |  had to be reflashed, which was a hugely expensive and time-consuming maintenance problem issue.
1179.57s - 1185.09s |  Cost directly, but most importantly, downtime on the airplane. It was down for a significant
1185.09s - 1188.93s |  period of time whilst everything was reflashed and time was brought back to normal.
1190.13s - 1195.73s |  Planes are very connected. Planes do lots of connectivity. Even something as simple as a
1195.73s - 1203.73s |  data loader requires a source of time. The SATCOMs require a source of time. Connectivity and safety
1203.73s - 1210.05s |  aboard airplanes needs the time to be right. So what do I take from this? Well, it's pretty
1210.05s - 1216.13s |  straightforward to spoof GPS. It's not that complicated. It doesn't require much power.
1216.13s - 1222.53s |  GPS is a very weak signal. A few watts will do it. It seems to be specific to some planes,
1223.49s - 1228.29s |  but I think more research is needed. And also, I think as engineers become more familiar with
1228.29s - 1234.45s |  the process, I think we'll see maintenance, for instance like this, become much less disruptive,
1234.45s - 1242.53s |  which I think is great. What is the future? Well, hybrid. Using GPS, but correlating it with
1242.53s - 1247.89s |  systems on the ground that we know about. There are already sources of information on the ground.
1247.89s - 1253.41s |  We've got existing nav aids on the ground that we can cross-check with to make sure that the
1253.41s - 1259.41s |  GPS position we're receiving, the GPS time we're receiving is correct. But we need to think
1259.41s - 1265.89s |  carefully about retiring all those existing steam-powered navigation aids that are on the
1265.89s - 1270.85s |  ground. Because if we get too excited about it, we're not going to have anything to be hybrid against.
1271.73s - 1278.29s |  Scary. Let's just put aviation aside for a moment. It's not just aviation that uses GPS.
1278.85s - 1282.61s |  Financial services need a really accurate source of time for high-frequency trading.
1282.61s - 1287.01s |  A lot of industrial control systems use GPS. There are lots of other areas where GPS is used
1287.01s - 1291.65s |  as a trusted source of time. And spoofing in financial services, I'm not quite sure how that
1291.65s - 1296.29s |  would work, because you've got a stationary target rather than something up there. But it does get
1297.09s - 1301.81s |  you thinking, doesn't it? It does let you realise how important time is. Now, there's some further
1301.81s - 1307.65s |  watching. I really want you to watch one of my colleagues in the aerospace village give a talk
1307.65s - 1312.21s |  a bit later on. He's talking about the world of PKI in airplanes. Really, really interesting and
1312.21s - 1315.33s |  very relevant to what we've been talking about today. It's going to be in Crater Stage 2 at
1315.33s - 1319.33s |  half past five down the way there. But that's me. I hope you found it interesting. I'd be glad to
1319.33s - 1322.13s |  take some questions if you want to come to the front. Thank you.
