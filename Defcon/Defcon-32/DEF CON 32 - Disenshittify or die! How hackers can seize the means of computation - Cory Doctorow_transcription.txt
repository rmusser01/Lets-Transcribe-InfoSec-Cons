  "description": "The enshittification of the internet wasn't inevitable. The old, good internet gave way to the enshitternet because we let our bosses enshittify it. We took away the constraints of competition, regulation, interop and tech worker power, and so when our bosses yanked on the big enshittification lever in the c-suite, it started to budge further and further, toward total enshittification. A new, good internet is possible - and necessary - and it needs you.",

 Hello, how are you?
2.68s - 4.32s |  Nice to see you.
4.32s - 7.52s |  Thank you to DEF CON, thank you especially to the goons
7.52s - 9.68s |  and the other volunteers who are out here
9.68s - 12.16s |  busting their humps so we can have such a great time.
12.16s - 14.36s |  And thank you all for coming.
14.36s - 16.52s |  I thought I had 50 minutes, I have 45.
16.52s - 19.80s |  I'm gonna talk fast and instead of Q&A,
19.80s - 21.80s |  there's a bookseller in the book signing areas
21.80s - 23.00s |  bringing in some of my books.
23.00s - 24.84s |  You don't have to buy a book, just come over and say hello.
24.84s - 27.68s |  I'm gonna sit there until everyone who's got a question
27.68s - 29.20s |  has had a chance to ask it.
29.20s - 32.64s |  So that's opposite the vendor area gates after this talk.
32.64s - 34.12s |  That's the housekeeping here.
34.12s - 36.08s |  So I wanna start by asking an important question
36.08s - 40.20s |  which is what the fuck happened to the old good internet?
40.20s - 45.20s |  I mean, our bosses were a little surveillance happy
45.24s - 47.80s |  and yeah, they were totally up for sharing their data
47.80s - 49.04s |  with the NSA.
49.04s - 52.24s |  And if there was ever a toss up between our user security
52.24s - 55.60s |  and growth, they always cashed out for YOLO.
55.60s - 58.76s |  But Google search, whatever else we could say about it,
58.80s - 60.32s |  it worked.
60.32s - 63.12s |  And Facebook actually used to give you a feed
63.12s - 66.56s |  that shows you the things that you asked to see.
66.56s - 69.84s |  Uber used to be cheaper than a taxi
69.84s - 73.60s |  and pay the drivers more than a cab driver.
73.60s - 77.12s |  Amazon used to actually sell products,
77.12s - 81.04s |  not this shine grade self-destructing drop ship garbage
81.04s - 82.52s |  from brands you've never heard of
82.52s - 87.92s |  whose names consist entirely of consonants.
87.92s - 89.84s |  Apple used to defend your privacy
89.84s - 91.80s |  rather than spying on you with a device
91.80s - 95.08s |  you're not allowed to modify to turn off the surveillance.
95.08s - 97.84s |  There was a time where if you search for an album
97.84s - 99.92s |  on Spotify, you'd find the album,
99.92s - 104.04s |  not a playlist with the same image and title as the album,
104.04s - 106.00s |  but which consists of a bunch of things
106.00s - 108.80s |  that someone paid to put in that playlist.
108.80s - 111.28s |  Microsoft used to sell you software.
111.28s - 113.40s |  Yeah, it was very buggy software,
113.40s - 115.20s |  but now they don't even do that.
115.20s - 117.28s |  They just let you access apps in the cloud
117.28s - 119.28s |  and they watch how you use those apps,
119.72s - 121.60s |  figure out which features you value the most,
121.60s - 122.84s |  pull them out of the basic rate
122.84s - 125.00s |  and sell them back to you as an upsell.
125.00s - 127.56s |  What, and I cannot stress this enough,
127.56s - 129.44s |  what the fuck happened?
130.36s - 134.08s |  So obviously I am talking about inshittification.
134.08s - 134.96s |  And from the outside,
134.96s - 137.16s |  here's what inshittification looks like.
137.16s - 139.92s |  First, you see a business that's being good to its end users.
139.92s - 142.48s |  You know, Google puts the best search results at the top.
142.48s - 143.92s |  Facebook shows you a feed of posts
143.92s - 145.52s |  from people you asked to follow.
145.52s - 147.76s |  Uber charges small dollars for a cab.
147.76s - 150.60s |  Amazon subsidizes goods and returns and shipping
150.60s - 152.84s |  and puts the best match for your product search
152.84s - 154.24s |  at the top of the search results.
154.24s - 156.12s |  And that's stage one.
156.12s - 158.60s |  That's the part where they're good to end users,
158.60s - 160.36s |  but there's a hidden part of stage one,
160.36s - 162.48s |  call it like stage 1A,
162.48s - 163.96s |  and that's the part where they're figuring out
163.96s - 166.44s |  how to lock in those users.
166.44s - 170.24s |  So if you're Facebook, the users just do it for you.
170.24s - 173.48s |  You joined Facebook because there were people on Facebook
173.48s - 175.08s |  you wanted to hang out with.
175.08s - 176.80s |  And other people, they joined Facebook
176.80s - 178.36s |  because they wanted to hang out with you.
178.36s - 181.60s |  That's those old network effects in action.
181.60s - 185.52s |  And with network effects come a collective action problem
185.52s - 187.12s |  because you love your friends,
187.12s - 189.56s |  but God damn, are they a pain in the ass.
189.56s - 191.88s |  Sure, you all agree that Facebook sucks,
191.88s - 194.36s |  but can you agree on when it's time to leave?
194.36s - 195.52s |  No way.
195.52s - 198.12s |  Can you agree on where to go if you're going to leave?
198.12s - 199.80s |  Hell no.
199.80s - 202.20s |  You're there because that's where the support group
202.20s - 203.96s |  for your rare disease is hanging out.
203.96s - 205.40s |  And your bestie is there
205.44s - 207.16s |  because that's where they talk with the people
207.16s - 209.32s |  in the country that they moved away from.
209.32s - 210.84s |  And then there's that friend who coordinates
210.84s - 213.40s |  their kids' Little League carpools on Facebook.
213.40s - 215.60s |  And the best dungeon master you know is there,
215.60s - 216.60s |  and she's not going to leave
216.60s - 218.52s |  because that's where her customers are.
218.52s - 221.04s |  So you're stuck because even though Facebook use
221.04s - 222.80s |  comes at a high cost to you,
222.80s - 225.72s |  your privacy, your dignity, your sanity,
225.72s - 227.52s |  it's still less than the switching cost
227.52s - 229.88s |  you'd have to endure if you went somewhere else.
229.88s - 232.40s |  All those friends who have taken you hostage,
232.40s - 235.68s |  and who you are also holding hostage.
235.68s - 238.84s |  Now, sometimes companies lock you in with money.
238.84s - 240.40s |  Amazon gets you to prepay
240.40s - 242.00s |  for a year's worth of shipping with Prime,
242.00s - 244.28s |  and they want to sell you your Audible audiobooks
244.28s - 245.88s |  on a monthly subscription,
245.88s - 247.48s |  which virtually guarantees
247.48s - 250.12s |  that every shopping expedition starts on Amazon
250.12s - 252.04s |  because you've already paid for the shipping.
252.04s - 254.36s |  Sometimes they lock you in with digital rights management,
254.36s - 256.52s |  like HP, who will sell you a printer
256.52s - 259.16s |  with four ink cartridges with fluid inside it
259.20s - 262.88s |  that retails for more than $10,000 a gallon.
262.88s - 265.92s |  So, and they use DRM to stop you
265.92s - 268.00s |  from refilling any of those cartridges
268.00s - 269.80s |  or using a third-party cart.
269.80s - 273.08s |  So when one cartridge runs dry, you have to refill it,
273.08s - 275.16s |  or you have to throw away the other three cartridges,
275.16s - 276.12s |  which are full of liquid
276.12s - 278.92s |  that costs more than vintage Veuve Clicquot.
278.92s - 282.16s |  Sometimes the vendor uses a grab bag of locked-in techniques
282.16s - 284.32s |  like you can't run an iOS app
284.32s - 286.12s |  unless you're using Apple hardware,
286.12s - 287.76s |  and you can't run the music, the books,
287.76s - 290.96s |  and the videos you bought from Apple, except in an iOS app.
295.10s - 296.54s |  That's a happy sound.
298.26s - 330.11s |  Can you?
330.11s - 331.11s |  Can we get this mic up?
331.11s - 332.15s |  Oh, here we are.
332.15s - 332.99s |  Great.
334.27s - 336.15s |  We have the technology.
336.15s - 338.79s |  Sometimes the vendor is doing this grab bag stuff
338.79s - 339.63s |  like Apple does.
339.63s - 341.83s |  So you need the Apple hardware to run the Apple apps.
341.83s - 344.15s |  You need the Apple apps to play the Apple media.
344.15s - 347.43s |  And then the phone itself, it uses parts pairing,
347.43s - 350.11s |  which is DRM handshakes between subcomponents
350.11s - 351.91s |  and the main computer and the device.
351.91s - 354.67s |  So you can't use third-party parts to fix it.
354.67s - 358.99s |  And every part in that device in your iPhone
358.99s - 362.83s |  has got a microscopic Apple logo engraved on it
362.83s - 365.35s |  so that if it gets broken up for parts in the Far East
365.35s - 366.75s |  and shipped back to the U.S.,
366.75s - 369.19s |  they can ask U.S. Customs and Border Patrol
369.19s - 372.07s |  to seize it at the border as a trademark violation.
372.07s - 374.19s |  That's some real thinking different.
374.19s - 376.03s |  So getting you locked in
376.03s - 379.55s |  completes phase one of the inshittification cycle
379.55s - 382.07s |  and heralds the beginning of stage two.
382.07s - 384.99s |  This is when things are made worse for you as an end user
384.99s - 387.47s |  in order to make things better for the business customers
387.47s - 388.95s |  that they're making money from.
388.95s - 392.47s |  So for example, platforms might poison their search results
392.47s - 394.51s |  like Google, which sells more and more
394.51s - 396.51s |  of that results page to ads
396.51s - 398.79s |  that are identified with smaller and smaller
398.79s - 402.27s |  and grayer and grayer type next to it that says ad.
402.27s - 405.43s |  Or Amazon, which sells off its search results
405.43s - 407.07s |  calling this an ad business.
407.07s - 409.71s |  They make $38 billion a year
409.71s - 412.03s |  selling search placement for your queries
412.03s - 415.11s |  so that the first result when you search Amazon on average
415.11s - 418.83s |  is 29% more expensive than the best results on Amazon.
418.83s - 421.79s |  The first row is 25% more expensive
421.79s - 423.27s |  than the best result on Amazon
423.27s - 425.35s |  and that best result is on average
425.35s - 429.51s |  17 places down on that search result page, right?
429.51s - 431.67s |  Or the vendor, they'll poison your feed
433.59s - 435.15s |  like Facebook, which started off
435.15s - 437.71s |  obviously showing you the things that you asked to see
437.71s - 439.87s |  but the quantum of content from the people
439.87s - 442.11s |  that you asked to hear from has dwindled
442.11s - 444.95s |  and dwindled to a kind of homeopathic residue
444.95s - 447.35s |  leaving behind a void that can be filled up
447.35s - 449.75s |  with things that people will pay to show you.
449.75s - 452.19s |  So a lot of that is ads, but a lot of it is boosted posts
452.19s - 455.31s |  from publishers that you haven't subscribed to.
455.31s - 457.67s |  Those publishers, they have to pay
457.67s - 459.67s |  because they can't reach their own subscribers
459.67s - 461.63s |  without paying to boost.
461.63s - 464.03s |  Now at this point, you might be thinking,
464.03s - 466.07s |  sure, if you're not paying for the product,
466.07s - 467.79s |  you're the product, but that is bullshit.
467.79s - 470.07s |  It is absolute bullshit.
470.07s - 471.87s |  The people who buy Google ads,
471.87s - 474.95s |  they pay more every year for worse targeting
474.95s - 476.63s |  and more ad fraud.
476.63s - 479.19s |  Like the publishers who are paying to reach you
479.19s - 480.99s |  even though you've subscribed to them.
480.99s - 483.75s |  The Amazon sellers with the best match for your query
483.75s - 485.55s |  have to outbid everyone else
485.55s - 487.31s |  just to be in the first page of results
487.31s - 490.35s |  and it costs so much to sell on Amazon,
490.35s - 494.83s |  41 to 51, 45 to 51% of the sale price
494.83s - 496.79s |  of everything that you buy on Amazon
496.79s - 499.03s |  is being scooped up by Don Bezos
499.03s - 500.91s |  and the Amazon crime family.
500.91s - 505.51s |  Those sellers, they do not have the margin
505.51s - 508.51s |  to kick up 45% to Amazon.
508.51s - 510.47s |  So they have to raise prices
510.47s - 512.43s |  in order to avoid losing money on every sale.
512.43s - 514.07s |  But wait, I hear you say.
515.63s - 517.43s |  But wait, I hear you say.
518.43s - 520.47s |  Things on Amazon aren't more expensive
520.47s - 523.07s |  than the things I buy at Target or Walmart
523.07s - 525.59s |  or my mom and pop store direct from the vendor.
525.59s - 528.23s |  How can they be raising prices on Amazon
528.23s - 529.79s |  if the price on Amazon is the same
529.79s - 530.71s |  as the price everywhere else?
530.71s - 532.95s |  Does anyone want to guess how that works?
534.27s - 537.03s |  They raise the prices everywhere else
537.03s - 539.35s |  because Amazon binds their sellers
539.35s - 542.67s |  to a policy called most favored nation status,
542.67s - 544.75s |  which means that the cheapest price they offer
544.75s - 546.87s |  has to be matched on Amazon.
546.99s - 550.15s |  So they sell more, they charge more everywhere.
550.15s - 553.83s |  Now, these sellers are Amazon's best customers.
553.83s - 555.27s |  They are paying for the product
555.27s - 557.55s |  and they are still getting screwed.
557.55s - 559.63s |  Paying for the product does not fill
559.63s - 562.99s |  your vapid boss's shriveled heart with so much joy
562.99s - 564.99s |  that he decides to stop trying to think of ways
564.99s - 567.03s |  to fuck you over.
567.03s - 568.27s |  Look at Apple.
568.27s - 571.07s |  Remember when Apple offered every iOS user
571.07s - 573.71s |  a one-click opt-out for app-based surveillance
573.71s - 578.11s |  and 96% of iOS users ticked that box,
578.11s - 583.11s |  the other 4% being drunk, confused or Facebook employees?
583.15s - 586.51s |  I mean, this cost Apple 10 billion
586.51s - 589.39s |  or it cost Facebook $10 billion in the first year alone
589.39s - 590.83s |  and we love to see it,
590.83s - 593.95s |  but did you know that at the same time,
593.95s - 596.75s |  Apple turned on iOS spying
596.75s - 600.11s |  that gathered exactly the same data on iOS users
600.11s - 602.51s |  for exactly the same purpose for ad targeting
602.55s - 604.15s |  for its own ad network
604.15s - 606.15s |  and did not give them any way to opt out
606.15s - 607.79s |  and lied about it.
608.83s - 612.55s |  Now, your iPhone is not an ad-supported gimme.
612.55s - 614.63s |  You paid a thousand fucking dollars
614.63s - 616.99s |  for that distraction rectangle in your pocket
616.99s - 619.47s |  and you are still the product.
619.47s - 622.55s |  What's more, Apple has rigged iOS
622.55s - 626.27s |  so that you can't mod the OS to block that spying.
626.27s - 627.71s |  If you're not paying for the product,
627.71s - 629.11s |  yeah, you're the product,
629.11s - 630.91s |  but if you are paying for the product,
630.91s - 633.39s |  you are still the product.
633.39s - 636.07s |  Just ask farmers who shell out six figures
636.07s - 637.95s |  for mission-critical tractors,
637.95s - 640.39s |  but can't actually use their tractors
640.39s - 643.03s |  when they swap parts into them after they break down
643.03s - 645.59s |  until the manufacturer charges them 200 bucks
645.59s - 647.87s |  to send a guy to the end of a lonely country road
647.87s - 650.23s |  and type an unlock code into the console.
650.23s - 652.71s |  John Deere is not giving away tractors.
652.71s - 655.03s |  Give John Deere half million for a tractor
655.03s - 656.91s |  and you will be the product.
656.91s - 659.91s |  Please, I'm begging you, my brothers and sisters in Christ,
659.91s - 662.59s |  please stop saying, if you're not paying for the product,
662.59s - 664.03s |  you're the product.
664.03s - 666.99s |  Okay, so that is phase two of inshitification.
666.99s - 670.07s |  Phase one, be good to your users, but lock them in.
670.07s - 672.15s |  Phase two, screw those users a little
672.15s - 673.71s |  so you can be good to business customers
673.71s - 676.27s |  while locking them in because they need those users.
676.27s - 679.03s |  Then phase three, screw everybody
679.03s - 681.15s |  and take all the value for yourself.
681.15s - 684.47s |  Leave behind the absolute bare minimum of utility
684.47s - 687.23s |  so that everyone stays locked into this pile of shit.
687.23s - 690.91s |  Inshitification, a tragedy in three acts.
690.91s - 694.07s |  So that is what inshitification looks like from the outside.
694.07s - 696.59s |  But what is going on inside the company?
696.59s - 699.71s |  What is the pathological mechanism?
699.71s - 702.91s |  What sci-fi entropy rate are our bosses aiming
702.91s - 706.11s |  at these products to make them so bad so quickly?
706.11s - 709.59s |  Well, I call that mechanism twiddling.
709.59s - 712.47s |  Twiddling is when someone is altering the backend
712.47s - 715.07s |  of a service to change its business operations,
715.07s - 718.55s |  to change its prices, its costs, its search ranking,
718.55s - 720.43s |  its recommendation criteria,
720.43s - 723.99s |  and other foundational aspects of the system.
723.99s - 727.47s |  Digital platforms are a twiddler's utopia.
727.47s - 730.75s |  A grocer would need an army of teenagers
730.75s - 733.15s |  with pricing guns on rollerblades
733.15s - 734.67s |  to reprice everything in the store
734.67s - 737.51s |  if someone comes in who looks like they're feeling spendy.
737.51s - 740.11s |  But McDonald's Investments has a portfolio company
740.11s - 742.55s |  called Plexure, and they advertise
742.55s - 744.45s |  that they can use surveillance data
744.49s - 746.97s |  to figure out when a customer has just been paid
746.97s - 749.97s |  and add three bucks to the price of the breakfast sandwich.
751.09s - 753.89s |  And of course, as the prophet William Gibson told us,
753.89s - 756.13s |  cyberspace is everting.
756.13s - 757.77s |  With digital shelf tags,
757.77s - 760.41s |  grocers can twiddle prices in real time,
760.41s - 761.97s |  like the grocers in Norway,
761.97s - 765.57s |  where they're adding these e-ink grocery shelf tags
765.57s - 769.41s |  and changing prices up to 2,000 times a day.
769.41s - 771.61s |  Now, it's not just grocery stores.
771.61s - 774.69s |  Every Uber driver gets offered a different wage
774.69s - 776.07s |  for every job.
776.07s - 779.49s |  If the driver's been picky lately, the job pays more.
779.49s - 781.17s |  But if the driver's been desperate enough
781.17s - 785.13s |  to grab every job that the app is offering,
785.13s - 787.97s |  the pay goes down and down and down.
787.97s - 789.77s |  The law professor, Veena Dubal,
789.77s - 792.89s |  calls this algorithmic wage discrimination,
792.89s - 795.01s |  and it's a prime example of twiddling.
795.01s - 797.37s |  And every YouTuber, every TikToker,
797.37s - 799.39s |  they know what it's like to be twiddled.
799.43s - 801.95s |  You spend weeks or months working on a video,
801.95s - 803.79s |  you spend thousands of dollars,
803.79s - 806.11s |  and then the algorithm decides that no one,
806.11s - 807.89s |  not even your subscribers,
807.89s - 810.67s |  not searchers who type in the name of the video,
810.67s - 812.71s |  will actually see that video.
812.71s - 813.55s |  Why?
813.55s - 814.55s |  Who knows?
814.55s - 817.19s |  The algorithm's rules are not public
817.19s - 821.03s |  because content moderation is the only security discipline
821.03s - 822.15s |  in which we still say
822.15s - 824.31s |  that there is security through obscurity.
824.31s - 826.79s |  We can't tell you how the Como algorithm works,
826.79s - 829.09s |  otherwise you might figure out how to cheat.
829.79s - 831.85s |  YouTube, in other words, is the kind of shitty boss
831.85s - 834.89s |  who docks your paycheck every week for violating rules,
834.89s - 836.73s |  but won't tell you what those rules are
836.73s - 838.71s |  in case you figure out how to break them next week
838.71s - 841.29s |  without him docking your paycheck.
841.29s - 844.65s |  Now, twiddling also works in some users' favor, of course.
844.65s - 847.49s |  Sometimes platforms twiddle things to make things better
847.49s - 850.53s |  for some of their end users or business customers.
850.53s - 852.57s |  So the best example I know about this
852.57s - 855.29s |  comes from the Forbes journalist Emily Baker White,
855.29s - 857.69s |  who broke a story about how TikTok
857.69s - 859.05s |  has a feature on its backend
859.05s - 860.97s |  that its strategic managers can use
860.97s - 862.61s |  called the heating tool.
862.61s - 864.61s |  When a manager applies the heating tool
864.61s - 866.17s |  to a performer's account,
866.17s - 868.03s |  that performer's videos are thrust
868.03s - 871.09s |  into the feeds of millions of users
871.09s - 872.41s |  without regard to whether or not
872.41s - 874.41s |  the recommendation algorithm
874.41s - 878.15s |  would organically recommend that to those viewers.
878.15s - 879.65s |  Now, why would they do that?
879.65s - 883.09s |  Here's an analogy from my Dewey boyhood
883.09s - 884.97s |  growing up in Toronto.
884.97s - 886.09s |  There was a traveling fare
886.09s - 887.53s |  that used to come to Toronto every summer
888.37s - 889.71s |  called the Canadian National Exhibition.
889.71s - 891.97s |  And if you've been to a fare like the X,
891.97s - 895.21s |  you know that you always spot some guy on the midway
895.21s - 897.85s |  lugging around a giant teddy bear.
897.85s - 899.55s |  Nominally, you win those teddy bears
899.55s - 901.73s |  by getting five balls in a peach basket.
901.73s - 903.21s |  But to a first approximation,
903.21s - 907.21s |  no one has ever gotten five balls in a peach basket.
907.21s - 909.21s |  That guy won his teddy bear
909.21s - 910.99s |  because a carny gestured at him and said,
910.99s - 912.09s |  "'Fella, I like your face.
912.09s - 913.83s |  "'I tell you what I'm gonna do.
913.83s - 915.77s |  "'You get just one ball in that peach basket.
915.77s - 917.01s |  "'I'll give you a key chain.
917.03s - 918.07s |  "'You got two key chains.
918.07s - 920.05s |  "'I'll let you trade up to the teddy bear.'"
920.05s - 921.97s |  That is how that guy got the teddy bear,
921.97s - 925.69s |  which he is now doomed to drag up and down the midway
925.69s - 927.21s |  all goddamn day.
927.21s - 929.97s |  Now, why did the carny give away the teddy bear?
929.97s - 932.57s |  Because it turned that guy into a walking billboard
932.57s - 933.85s |  for the midway games.
933.85s - 936.61s |  If that dopey looking Judas goat
936.61s - 938.21s |  can win a giant teddy bear,
938.21s - 940.37s |  then maybe you can too,
940.37s - 941.93s |  except you can't.
941.93s - 944.49s |  TikTok's heating tool is a way to give away
944.49s - 947.37s |  extremely tactical giant teddy bears.
947.37s - 949.73s |  When someone at the TikTok brain trust
949.73s - 952.61s |  decides they need more sports bros on the platform,
952.61s - 954.29s |  they pick out one bro at random
954.29s - 955.93s |  and they make him king for the day.
955.93s - 958.13s |  They heat the shit out of his account.
958.13s - 959.93s |  That guy gets a bazillion views
959.93s - 962.57s |  and he starts running around in all the sports bro forums,
962.57s - 963.71s |  trumpeting his success.
963.71s - 967.65s |  I am the Louis Pasteur of online sports bro content.
968.81s - 970.65s |  The other sports bros pile in
970.65s - 972.93s |  and they start retooling to make video
972.93s - 976.81s |  that complies with the idiosyncratic requirements of TikTok.
976.81s - 979.49s |  And when they fail to get giant teddy bears of their own,
979.49s - 982.41s |  they assume it's because they're doing TikTok wrong
982.41s - 985.05s |  because they don't know about the heating tool.
985.05s - 987.97s |  But then comes the day when the TikTok star chamber
987.97s - 991.09s |  decides that they've got enough sports bros on the platform
991.09s - 993.89s |  so they take the heat off that one lucky sports bro
993.89s - 996.93s |  and maybe they start heating up some lucky astrologer.
996.93s - 999.41s |  Giant teddy bears are all over the place.
999.41s - 1001.29s |  Those Uber drivers who the New York Times
1001.29s - 1002.93s |  lavished so much ink on
1002.93s - 1005.97s |  who are making $100,000 a year driving for Uber
1005.97s - 1008.57s |  or the sub stackers who are rolling in dough
1008.57s - 1012.17s |  or Joe Rogan's $100 million Spotify play out.
1012.17s - 1015.37s |  Those are all people who are the unwitting recipients
1015.37s - 1016.81s |  of giant teddy bears.
1016.81s - 1019.45s |  And those giant teddy bears are a goddamn bargain
1019.45s - 1022.73s |  because every dollar you spend on a giant teddy bear
1022.73s - 1025.49s |  turns into five or $10 worth of free labor
1025.49s - 1027.05s |  from people who think that they have a shot
1027.05s - 1028.89s |  of earning one of their own.
1028.89s - 1030.49s |  Now, platforms can play games
1030.49s - 1032.45s |  with every part of their business logic
1032.45s - 1034.33s |  in highly automated ways.
1034.33s - 1036.29s |  That allows them to quickly and efficiently
1036.29s - 1038.25s |  siphon value from end users
1038.25s - 1039.77s |  and give it to business customers
1039.77s - 1042.05s |  from business customers back to end users.
1042.05s - 1043.49s |  And then back again,
1043.49s - 1047.57s |  hiding the P in the shell game at machine speeds
1047.57s - 1049.89s |  until they've got everyone so turned around
1049.89s - 1052.17s |  that they can take all the value, excuse me,
1052.17s - 1054.67s |  they can take all the value for themselves.
1054.67s - 1056.17s |  That's the how.
1056.17s - 1057.85s |  How the platforms do that trick
1057.85s - 1059.45s |  where they're good to users,
1059.45s - 1061.09s |  then they lock those users in,
1061.09s - 1062.85s |  then they take something away from those users
1062.85s - 1065.33s |  and give it to business customers and lock them in.
1065.33s - 1067.17s |  And then they take the value for themselves.
1067.17s - 1069.33s |  So now we know what is happening.
1069.33s - 1071.45s |  We know how it's happening.
1071.45s - 1074.01s |  All that's left is why is it happening?
1074.01s - 1074.85s |  Now, on the one hand,
1074.85s - 1076.01s |  there's an answer to this question
1076.01s - 1077.61s |  that's pretty goddamn obvious.
1077.61s - 1080.29s |  The less value that a business gives to its suppliers,
1080.29s - 1081.89s |  its customers, its workers,
1081.89s - 1084.09s |  the more value there is left to divide
1084.09s - 1086.21s |  among the executives and the shareholders.
1086.21s - 1090.93s |  Companies, but that why doesn't tell you why now.
1090.93s - 1092.97s |  After all, companies could have done this shit
1092.97s - 1095.17s |  any time over the last 20 years,
1095.17s - 1096.41s |  but by and large, they didn't.
1096.41s - 1098.17s |  And when they did,
1098.17s - 1099.81s |  they turned themselves into piles of shit
1099.81s - 1101.91s |  and they got treated like piles of shit.
1101.91s - 1104.07s |  We avoided them and then they died.
1104.07s - 1108.13s |  Remember MySpace or Yahoo search or LiveJournal?
1108.13s - 1110.33s |  I mean, yeah, you can go to those domains today
1110.33s - 1113.07s |  and find a bunch of AI slop and programmatic ads,
1113.07s - 1115.17s |  but those sites are gone.
1115.17s - 1116.85s |  And there's the clue.
1116.85s - 1119.97s |  It used to be that if you and shitified your product,
1119.97s - 1122.77s |  bad things happen to your company.
1122.77s - 1126.05s |  Now, there are no consequences for in shitification,
1126.05s - 1128.91s |  which is why everyone is doing it right now.
1128.91s - 1130.61s |  So I'll break that down.
1130.61s - 1134.53s |  There are four forces that discipline technology companies.
1134.53s - 1136.97s |  The first one is obviously competition.
1136.97s - 1139.29s |  If your customers find it easy to leave,
1139.29s - 1141.37s |  then you have to worry about them leaving.
1141.37s - 1144.51s |  Now, many factors can contribute to how hard or easy it is
1144.51s - 1145.81s |  to depart a platform.
1146.79s - 1149.47s |  Think of the network effects that Facebook has going for it
1149.47s - 1151.47s |  and the intrinsic cost of going somewhere else
1151.47s - 1154.07s |  and leaving behind the people that you love there.
1154.07s - 1155.47s |  But the most important factor
1155.47s - 1156.87s |  on whether you can leave a platform
1156.87s - 1159.55s |  is whether there's somewhere else to go.
1159.55s - 1161.67s |  Now, remember 2012,
1161.67s - 1165.19s |  Facebook bought Instagram for a billion dollars.
1165.19s - 1166.81s |  Now that might seem like chump change
1166.81s - 1169.81s |  in these days of 11 digit big tech acquisitions,
1169.81s - 1172.79s |  but that was a big sum in those innocent days.
1172.83s - 1176.11s |  And it was an especially big sum to pay for Insta.
1176.11s - 1178.83s |  The company had 13 employees,
1178.83s - 1182.03s |  a mere 25 million registered users.
1182.03s - 1183.75s |  But what mattered to Zuck
1183.75s - 1186.03s |  wasn't how many users Insta had,
1186.03s - 1187.65s |  it's where those users came from.
1187.65s - 1190.83s |  Does anyone know where those Insta users were coming from?
1190.83s - 1194.59s |  Facebook, they were leaving Facebook and joining Insta.
1194.59s - 1195.91s |  They were sick of Facebook,
1195.91s - 1197.67s |  even though they liked the people there,
1197.67s - 1200.75s |  they hated creepy Zuck, they hated the platform,
1200.75s - 1202.91s |  and so they left and they didn't come back.
1202.91s - 1206.91s |  So Zuck spent a billion dollars to recapture them.
1206.91s - 1209.31s |  A fact that he put in writing
1209.31s - 1213.43s |  in a midnight email to his CFO, David Ebersman,
1213.43s - 1215.79s |  explaining that he was paying over the odds
1215.79s - 1219.15s |  because his users hated him and they loved Insta.
1219.15s - 1221.59s |  So even if they quit Facebook, the platform,
1221.59s - 1224.83s |  they would still be captured by Facebook, the company.
1224.83s - 1228.11s |  Now on paper, that acquisition is illegal.
1228.11s - 1230.13s |  Normally that'd be hard to prove
1230.13s - 1232.35s |  because you'd have to prove that Zuck bought them
1232.35s - 1234.81s |  for an anti-competitive purpose.
1234.81s - 1237.49s |  But in this case, Zuck just tripped over his own deck.
1237.49s - 1240.35s |  He actually put it in writing.
1240.35s - 1243.45s |  But Obama's DOJ and Federal Trade Commission,
1243.45s - 1244.81s |  they let it slide.
1244.81s - 1247.73s |  They were following the pro-monopoly policies
1247.73s - 1251.57s |  of Reagan, Bush One, Clinton, and Bush Two,
1251.57s - 1254.41s |  set an example that Trump would follow,
1254.41s - 1255.77s |  greenlighting giga-mergers
1255.77s - 1259.47s |  like the catastrophic, incestuous Warner Discovery merger
1259.51s - 1260.75s |  that as of this week,
1260.75s - 1265.47s |  restated its value down by $10 billion over one year.
1265.47s - 1267.07s |  Indeed, for 40 years,
1267.07s - 1269.83s |  starting with Carter and accelerating through Reagan,
1269.83s - 1273.15s |  the U.S. has encouraged monopoly formation
1273.15s - 1274.89s |  as an official policy
1274.89s - 1277.73s |  on the grounds that monopolies are efficient.
1277.73s - 1279.73s |  If everyone is using Google Search,
1279.73s - 1281.51s |  that's something we should celebrate.
1281.51s - 1283.87s |  It means they've got the very best search.
1283.87s - 1287.59s |  And wouldn't it be perverse to spend public funds
1287.59s - 1290.99s |  to punish them for making the best product?
1290.99s - 1292.63s |  But as we all know,
1292.63s - 1296.11s |  Google Search did not maintain dominance by being best.
1296.11s - 1298.75s |  They did it by paying bribes.
1298.75s - 1302.11s |  They spend more than $20 billion a year on Apple
1302.11s - 1304.79s |  to be the default iOS search.
1304.79s - 1308.23s |  They spend billions more to be defaults at Samsung, Mozilla,
1308.23s - 1310.03s |  and anyone else making a product
1310.03s - 1311.99s |  or a service with a search box,
1311.99s - 1314.39s |  ensuring that you never stumble on a search engine
1314.39s - 1316.39s |  that's any better than theirs.
1317.27s - 1320.19s |  Which in turn ensures that no one will ever invest
1320.19s - 1321.83s |  in a superior search engine,
1321.83s - 1324.27s |  even if they are visibly, obviously superior,
1324.27s - 1326.79s |  because why bother making something better
1326.79s - 1328.85s |  if Google's buying up all the market oxygen
1328.85s - 1331.33s |  before it can kindle a product to life?
1331.33s - 1333.69s |  Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon,
1333.69s - 1335.29s |  they are not making things companies,
1335.29s - 1337.31s |  they are buying things companies.
1337.31s - 1340.03s |  They take advantage of official tolerance
1340.03s - 1342.27s |  for anti-competitive acquisitions,
1342.27s - 1345.87s |  predatory pricing, market-distorting exclusivity deals,
1345.91s - 1348.79s |  and other acts specifically prohibited
1348.79s - 1350.91s |  by our antitrust laws.
1350.91s - 1352.69s |  They become too big to fail
1352.69s - 1354.63s |  because that makes them too big to jail,
1354.63s - 1356.99s |  and then they become too big to care,
1356.99s - 1359.63s |  which is why Google Search is a pile of shit,
1359.63s - 1362.15s |  and everything on Amazon is dropship garbage
1362.15s - 1364.19s |  that instantly disintegrates into a cloud
1364.19s - 1366.23s |  of off-gas, volatile, organic compounds
1366.23s - 1367.43s |  when you open the box.
1368.99s - 1371.67s |  Once companies no longer fear losing your business
1371.67s - 1373.67s |  to a competitor, it is much easier for them
1373.67s - 1376.27s |  to treat you badly because what are you going to do?
1376.27s - 1378.99s |  Remember when Lily Tomlin would be Ernestine,
1378.99s - 1381.35s |  the AT&T operator on those SNL sketches
1381.35s - 1383.07s |  where she'd do ads for the Bell system,
1383.07s - 1386.37s |  and they'd end with, we don't care, we don't have to,
1386.37s - 1388.71s |  we're the phone company.
1388.71s - 1390.55s |  Competition is the first force
1390.55s - 1392.43s |  that serves to discipline companies
1392.43s - 1395.63s |  and the insidificatory impulses of their leadership,
1395.63s - 1399.67s |  and 40 years ago, we stopped enforcing the competition law.
1399.67s - 1403.87s |  Now, it takes an especially smooth-brained type of asshole,
1403.87s - 1406.19s |  that is, an establishment economist,
1406.19s - 1409.59s |  to insist that the collapse of every single industry
1409.59s - 1411.67s |  from eyeglasses to vitamin C
1411.67s - 1413.99s |  into a cartel of five or fewer companies
1413.99s - 1416.47s |  has nothing to do with the policies that we embraced
1416.47s - 1419.19s |  that deliberately encouraged monopoly formation.
1419.19s - 1421.19s |  It's like we used to put down rat poison,
1421.19s - 1422.71s |  and we didn't have a rat problem,
1422.71s - 1424.33s |  and then these dickheads convinced us
1424.33s - 1427.93s |  to stop putting poison down because rats are good for us.
1427.93s - 1429.47s |  We stopped putting the poison down,
1430.27s - 1431.55s |  and now rats are eating our faces,
1431.55s - 1433.07s |  and they're all running around saying,
1433.07s - 1435.79s |  who's to say where all the rats are coming from?
1435.79s - 1438.39s |  Maybe it's because we stopped putting down rat poison,
1438.39s - 1441.51s |  but maybe it's just the time of the rats.
1441.51s - 1444.63s |  The great forces of history are bearing down on this moment
1444.63s - 1446.91s |  to multiply rats beyond all measure,
1446.91s - 1449.87s |  and nothing we can do would stop that.
1449.87s - 1452.29s |  Antitrust did not slip down a staircase
1452.29s - 1455.39s |  and fall back first onto a stiletto.
1455.39s - 1458.15s |  They stabbed it in the back, and then they pushed it,
1458.15s - 1459.59s |  and when they killed antitrust,
1459.59s - 1461.91s |  they killed all hope of regulation.
1461.91s - 1465.71s |  Regulation is the second force that disciplines companies.
1465.71s - 1467.99s |  Regulation is possible,
1467.99s - 1470.47s |  but only when the regulator is more powerful
1470.47s - 1472.81s |  than the entities that it regulates.
1472.81s - 1475.55s |  When a company is bigger than the government,
1475.55s - 1477.99s |  it gets damned hard to credibly threaten them
1479.15s - 1481.67s |  no matter what crimes they're committing.
1481.67s - 1484.23s |  That's what protected IBM for all those years
1484.23s - 1485.67s |  when it had its boot on the throat
1485.67s - 1487.55s |  of the American tech industry.
1487.55s - 1490.75s |  Do you know that the DOJ fought an antitrust case
1490.75s - 1494.07s |  against IBM from 1970 to 1982?
1494.07s - 1496.39s |  They called it Antitrust Vietnam,
1496.39s - 1499.23s |  and that every year for 12 consecutive years,
1499.23s - 1501.03s |  IBM spent more on lawyers
1501.03s - 1503.73s |  to fight the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division
1503.73s - 1504.99s |  than all the lawyers
1504.99s - 1507.45s |  the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division paid
1507.45s - 1511.91s |  to fight all the cases in America, 12 consecutive years,
1511.91s - 1515.27s |  and that paid off because by 1982,
1515.27s - 1516.87s |  the president was Ronald Reagan,
1516.91s - 1518.27s |  a man whose official policy
1518.27s - 1520.03s |  was that monopolies were efficient,
1520.03s - 1521.31s |  and he dropped the case,
1521.31s - 1523.91s |  and Big Blue wriggled off the hook.
1523.91s - 1526.03s |  It's hard to regulate a monopolist.
1526.03s - 1528.43s |  It's hard to regulate a cartel.
1528.43s - 1530.61s |  When a sector is composed of hundreds
1530.61s - 1533.75s |  of competing companies, well, they compete.
1533.75s - 1535.59s |  They genuinely fight with one another.
1535.59s - 1537.79s |  They're trying to poach each other's customers,
1537.79s - 1540.07s |  suppliers, and key employees.
1540.07s - 1542.07s |  They are at each other's throats.
1542.07s - 1545.39s |  It's hard enough to get a couple of hundred executives
1545.39s - 1546.95s |  to agree on anything,
1546.95s - 1549.63s |  but when they're legitimately competing with one another,
1549.63s - 1552.59s |  really obsessing about how to eat each other's lunches,
1552.59s - 1554.83s |  they can't agree on anything.
1554.83s - 1556.79s |  The second one of them goes to a regulator
1556.79s - 1558.51s |  with some bullshit story
1558.51s - 1561.35s |  about how it's impossible to build a decent search engine
1561.35s - 1563.11s |  without fine-grained surveillance,
1563.11s - 1564.55s |  or impossible to have a secure
1564.55s - 1566.31s |  and easy-to-use operating system
1566.31s - 1569.27s |  without giving a veto to the vendor
1569.27s - 1570.75s |  about which apps you run,
1570.75s - 1573.87s |  or how it's impossible to administer an ISP
1573.87s - 1575.95s |  unless you slow down connections to servers
1575.95s - 1578.07s |  that haven't paid for premium carriage,
1578.07s - 1579.91s |  there's going to be some other company saying,
1579.91s - 1581.35s |  no, that's bullshit.
1581.35s - 1582.27s |  We managed it.
1582.27s - 1583.15s |  Here's our logs.
1583.15s - 1584.67s |  Here's our quarterly cashbooks,
1584.67s - 1586.23s |  and here's our customer testimonials,
1586.23s - 1588.95s |  and they prove that these guys are lying.
1588.95s - 1591.05s |  A hundred companies are a rabble.
1591.05s - 1592.11s |  They are a mob.
1592.11s - 1594.05s |  They can't agree on a lobbying position.
1594.05s - 1596.31s |  They're too busy eating each other's lunch
1596.31s - 1598.23s |  to figure out how to cater a meeting
1598.23s - 1601.11s |  where they would discuss a common lobbying position.
1601.11s - 1604.67s |  But let those hundred companies merge to monopoly.
1604.67s - 1608.27s |  Let them absorb one another in an incestuous orgy,
1608.27s - 1610.75s |  turn into five giant companies so inbred
1610.75s - 1613.23s |  they get corporate Habsburg Jaws,
1613.23s - 1616.19s |  and they will become a cartel.
1616.19s - 1618.03s |  And it's easy for a cartel to agree
1618.03s - 1620.57s |  on what bullshit they're going to tell their regulators,
1620.57s - 1623.27s |  and to mobilize some of those excess billions
1623.27s - 1625.27s |  that they've reaped through consolidation,
1625.27s - 1627.99s |  which freed them from wasteful competition
1627.99s - 1631.15s |  so that they can capture their regulators completely.
1631.15s - 1633.11s |  You know, Congress used to pass
1633.11s - 1634.79s |  consumer federal privacy laws
1634.79s - 1636.77s |  whenever we got a new technology.
1636.77s - 1637.99s |  Not anymore.
1637.99s - 1640.07s |  The last time Congress managed to sit down
1640.07s - 1642.61s |  and pass a federal consumer privacy law in this country
1642.61s - 1647.31s |  was 1988, the Video Privacy Protection Act.
1647.31s - 1649.81s |  It bans video store clerks from telling newspapers
1649.81s - 1652.19s |  which VHS cassettes you took home.
1652.19s - 1654.01s |  In other words, it regulates three things
1654.01s - 1655.85s |  that no longer exist.
1656.85s - 1659.33s |  The threat of having your video rental history
1659.33s - 1661.85s |  out there in the public eye was not the last
1661.85s - 1663.69s |  or the most important privacy threat
1663.69s - 1665.65s |  we have faced since 1988,
1665.65s - 1668.11s |  and yet Congress has completely failed
1668.11s - 1669.41s |  to pass a privacy law.
1670.27s - 1673.21s |  Tech companies' regulatory capture
1673.21s - 1675.85s |  involves a risible and transparent gambit
1675.85s - 1677.75s |  that is so stupid it's an insult
1677.75s - 1679.81s |  to all those risible, transparent gambits
1679.81s - 1682.43s |  working so hard out there in the world every day.
1682.43s - 1683.83s |  That gambit is that they claim
1683.83s - 1685.61s |  that when they violate your consumer,
1686.37s - 1687.63s |  your privacy, or your labor rights,
1687.63s - 1690.65s |  that it's not a crime because they did it with an app.
1690.65s - 1693.29s |  Algorithmic wage discrimination is not wage theft.
1693.29s - 1694.53s |  We did it with an app.
1695.53s - 1697.67s |  Spying on you from asshole to appetite,
1697.67s - 1699.25s |  not a privacy violation.
1699.25s - 1700.85s |  We did it with an app.
1700.85s - 1704.37s |  An Amazon scam that tricks people into paying 29%
1704.37s - 1706.65s |  more than the best match for their search,
1706.65s - 1708.33s |  they did it with an app.
1708.33s - 1709.65s |  Once we kill competition,
1709.65s - 1711.93s |  once we stop putting down rat poison,
1711.93s - 1713.29s |  we got cartels.
1713.29s - 1715.33s |  The rats came and ate our faces.
1716.09s - 1717.69s |  And the cartels captured their regulators.
1717.69s - 1720.17s |  The rats bought out the poison factory
1720.17s - 1721.69s |  and they shut it down.
1721.69s - 1723.25s |  So companies are not constrained
1723.25s - 1725.45s |  by competition or regulation.
1725.45s - 1726.37s |  But you know what?
1726.37s - 1727.39s |  This is tech.
1727.39s - 1729.17s |  And tech is different.
1729.17s - 1731.41s |  It is different because it's flexible.
1731.41s - 1734.13s |  Because our computers are these marvelous things
1734.13s - 1737.61s |  called Turing-complete universal von Neumann machines.
1737.61s - 1741.05s |  And that means that any insidificatory alteration
1741.05s - 1744.85s |  to a program can be disinsidified with another program.
1744.85s - 1747.33s |  Every time HP jacks up the price of ink,
1747.33s - 1749.73s |  they invite a competitor to make a refill kit
1749.73s - 1751.45s |  or a compatible cartridge.
1751.45s - 1753.65s |  When Tesla installs code
1753.65s - 1756.53s |  that only lets you use half the charge in your battery,
1756.53s - 1758.67s |  they invite a modder to start selling kits
1758.67s - 1760.05s |  to jailbreak your Tesla
1760.05s - 1762.41s |  so you can charge your whole battery.
1762.41s - 1765.11s |  Let me take you through a little example of how this works.
1765.11s - 1767.13s |  Imagine that instead of being here at DEF CON,
1767.13s - 1770.25s |  we're at a product design meeting for our company's website.
1770.25s - 1771.73s |  And the guy leading the meeting puts his hand up
1771.73s - 1773.57s |  and he says, all right, folks, here it is.
1773.57s - 1776.13s |  Our KPI is top-line ad revenue.
1776.13s - 1778.01s |  I figured out if we make the ads
1778.01s - 1780.41s |  20% more invasive and obnoxious,
1780.41s - 1782.57s |  we're going to get 2% more ad revenue.
1782.57s - 1783.89s |  We're all going to get a ski holiday
1783.89s - 1785.49s |  in Switzerland this year.
1785.49s - 1787.73s |  And one guy sticks his hand up and he says,
1787.73s - 1789.69s |  I love how you think, Elon,
1789.69s - 1794.92s |  but has it occurred to you
1794.92s - 1797.88s |  that if we make the ads 20% more obnoxious,
1797.88s - 1800.76s |  then 40% of our users will go to a search engine
1800.76s - 1802.68s |  and type, how do I stop seeing ads?
1802.68s - 1804.40s |  I mean, what a nightmare.
1804.40s - 1806.56s |  Because once a user does that,
1806.56s - 1808.42s |  the revenue from that user doesn't rise
1808.42s - 1810.40s |  to the projected 102%.
1810.40s - 1812.24s |  It doesn't stay static at 100%.
1812.24s - 1813.12s |  It goes to zero.
1813.12s - 1815.20s |  It stays there forever.
1815.20s - 1817.12s |  Any guesses why it never comes back?
1818.56s - 1820.48s |  No one ever went back to the search engine
1820.48s - 1822.68s |  and typed, how do I start seeing ads again?
1824.28s - 1826.72s |  Once the user jailbreaks their phone
1826.72s - 1828.54s |  or discovers third-party ink
1828.54s - 1829.72s |  or develops a relationship
1829.72s - 1831.64s |  with an independent Tesla mechanic
1831.64s - 1834.14s |  who'll unlock all the DLC in their car,
1834.88s - 1836.90s |  that user is gone forever.
1836.90s - 1841.02s |  Interoperability, that latent property bequeathed to us,
1841.02s - 1843.70s |  courtesy of Harris, Turing, and von Neumann,
1843.70s - 1846.74s |  and their infinitely flexible universal machines
1846.74s - 1850.50s |  is a very serious check on and shitification.
1850.50s - 1852.26s |  The fact that Congress hasn't passed
1852.26s - 1854.30s |  a privacy law since 1988,
1854.30s - 1855.98s |  in part, you can counter that
1857.66s - 1859.90s |  with the fact that the majority of web users
1859.90s - 1861.58s |  are now running ad blockers,
1861.58s - 1863.94s |  which are also privacy blockers.
1864.70s - 1867.26s |  But no one's ever installed a tracker blocker for an app
1867.26s - 1869.22s |  because reverse engineering an app
1869.22s - 1872.34s |  puts you in jeopardy of criminal and civil prosecution
1872.34s - 1875.54s |  under section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
1875.54s - 1877.90s |  with penalties of a five-year prison sentence
1877.90s - 1881.46s |  and a $500,000 fine for a first offense.
1881.46s - 1883.50s |  And violating those terms of service
1883.50s - 1886.72s |  puts you in jeopardy under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,
1886.72s - 1890.50s |  a 1986 law that Ronald Reagan was stampeded into passing
1890.50s - 1893.08s |  after watching war games and freaking out.
1893.08s - 1894.02s |  Seriously.
1895.00s - 1897.20s |  Helping others violate the terms of service
1897.20s - 1900.40s |  by giving them a mod, that makes you a tortfeasor
1900.40s - 1903.48s |  engaged in tortious interference with contract.
1903.48s - 1905.88s |  And then there's trademark, copyright, patent,
1905.88s - 1908.20s |  all the nonsense we call IP,
1908.20s - 1910.12s |  but which Jay Freeman from the City of Project
1910.12s - 1913.36s |  calls felony contempt of business model.
1913.36s - 1915.44s |  So we're back at that product planning meeting,
1915.44s - 1917.00s |  and now it's time to talk about our app.
1917.00s - 1918.32s |  And the guy leading the meeting, he says,
1918.32s - 1920.52s |  all right, we're gonna make the ads in the app
1920.52s - 1921.80s |  20% more obnoxious.
1921.80s - 1923.24s |  And everyone turns to the loud mouth
1923.24s - 1925.40s |  who shot it down last time, and he says,
1925.40s - 1928.70s |  no, no, that's fine, but look, why are we stopping at 20%?
1928.70s - 1931.52s |  Why don't we make the ads 100% more obnoxious
1931.52s - 1933.24s |  and get 10% more revenue?
1933.24s - 1935.24s |  Because we don't care if the user goes and types,
1935.24s - 1937.82s |  how do I stop seeing ads into a search engine?
1937.82s - 1939.76s |  Because you can't.
1939.76s - 1942.64s |  So YOLO, just in shitify away.
1942.64s - 1946.04s |  IP is a euphemism for any law that lets an executive
1946.04s - 1948.16s |  reach outside of the walls of their business
1948.16s - 1951.16s |  and exert control over customers, critics, and competitors.
1951.52s - 1953.48s |  And an app is just a webpage skinned
1953.48s - 1955.84s |  with the right kind of IP to make it a felony
1955.84s - 1957.20s |  to put an ad blocker in it.
1960.20s - 1963.36s |  Thank you.
1963.36s - 1966.28s |  Interop used to stop companies from shitifying.
1966.28s - 1968.54s |  If companies made their clients suck,
1968.54s - 1970.64s |  someone rolled out an alternative client.
1970.64s - 1972.96s |  If they ripped out a feature and wanted to sell it
1972.96s - 1974.96s |  back to us as a monthly subscription,
1974.96s - 1976.96s |  someone would make a compatible plugin
1976.96s - 1980.00s |  that worked for a one-time fee or, you know, for free.
1980.00s - 1983.58s |  To help people flee MySpace, Facebook gave them a bot.
1983.58s - 1986.18s |  You gave that bot your login and password for MySpace.
1986.18s - 1988.06s |  It would log in as you several times a day,
1988.06s - 1989.26s |  scrape your waiting messages,
1989.26s - 1990.70s |  put them in your Facebook inbox,
1990.70s - 1993.58s |  and autopilot them back out onto Facebook.
1993.58s - 1995.66s |  So you didn't have to choose between the people you loved
1995.66s - 1997.82s |  who were on MySpace and Facebook,
1997.82s - 2000.42s |  which had promised that it would never spy on you.
2000.42s - 2002.10s |  Do you remember that?
2002.10s - 2004.34s |  Now, thanks to the metastasis of IP,
2004.34s - 2006.78s |  all of that is off the table today.
2006.78s - 2010.22s |  Apple owes its very existence to the iWork suite,
2010.22s - 2013.36s |  pages, numbers, keynote, which are file compatible
2014.14s - 2017.36s |  with Microsoft Office, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
2017.36s - 2020.46s |  But make an iOS runtime that plays back the files
2020.46s - 2022.80s |  you bought from Apple stores on other platforms,
2022.80s - 2024.92s |  and they will nuke you till you glow.
2026.04s - 2027.60s |  Facebook wouldn't have had a hope
2027.60s - 2029.64s |  of breaking MySpace's grip on social media
2029.64s - 2032.32s |  without that scraper, but scrape Facebook today
2032.32s - 2034.00s |  in support of an alternative client,
2034.00s - 2037.32s |  and their lawyers will bomb you until the rubble bounces.
2037.32s - 2039.16s |  Google scraped every website in the world
2039.16s - 2040.56s |  to create a search index.
2040.56s - 2042.00s |  Try and scrape Google,
2042.00s - 2044.36s |  and your head will be on a pike.
2044.36s - 2046.10s |  When they did it, that was progress.
2046.10s - 2048.32s |  When you do it, that is piracy.
2048.32s - 2050.96s |  Every pirate wants to be an admiral.
2050.96s - 2052.84s |  And because this handful of companies
2052.84s - 2055.16s |  has so thoroughly captured their regulator,
2055.16s - 2058.24s |  they can wield the power of the state against you
2058.24s - 2060.44s |  when you try to break their grip on power,
2060.44s - 2063.52s |  even as their own flagrant violations of our rights
2063.52s - 2067.00s |  go unpunished because they do them with an app.
2067.00s - 2069.24s |  Tech lost its fear of competition.
2069.24s - 2071.68s |  It neutralized the threat from its regulators,
2072.36s - 2073.84s |  and then it put those regulators in harness
2073.84s - 2076.52s |  to attack new startups who might do unto them
2076.52s - 2079.96s |  as they did unto everyone who dominated before them.
2079.96s - 2082.34s |  But even then, there was one force
2082.34s - 2085.80s |  that still kept our bosses in check, and that was us.
2085.80s - 2087.40s |  That was tech workers.
2087.40s - 2090.88s |  Tech workers have historically been in very short supply,
2090.88s - 2094.68s |  and that gave us power, and our bosses knew it.
2094.68s - 2098.16s |  To get us to work crazy hours, they came up with a trick.
2098.16s - 2100.52s |  They appealed to our love of technology.
2100.52s - 2103.72s |  They told us we were heroes of the digital transformation,
2103.72s - 2106.20s |  that we would organize the world's information
2106.20s - 2107.56s |  and make it useful,
2107.56s - 2111.00s |  that we would bring the world closer together.
2111.00s - 2113.08s |  They brought in expert set dressers
2113.08s - 2116.08s |  to turn our workplaces into whimsical campuses
2116.08s - 2118.96s |  with free laundry, gourmet cafeterias,
2118.96s - 2121.96s |  massages, kombucha, and a surgeon on hand
2121.96s - 2123.28s |  who would freeze your eggs
2123.28s - 2125.96s |  so you could work through your fertile years.
2125.96s - 2128.96s |  They convinced us that we were being pampered
2128.96s - 2130.08s |  rather than being tricked
2130.08s - 2132.08s |  into working like government mules.
2132.08s - 2133.60s |  Now, that trick, it has a name.
2133.60s - 2137.96s |  Vovazi Ettar, the librarian, she calls it vocational awe,
2137.96s - 2141.44s |  but Elon Musk just calls it being extremely hardcore.
2141.44s - 2144.20s |  And it worked well.
2144.20s - 2146.64s |  We did put in some long-ass hours,
2146.64s - 2149.48s |  but for our bosses, this trick failed badly.
2149.48s - 2151.48s |  Because if you miss your mother's funeral
2151.48s - 2153.24s |  in order to hit some deadline,
2153.24s - 2154.56s |  and then your boss orders you
2154.56s - 2157.28s |  to insidify the product you missed the funeral for,
2157.28s - 2161.08s |  you are going to experience a profound moral injury,
2161.08s - 2165.20s |  which you are absolutely gonna make your boss very aware of.
2165.20s - 2167.40s |  Because what are they gonna do, fire you?
2167.40s - 2169.32s |  They can't hire someone else to do your job,
2169.32s - 2172.64s |  and the guy across the street will pay you just as much.
2172.64s - 2174.92s |  So workers, we held the line
2174.92s - 2179.04s |  when competition, regulation, and interoperability failed.
2179.04s - 2181.28s |  But supply caught up with demand.
2181.28s - 2184.52s |  Last year, they fired 260,000 tech sector workers.
2184.52s - 2187.80s |  First six months of this year was another 100,000.
2187.80s - 2189.96s |  You can't tell your bosses to go fuck themselves
2189.96s - 2191.52s |  because they'll fire your ass
2191.52s - 2193.04s |  and give your job to someone else
2193.04s - 2194.96s |  who'll be happy to insidify the product
2194.96s - 2196.96s |  you sweated blood to ship.
2196.96s - 2200.00s |  That's why all this is happening right now.
2200.00s - 2202.20s |  Our bosses are not different.
2202.20s - 2204.32s |  They did not catch a mind virus
2204.32s - 2206.00s |  that turned them into greedy assholes
2206.00s - 2208.04s |  who don't care about our users' wellbeing
2208.04s - 2210.00s |  or the quality of our products.
2210.00s - 2212.12s |  As far as our bosses are concerned,
2213.08s - 2216.20s |  the point of that business was to charge the most,
2216.20s - 2218.68s |  deliver the least, and share as little as possible
2218.68s - 2221.40s |  with suppliers, workers, and customers
2221.40s - 2224.96s |  in order to retain money for shareholders and executives.
2224.96s - 2226.88s |  They are not running charities.
2226.88s - 2229.48s |  Since day one, our bosses have reported
2229.48s - 2230.64s |  for work every morning,
2230.64s - 2232.32s |  grabbed the giant lever behind their desk
2232.32s - 2233.72s |  labeled in shitification,
2233.72s - 2235.88s |  and pulled on it as hard as they could.
2235.88s - 2237.72s |  But the lever didn't move much.
2237.72s - 2239.44s |  It was gummed up by competition,
2239.44s - 2241.68s |  by regulation, by interoperability,
2241.68s - 2243.44s |  by the tech workforce.
2243.44s - 2246.20s |  And as those sources of friction melted away,
2246.20s - 2249.52s |  that insidification lever started moving pretty freely.
2249.52s - 2252.36s |  Now that sucks, I know, but think about this for a sec.
2252.36s - 2255.88s |  Our bosses, despite being wildly imperfect vessels,
2255.88s - 2258.92s |  capable of rationalizing endless greed and cheating,
2258.92s - 2262.52s |  nevertheless, made a series of actually great products
2262.52s - 2266.04s |  and services, not because they were better people then,
2266.04s - 2268.80s |  but because they were subject to discipline.
2268.80s - 2271.76s |  So it follows that if we want to end the inshitticene,
2271.76s - 2273.92s |  if we want to dismantle the inshitternet,
2273.92s - 2276.12s |  if we want to build a new good internet
2276.12s - 2278.04s |  that our bosses can't wreck,
2278.04s - 2279.88s |  we need to make sure that those constraints
2279.88s - 2282.56s |  are durably installed on our new internet,
2282.56s - 2284.96s |  wound around its roots and nerves.
2284.96s - 2287.44s |  And we have to stand guard over those forces
2287.44s - 2290.12s |  so that they can't be dismantled again.
2290.12s - 2292.88s |  A new good internet is one that has the positive aspects
2292.88s - 2294.36s |  of the old good internet,
2294.36s - 2297.04s |  the ethic of technological self-determination,
2297.04s - 2299.92s |  where users of technology and the hackers,
2299.92s - 2301.28s |  the tinkerers, the startups,
2301.28s - 2303.40s |  and the others who serve as their proxies
2303.40s - 2306.20s |  can reconfigure the technology to make it work
2306.20s - 2307.68s |  so that it does what they need it to do
2307.68s - 2309.68s |  and cannot be used against them.
2309.68s - 2312.56s |  But the new good internet has to fix the defect
2312.56s - 2314.12s |  of the old good internet,
2314.12s - 2316.36s |  the part that made it hard for anyone who wasn't us
2316.36s - 2317.84s |  to figure out how to use it.
2317.84s - 2319.72s |  And hell yeah, we can do that.
2319.72s - 2322.08s |  Tech bosses swear that this is impossible.
2322.08s - 2323.76s |  You can't have a conversation with a friend
2323.76s - 2325.52s |  without Zuck being present.
2325.52s - 2326.52s |  You can't search the web
2326.52s - 2329.08s |  without letting Google scrape you down to your viscera.
2329.08s - 2331.76s |  You can't have a phone that works reliably
2331.76s - 2334.08s |  without Apple getting a veto over your software.
2334.08s - 2335.28s |  They claim that it's nonsense
2335.28s - 2337.70s |  to even ponder this proposition.
2337.70s - 2341.00s |  It's like making water that's not wet, but that is bullshit.
2341.00s - 2342.96s |  We can have nice things.
2342.96s - 2345.32s |  We can build for the people we love
2345.32s - 2348.60s |  and give them a place worthy of their time and attention.
2348.60s - 2351.52s |  To do that, we have to install constraints.
2351.52s - 2354.02s |  The first constraint, remember, it's competition.
2354.02s - 2356.38s |  We are living through an epochal shift
2356.38s - 2358.06s |  in competition policy.
2358.06s - 2362.46s |  After 40 years of antitrust enforcement in an induced coma,
2362.46s - 2364.26s |  a wave of antitrust vigor
2364.26s - 2366.82s |  has swept through governments all over the world.
2366.82s - 2370.06s |  Regulators are stepping up to ban monopolistic practices,
2370.06s - 2371.70s |  to open up walled gardens,
2371.70s - 2373.78s |  to block anti-competitive mergers,
2373.78s - 2375.82s |  and even unwind the corrupt mergers
2375.82s - 2378.30s |  that were undertaken on false pretenses.
2378.30s - 2380.74s |  Now, normally this is the part in this speech
2380.74s - 2382.32s |  where I'd listed all the amazing things
2382.32s - 2384.36s |  that have happened over the past four years,
2384.36s - 2386.46s |  the enforcement actions that block companies
2386.46s - 2388.04s |  from becoming too big to care,
2388.04s - 2390.76s |  and that scared companies away from even trying,
2390.76s - 2392.72s |  like Wiz, which just noped out
2392.72s - 2396.36s |  of the largest acquisition offer in world history,
2396.36s - 2399.20s |  turning down Google's $23 billion buyout
2399.20s - 2402.28s |  and deciding to, you know, just be a fucking business
2402.28s - 2405.06s |  that makes money by making a product that people want
2405.06s - 2407.38s |  that is sold at a competitive price.
2407.38s - 2410.40s |  Normally, I'd be listing out FTC rule-makings here,
2411.24s - 2413.40s |  that banned non-competes worldwide,
2413.40s - 2414.92s |  or the new merger guidelines
2414.92s - 2417.08s |  that the FTC and the DOJ cooked up,
2417.08s - 2419.64s |  which, among other things, make privacy something
2419.64s - 2421.92s |  that has to be considered in mergers.
2421.92s - 2424.16s |  I had a whole section of this stuff in my notes,
2424.16s - 2427.06s |  an absolute victory lap, but I deleted it this week.
2427.06s - 2429.64s |  Does anyone know why I deleted it this week?
2429.64s - 2430.70s |  Anyone wanna guess?
2431.84s - 2435.04s |  All right, this week, Judge Amit Mehta,
2435.04s - 2438.66s |  ruling for the DC Circuit of these United States of America
2438.66s - 2441.82s |  in the docket 20-3010,
2441.82s - 2445.90s |  in a case known as United States versus Google LLC,
2445.90s - 2448.34s |  found that Google is a monopolist
2448.34s - 2452.66s |  and it has acted as a monopolist to maintain its monopoly,
2452.66s - 2455.70s |  and ordered that Google and the DOJ propose a schedule
2455.70s - 2464.28s |  for a remedy like breaking the company up.
2464.28s - 2466.64s |  So yeah, that was pretty fucking epic.
2466.64s - 2468.48s |  Now, this antitrust stuff is esoteric,
2468.48s - 2469.52s |  and I'm not gonna shame you
2469.52s - 2471.76s |  if you wanna keep a little distance on the subject.
2471.76s - 2475.12s |  Nearly everyone is an antitrust normie, and that's fine.
2475.12s - 2476.16s |  But if you're a normie,
2476.16s - 2478.08s |  you're probably only catching little bits and pieces
2478.08s - 2479.00s |  of this narrative.
2479.00s - 2480.60s |  And let me tell you, the monopolists know that,
2480.60s - 2482.60s |  and they are flooding the zone with shit.
2482.60s - 2486.68s |  The Wall Street Journal has published 100 editorials
2486.68s - 2487.84s |  condemning Lena Kahn,
2487.84s - 2489.48s |  the chair of the Federal Trade Commission,
2489.48s - 2492.72s |  for doing nothing and getting nothing done with public funds.
2492.72s - 2495.48s |  Anyone out there know who owns the Wall Street Journal?
2496.48s - 2497.56s |  No?
2497.56s - 2499.12s |  Rupert Murdoch.
2499.12s - 2499.96s |  Rupert Murdoch.
2499.96s - 2502.88s |  Do you really think Rupert Murdoch pays his editorial board
2502.88s - 2505.40s |  to write 100 op-eds about someone
2505.40s - 2508.00s |  who's not getting anything done?
2508.00s - 2510.64s |  The reality is that in the United States, in the UK,
2510.64s - 2513.52s |  in the EU, in Australia, in Canada, in China,
2513.52s - 2515.24s |  in Japan, in South Korea,
2515.24s - 2518.40s |  we are seeing more antitrust action over the past four years
2518.40s - 2520.32s |  than over the preceding 40.
2520.32s - 2523.44s |  And remember, the competition law is pretty robust.
2523.44s - 2526.12s |  The problem's not the law, it's the enforcement priorities.
2526.12s - 2528.76s |  Reagan put him in mothballs 40 years ago.
2528.76s - 2531.68s |  But that is an elegant weapon from a more civilized age,
2531.68s - 2534.08s |  and it has found its way into the hands of people
2534.08s - 2535.80s |  who sure know how to use it.
2535.80s - 2538.04s |  And they are swinging for the fences.
2538.04s - 2539.96s |  So next up is regulation.
2539.96s - 2542.80s |  As the seemingly inescapable power of the tech giants
2542.80s - 2545.72s |  is revealed as the sham that we always suspected it was,
2545.72s - 2547.64s |  governments and regulators are finally gonna kill
2547.64s - 2549.96s |  the one weird trick of violating the law,
2549.96s - 2552.20s |  but saying it's okay because we did it with an app.
2552.20s - 2554.68s |  In the EU, they've got the new digital markets app
2554.68s - 2557.24s |  that requires dominant platforms to open up APIs
2557.24s - 2559.56s |  so that you can move easily between services.
2559.56s - 2561.20s |  And that's a very cool rule,
2561.20s - 2564.28s |  but what's even cooler is how it's gonna be enforced.
2564.28s - 2567.00s |  Previous EU rules, they were called regulations,
2567.00s - 2568.56s |  which meant that they had to be turned into law
2568.56s - 2570.80s |  in each EU member state.
2570.80s - 2574.52s |  And for big tech, that meant that all enforcement of laws
2574.52s - 2577.44s |  like the General Data Privacy Protection Regulation
2577.44s - 2578.60s |  started in Ireland,
2578.60s - 2580.48s |  where they all pretend to be headquartered.
2580.48s - 2582.48s |  And they pretend to be headquartered in Ireland
2582.48s - 2584.40s |  because Ireland is a tax haven,
2584.40s - 2586.40s |  and so they fly Irish flags of convenience.
2586.40s - 2588.28s |  But here's the thing,
2588.28s - 2590.64s |  every tax haven has to be a crime haven
2590.64s - 2592.84s |  because any company that is footloose enough
2592.84s - 2594.56s |  to pretend to be Irish this week
2594.56s - 2598.40s |  could pretend to be Maltese or Luxembourgian
2598.40s - 2600.48s |  or Cypriot next week.
2600.48s - 2604.16s |  So to keep those footloose criminal enterprises happy,
2604.16s - 2606.80s |  they have to stop enforcing their laws.
2606.80s - 2609.80s |  That's why the GDPR is such a goddamn joke in practice
2609.80s - 2612.68s |  because the only way to get these companies held to account
2612.68s - 2616.04s |  for their GDPR policies is to go after them in Ireland
2616.72s - 2619.00s |  where the Irish data commissioner barely gets out of bed.
2619.00s - 2621.52s |  And when they do, they usually spend most of the day
2621.52s - 2623.16s |  in their pajamas eating breakfast cereal
2623.16s - 2624.52s |  in front of the television.
2625.56s - 2627.12s |  Now, all of this is hardly a secret.
2627.12s - 2629.64s |  The European Commission knows that it's going on.
2629.64s - 2631.68s |  So with the DMA, the commission starts
2631.68s - 2635.08s |  all of the enforcement in the federal courts,
2635.08s - 2638.24s |  which have no way in which they are beholden
2638.24s - 2640.68s |  to these big tech companies.
2640.68s - 2645.00s |  In other words, we violate privacy, excuse me,
2645.00s - 2647.76s |  we violate privacy law that work,
2647.76s - 2649.56s |  but it's okay because we did it with an app
2649.56s - 2650.72s |  that worked for so many years.
2650.72s - 2652.44s |  It's now a dead letter.
2652.44s - 2655.56s |  And here in the US, the dam is finally breaking
2655.56s - 2658.04s |  on getting a federal privacy law for us.
2658.04s - 2659.48s |  It's been a minute.
2659.48s - 2661.04s |  And the thing is there are a lot of people
2661.04s - 2664.96s |  who are very angry about how poor privacy law is in America,
2664.96s - 2666.40s |  not because they're worried about privacy,
2666.40s - 2668.24s |  but because they're worried about other stuff.
2668.24s - 2670.32s |  Maybe Grampy was on Facebook
2670.32s - 2672.28s |  and you think that's how it became a QAnon,
2672.28s - 2675.28s |  or you think maybe Insta made your teen anorexic,
2675.28s - 2677.56s |  or you're worried that cops rolled up all the demonstrators
2677.56s - 2679.48s |  at that Black Lives Matter demonstration
2679.48s - 2681.04s |  using Google location data,
2681.04s - 2682.00s |  or you're worried that they did it
2682.00s - 2683.72s |  to the January 6th rioters,
2683.72s - 2685.64s |  or that you're worried that red state attorneys general
2685.64s - 2689.24s |  follow teenagers across state lines into abortion clinics,
2689.24s - 2690.44s |  or you're worried that black people
2690.44s - 2691.56s |  are being discriminated against
2691.56s - 2693.48s |  in lending and job applications,
2693.48s - 2696.84s |  or that someone made AI deepfake porn of you.
2696.84s - 2699.44s |  A federal privacy law with a private right of action
2699.44s - 2701.92s |  would do something about all of those problems.
2701.92s - 2704.72s |  That makes a very big coalition for privacy law,
2704.72s - 2707.76s |  which is why we're seeing a procession of imperfect,
2707.76s - 2710.04s |  but steadily improving privacy laws
2710.04s - 2711.80s |  working their way through Congress.
2711.80s - 2714.20s |  So I work for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
2714.20s - 2716.88s |  If you sign up for our list at EFF.org,
2716.88s - 2719.12s |  we're gonna send you emails when those laws come up,
2719.12s - 2721.60s |  and you can call up your Congress jerk or your senator,
2721.60s - 2723.12s |  and you can talk to them about it.
2723.12s - 2725.28s |  You can make an appointment to drop by their offices
2725.28s - 2726.52s |  when they're in their home district
2726.52s - 2728.96s |  and explain to them that you're not just a registered voter
2728.96s - 2730.00s |  from their districts,
2730.00s - 2731.24s |  that you're the kind of tech person
2731.56s - 2732.52s |  who goes to DEF CON,
2732.52s - 2734.32s |  and then you can explain the bill to them.
2734.32s - 2736.40s |  And that stuff makes a difference.
2736.40s - 2738.16s |  So how about self-help?
2738.16s - 2741.56s |  How are we doing on making interoperability legal again?
2741.56s - 2742.40s |  I'm nearly done.
2743.32s - 2744.92s |  Two minutes, sorry.
2744.92s - 2746.72s |  My mic stopped working for a minute.
2746.72s - 2751.87s |  How are we doing on making,
2751.87s - 2753.03s |  I'm seriously almost done.
2753.03s - 2755.15s |  Stop clapping so I can finish.
2755.15s - 2757.51s |  How are we doing on making interoperability legal again?
2757.51s - 2760.27s |  Well, we got these state right-to-repair bills
2760.27s - 2761.75s |  that ban parts pairing,
2761.79s - 2763.71s |  that ban using DRM for parts.
2764.55s - 2767.03s |  These bills are pushed by a fantastic group
2767.03s - 2770.71s |  of organizations called the Repair Coalition at repair.org,
2770.71s - 2772.51s |  and they'll email you when one of these bills
2772.51s - 2773.87s |  are going through your state house,
2773.87s - 2775.39s |  and you can meet with your state reps
2775.39s - 2776.75s |  and explain to the JV squad
2776.75s - 2778.75s |  what you just explained to your federal reps.
2778.75s - 2781.75s |  And the prime mover behind repair.org is iFixit,
2781.75s - 2785.11s |  and iFixit's founder, Kyle Wiens, is here at DEF CON.
2785.11s - 2786.79s |  So when you see him, shake his hand,
2786.79s - 2787.63s |  thank him for his service,
2787.63s - 2790.67s |  but tell him you've signed up for the mailing list as well.
2790.67s - 2792.67s |  Now onto that last workforce,
2792.67s - 2794.27s |  and my last page, I promise.
2795.43s - 2798.55s |  The thing that used to stop tech bosses from going bad,
2798.55s - 2800.43s |  and that's you, the tech workforce.
2800.43s - 2801.95s |  For years, your bosses tricked you
2801.95s - 2803.95s |  into thinking you were founders and waiting,
2803.95s - 2805.71s |  temporarily embarrassed entrepreneurs,
2805.71s - 2808.67s |  momentarily drawing a salary, not workers.
2808.67s - 2810.51s |  Your power came from intrinsic virtue,
2810.51s - 2813.99s |  not like those lazy slobs in their unions.
2813.99s - 2816.23s |  Now that was a trick, and you got scammed.
2816.23s - 2818.15s |  The power you had came from scarcity,
2818.15s - 2819.59s |  so when scarcity ended,
2820.95s - 2823.59s |  when the industry started ringing in six-figure layoffs,
2823.59s - 2825.15s |  your power went away.
2825.15s - 2828.03s |  The only durable source of power for tech workers
2828.03s - 2831.19s |  is as workers in unions.
2831.19s - 2832.35s |  Think about Amazon.
2832.35s - 2836.39s |  I got to finish, stop clapping.
2837.39s - 2838.35s |  Think about Amazon.
2838.35s - 2840.59s |  Warehouse workers have to piss in bottles
2840.59s - 2843.15s |  and have the highest rate of on-the-job injuries
2843.15s - 2845.75s |  of any comparable company in the industry,
2845.75s - 2848.15s |  whereas Amazon coders get to show up for work
2848.15s - 2850.87s |  with facial piercings, green mohawks, and black t-shirts
2850.87s - 2853.07s |  that say things their bosses don't understand.
2853.07s - 2855.35s |  They can piss whenever they want to.
2855.35s - 2858.31s |  That's not because Jeff Bezos loves tech workers.
2858.31s - 2860.19s |  It's because they're scared you'll quit,
2860.19s - 2862.19s |  and they won't be able to replace you.
2862.19s - 2863.19s |  Another William Gibson quote,
2863.19s - 2865.83s |  the future is here, it's just not evenly distributed.
2865.83s - 2867.07s |  You know who lives in the future?
2867.07s - 2868.71s |  Amazon warehouse workers.
2868.71s - 2870.91s |  They are living in your future.
2870.91s - 2873.59s |  Drivers whose eyeballs are monitored by AI cameras
2873.59s - 2876.03s |  that do phrenology on their faces
2876.03s - 2878.27s |  to figure out when to dock their pay,
2878.27s - 2880.51s |  and warehouse workers whose bodies are ruined
2880.51s - 2882.15s |  in a matter of months.
2882.15s - 2884.63s |  As tech bosses beef up this reserve army
2884.63s - 2887.23s |  of unemployed skilled tech workers,
2887.23s - 2889.03s |  those tech workers, you folks,
2889.03s - 2891.35s |  will arrive at the same future as them.
2891.35s - 2893.19s |  Look, I know you spent your careers
2893.19s - 2895.75s |  explaining in words so small your boss could understand them
2895.75s - 2898.71s |  that you refused to insidify your company's products,
2898.71s - 2900.59s |  and I thank you for your service,
2900.59s - 2902.83s |  but if you want to go on fighting for the user,
2902.83s - 2904.63s |  you need power that's better than scarcity.
2904.63s - 2906.47s |  You need a union.
2906.47s - 2907.59s |  Want to learn how?
2907.59s - 2909.99s |  Check out the Tech Workers Coalition and Tech Solidarity
2909.99s - 2911.55s |  and get organized.
2911.55s - 2914.55s |  Insidification is not here because our bosses changed.
2914.55s - 2915.71s |  They were always that guy.
2915.71s - 2917.43s |  They were always yanking the lever.
2917.43s - 2919.19s |  What changed was the environment,
2919.19s - 2921.99s |  everything that kept the insidification switch from moving,
2921.99s - 2923.95s |  and that is good news because it means
2923.95s - 2926.71s |  that we can have good products with imperfect people.
2926.71s - 2929.27s |  A new good internet is in our grasp,
2929.27s - 2931.91s |  an internet with the technological self-determination
2931.91s - 2934.71s |  of the old good internet and the grease skid simplicity
2934.71s - 2937.67s |  of Web 2.0 that let normie friends get in on the fun.
2937.67s - 2939.31s |  Tech bosses want you to think
2939.31s - 2942.15s |  that UX and insidification can't be separated,
2942.15s - 2944.15s |  and that is self-serving bullshit.
2944.15s - 2946.59s |  We know it because we built the old good internet,
2946.59s - 2948.51s |  and we've been fighting a rearguard action
2948.51s - 2950.35s |  to preserve it over the past two decades,
2950.35s - 2953.79s |  and it's time to stop playing defense and go on the offense
2953.79s - 2956.47s |  to restore competition, to restore regulation,
2956.47s - 2958.75s |  interoperability, and tech worker power
2958.75s - 2960.95s |  so that we can create a new good internet
2960.95s - 2962.83s |  that we're gonna need to fight fascism,
2962.83s - 2965.31s |  the climate emergency, and genocide,
2965.31s - 2968.19s |  to build a digital nervous system for the 21st century
2968.19s - 2970.27s |  in which our children will thrive and prosper.
2970.27s - 2976.26s |  Thank you.
2976.26s - 2982.34s |  All right, I'm going to the signing area.
2982.34s - 2984.74s |  It's outside the hopsters' room.
2984.74s - 2985.74s |  Come and say hello.
