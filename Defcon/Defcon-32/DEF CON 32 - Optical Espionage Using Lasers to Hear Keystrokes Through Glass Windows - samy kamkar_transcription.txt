  "description": "Sashay away from this talk with the knowledge to perform state-of-the-art espionage, no technical background required.\n\nIn the realm of privilege escalation and data exfiltration, the physical world quietly screams secrets. We'll demystify the fascinating physics behind signals and how various forms of energy--infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light, radio, ultrasound, audible sound, mechanical vibration, and temperature--can be interpreted as waves that unintentionally leak information, even in air-gapped (non-networked) systems. We'll observe how air is in fact not an effective gap or barrier as radio, light, sound, and vibration excitedly travel through it. We'll explore how all electrical signals radiate electromagnetism (light or radio) that can be intercepted and how we can reverse this process, producing electromagnetism to inject desired electrical signals into our target.\n\nWe'll delve into historical and seminal side-channel/TEMPEST attacks from our friends at the NSA, KGB, and past DEF CON pioneers. You'll learn about the essential electrical and optical components combined for cutting-edge eavesdropping, including what our target is typing from a distance.\n\nWhile others believe they're obtaining noise, we will extract signal, and you'll leave this talk hearing the world in a new light.",

 How's everybody doing?
2.00s - 5.00s |  Okay, I want you to, on three, repeat after me the word engage.
5.00s - 7.00s |  Ready? One, two, three.
7.00s - 8.00s |  Engage.
8.00s - 10.00s |  Engage. One, two, three.
10.00s - 11.00s |  Engage.
11.00s - 14.89s |  Awesome. Here's our speaker, give him a big hand.
14.89s - 20.11s |  Thank you.
20.11s - 24.11s |  It's 1995, I'm ten years old,
24.11s - 28.11s |  and my mom just spent everything she had to get me this computer.
28.11s - 30.11s |  And this is the best day of my life.
30.11s - 33.11s |  I dial up to the internet. Some of you know what that means.
33.11s - 35.11s |  I dial up to my mom's university
35.11s - 38.11s |  and I download MIRC.
38.11s - 41.11s |  I go on to Internet Relay Chat IRC.
41.11s - 42.11s |  Oh no.
42.11s - 45.11s |  And I join a channel and I say,
45.11s - 49.11s |  who wants to chat about the X-Files?
49.11s - 53.11s |  And someone says, get out.
53.11s - 55.11s |  And I didn't understand why.
55.11s - 57.11s |  And I said, we can chat about something else.
57.11s - 59.11s |  What TV show do you like?
59.11s - 63.11s |  And they say, you have ten seconds to get out of this chat room.
63.11s - 66.11s |  And I think, my mom told me, don't tell anyone your name on the internet
66.11s - 68.11s |  and don't tell them where you live.
68.11s - 70.11s |  So they don't know anything about me.
70.11s - 72.11s |  So I say, no.
72.11s - 76.11s |  And this person says, you have ten seconds to get out of this chat room.
76.11s - 77.11s |  I'm like, no.
77.11s - 81.11s |  Ten seconds later, the brand new computer that my mom spent everything on
81.11s - 83.11s |  does this.
83.11s - 85.11s |  It wasn't running CrowdStrike.
85.11s - 88.11s |  This is 1995.
88.11s - 91.11s |  This person just crashed my computer over the internet
91.11s - 93.11s |  without knowing anything about me.
93.11s - 94.11s |  And I freaked out.
94.11s - 96.11s |  I'm going to be grounded for the rest of my life.
96.11s - 99.11s |  I pull all the wires out of the computer.
99.11s - 102.11s |  I wait for the computer to heal.
102.11s - 104.11s |  About half an hour.
104.11s - 106.11s |  I plug the wires back in.
106.11s - 108.11s |  And it comes up.
108.11s - 112.11s |  As it's coming up, everything is okay.
112.11s - 115.11s |  And while the adrenaline is still rushing through my veins,
115.11s - 117.11s |  I think, that is the coolest thing ever.
117.11s - 119.11s |  How do I do that?
119.11s - 122.11s |  And I find this, Winuke95.
122.11s - 126.11s |  So a single out-of-band packet will crash Windows 95.
126.11s - 127.11s |  And this was super cool.
127.11s - 131.11s |  I downloaded this program, and now I'm an elite hacksaw.
131.11s - 134.11s |  And then Microsoft released Windows Service Pack 2,
134.11s - 136.11s |  which resolved this.
136.11s - 138.11s |  And all of a sudden, my magical tool didn't work anymore.
138.11s - 143.11s |  So how do I learn how to create Winuke96?
143.11s - 145.11s |  And that's when I found Frack.
145.11s - 147.11s |  And Frack is a magazine that's still going today.
147.11s - 149.11s |  I believe it started in 85.
149.11s - 152.11s |  And I read, smashing the stack for fun and profit.
152.11s - 155.11s |  And this just blew my mind.
155.11s - 158.11s |  The simplest C program that says, hey, what is your name?
158.11s - 160.11s |  You have to allocate 100 bytes, and you say,
160.11s - 161.11s |  and you type in your name.
161.11s - 163.11s |  And if it doesn't check, and it just prints,
163.11s - 165.11s |  hey, hello, your name,
165.11s - 166.11s |  if you type over that 100 bytes,
166.11s - 168.11s |  and you're not checking for 100 bytes,
168.11s - 169.11s |  you can start overwriting memory,
169.11s - 170.11s |  and then you can overwrite the stack pointer,
170.11s - 172.11s |  and then you can point back to the beginning of your name,
172.11s - 173.11s |  and that can be shell code,
173.11s - 174.11s |  and that can execute code on the computer,
174.11s - 175.11s |  and you can take over a computer
175.11s - 177.11s |  with an extremely simple program.
177.11s - 180.11s |  And that taught me that the way a system works
180.11s - 182.11s |  is not how we think it works.
182.11s - 185.11s |  Like, I want to now understand, what is the ground truth?
185.11s - 186.11s |  How do systems actually work?
186.11s - 188.11s |  How does a computer actually work?
188.11s - 189.11s |  And it's only when you understand
189.11s - 190.11s |  the CPU architecture and memory,
190.11s - 194.11s |  and how, when you're compiling your C code into,
194.11s - 195.11s |  and assembling it, and linking it,
195.11s - 197.11s |  how you can actually take over the system.
197.11s - 200.11s |  And over time, as I've learned from many of you,
200.11s - 202.11s |  and from papers, and from videos,
202.11s - 203.11s |  and just testing things,
203.11s - 206.11s |  that ultimately, everything boils down to energy.
206.11s - 208.11s |  Like, everything is energy.
208.11s - 209.11s |  Information is energy.
209.11s - 213.11s |  By energy, I'm really talking, we're talking power.
213.11s - 215.11s |  Energy is the capacity to do work.
215.11s - 217.11s |  So, to perform some type of work.
217.11s - 220.11s |  Power is the rate at which that work is done.
220.11s - 222.11s |  So, for example, a horsepower.
222.11s - 225.11s |  Like, a horsepower is actually a unit of power.
225.11s - 230.11s |  One horsepower lifts 550 pounds in one second, by one foot.
230.11s - 231.11s |  I looked it up on Wikipedia.
231.11s - 233.11s |  It's actually imperial horsepower.
233.11s - 235.11s |  That means there's also a metric horsepower,
235.11s - 238.11s |  which lifts 542 pounds, slightly less.
238.11s - 241.11s |  I'm not sure what we're feeding our horses.
241.11s - 246.11s |  Probably HGH, horse growth hormone.
246.11s - 248.11s |  So, energy in power.
248.11s - 250.11s |  And I realize, energy is information.
250.11s - 252.11s |  So, if we want to actually move any information around,
252.11s - 254.11s |  we must use energy.
254.11s - 255.11s |  An example of that is,
255.11s - 257.11s |  we think that there's power in data,
257.11s - 258.11s |  but that's not true.
258.11s - 259.11s |  That's not true.
259.11s - 261.11s |  Power is data, and data is power.
261.11s - 263.11s |  If you have a USB 2.0,
263.11s - 265.11s |  you plug your USB in, it doesn't work,
265.11s - 267.11s |  so you plug it in the other way, it doesn't work.
267.11s - 268.11s |  The third time, it always works.
268.11s - 270.11s |  When you plug that in, there are four pins.
270.11s - 272.11s |  There's ground, power, and then two data.
272.11s - 273.11s |  Differential data.
273.11s - 276.11s |  Now, the ground and power, there's energy moving over that.
276.11s - 278.11s |  But there's also information across that.
278.11s - 280.11s |  If you're plugged into a computer that's encrypting something,
280.11s - 282.11s |  there's going to be some information of that encryption
282.11s - 284.11s |  about the amount of power that's being,
284.11s - 286.11s |  and that's going to ride on the power.
286.11s - 289.11s |  The power will actually go up and down just a little bit.
289.11s - 291.11s |  That five volts will move up and down.
291.11s - 292.11s |  You can measure that.
292.11s - 293.11s |  And then there's the data.
293.11s - 294.11s |  Well, how does the data work?
294.11s - 297.11s |  Like, what is actually going across data lines?
297.11s - 298.11s |  That's a voltage.
298.11s - 300.11s |  So there is actually current and voltage,
300.11s - 303.11s |  which is power, pushing through those data lines.
303.11s - 306.11s |  So you can always extract power from this stuff.
306.11s - 309.11s |  And I remember I'm sitting at my computer maybe 15 years ago,
309.11s - 312.11s |  and I had these Dell speakers on my computer,
312.11s - 315.11s |  and I got a text message,
315.11s - 316.11s |  and I was about to get a text message,
316.11s - 318.11s |  and I don't know if many of you recall
318.11s - 320.11s |  that sometimes you get this interference.
320.11s - 321.11s |  You get a text message or a phone call,
321.11s - 322.11s |  and then your speakers go,
322.11s - 324.11s |  do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
324.11s - 327.11s |  And I was like, wait, my phone's not connected to anything,
327.11s - 330.11s |  yet the speakers are actually playing sound.
330.11s - 332.11s |  Like, there is some sort of interference here.
332.11s - 333.11s |  Could I control that?
333.11s - 335.11s |  Like, if my phone can do that,
335.11s - 337.11s |  so it's not actually the cell towers,
337.11s - 339.11s |  it's actually your phone trying to amplify its signal
339.11s - 340.11s |  and get back to the cell tower.
340.11s - 343.11s |  The cell tower is far away, so it amplifies the signal.
343.11s - 345.11s |  And I thought, okay, well, can I open a keyboard?
345.11s - 347.11s |  Can I look at how the keyboard works?
347.11s - 349.11s |  And if my phone can interfere with the speaker,
349.11s - 351.11s |  can my phone then interfere with the keyboard?
351.11s - 353.11s |  And can I press keystrokes?
353.11s - 355.11s |  So I opened up a keyboard.
355.11s - 356.11s |  It's a USB keyboard.
356.11s - 357.11s |  And when you open it up,
357.11s - 359.11s |  you have a circuit board that's PCB,
359.11s - 360.11s |  your fiberglass,
360.11s - 362.11s |  and then you have all these conductors.
362.11s - 365.11s |  And every conductor going to every key is a unique length,
365.11s - 366.11s |  and they're all copper.
366.11s - 367.11s |  They're all metal.
367.11s - 369.11s |  Any piece of metal is an antenna.
369.11s - 371.11s |  If you measure that antenna, the length of that antenna,
371.11s - 372.11s |  that's a monopole antenna.
372.11s - 374.11s |  That measurement is the wavelength,
374.11s - 375.11s |  the resonant frequency.
375.11s - 377.11s |  So you can figure out the resonant frequency
377.11s - 379.11s |  of every wire going into that.
379.11s - 382.11s |  And I thought, well, can I create an electromagnetic radio
382.11s - 386.11s |  that can then inject keystrokes into this keyboard wirelessly?
386.11s - 388.11s |  And I started to try to do this.
388.11s - 391.11s |  And I started to realize that it's not working.
391.11s - 393.11s |  I tried a couple different software-defined radios
393.11s - 396.11s |  like HackRF and the USRP-B210,
396.11s - 399.11s |  and I was never able to inject all the keystrokes I wanted.
399.11s - 401.11s |  With one keyboard, I was able to inject a few keystrokes.
401.11s - 402.11s |  And I'm like,
402.11s - 404.11s |  I really just don't understand electromagnetism enough.
404.11s - 406.11s |  So I started to learn about physics.
406.11s - 409.11s |  And I started to learn about, well, what is electromagnetism?
409.11s - 412.11s |  It's really light, light and radio.
412.11s - 415.11s |  And I took a picture of a rainbow on a jog.
415.11s - 419.11s |  And really, electromagnetism is light.
419.11s - 423.11s |  We can split that light up into its constituent wavelengths,
423.11s - 425.11s |  and there's all sorts of other frequencies.
425.11s - 427.11s |  So radio, for example, is light.
427.11s - 430.11s |  Radio is just colors of light that we can't see with our eyes.
430.11s - 433.11s |  And as I wanted to learn about this and how this stuff works,
433.11s - 436.11s |  I started learning about light and EM and radio.
436.11s - 438.11s |  And I need to learn physics.
438.11s - 440.11s |  So I started to get some physics books
440.11s - 442.11s |  and start reading about this stuff.
442.11s - 444.11s |  One of those books was Building Scientific Apparatus.
444.11s - 446.11s |  And I learned, okay, well,
446.11s - 448.11s |  a lot of the people who are learning physics,
448.11s - 451.11s |  which is really how hardware works and how radio works,
451.11s - 453.11s |  they started by, like, J.J. Thompson,
453.11s - 455.11s |  who broke the atom open.
455.11s - 458.11s |  Like, it's called the atom from Greek atomos, meaning indivisible.
458.11s - 460.11s |  Until this dude, J.J. Thompson,
460.11s - 462.11s |  put a bunch of atoms inside of a glass tube,
462.11s - 464.11s |  evacuated, pulled almost everything out,
464.11s - 466.11s |  put a high voltage, and then split the atom.
466.11s - 468.11s |  It was divisible.
468.11s - 470.11s |  And then he used magnets, and he could move the atoms
470.11s - 472.11s |  that were producing light.
472.11s - 474.11s |  And that became our cathode ray tube,
474.11s - 476.11s |  our CRT TVs and monitors that we used.
476.11s - 478.11s |  I'm like, this is super cool. I should reproduce this.
478.11s - 480.11s |  So I set up a little glassblowing station at home,
480.11s - 483.11s |  and I tried to blow glass and do some lamp work,
483.11s - 485.11s |  but all my stuff would always break.
485.11s - 487.11s |  I'd make something, and then it would crack.
487.11s - 490.11s |  I'm like, all right, I need to actually learn some glassblowing.
490.11s - 492.11s |  I took some classes in L.A.,
492.11s - 494.11s |  but these are all soft glass.
494.11s - 496.11s |  And I still would come home, and I'd try to make some stuff,
496.11s - 498.11s |  and it would break.
498.11s - 500.11s |  Then I went on the Internet, and I found, okay,
500.11s - 503.11s |  I found this guy who makes all sorts of borosilicate glass,
503.11s - 505.11s |  which is like scientific glassblowing.
505.11s - 507.11s |  And I messaged him, and I messaged everyone,
507.11s - 509.11s |  every other scientific glassblower in Los Angeles.
509.11s - 512.11s |  Hey, I want you to learn how to glassblow.
512.11s - 514.11s |  I will pay you.
514.11s - 516.11s |  Everyone said no. Like, I have a job.
516.11s - 518.11s |  I can't just come to my work.
518.11s - 520.11s |  And that's probably, like, illegal or something.
520.11s - 522.11s |  So I went on LinkedIn, and I searched
522.11s - 524.11s |  more scientific glassblowers across the U.S.,
524.11s - 526.11s |  and I just messaged everyone.
526.11s - 528.11s |  Like, someone has to say yes, right?
528.11s - 530.11s |  Someone will, like, let me pay them for a few hours,
530.11s - 532.11s |  so I can just, and I get a response from Katie.
532.11s - 534.11s |  Hey, I see that you're in L.A.
534.11s - 536.11s |  We're in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
536.11s - 538.11s |  Is this something that you would travel for?
538.11s - 540.11s |  So a week later, I get,
540.11s - 543.11s |  Delta tickets are very cheap to Wisconsin in winter.
543.11s - 546.11s |  It's because it's freezing in Wisconsin in the winter.
546.11s - 548.11s |  It's so cold.
548.11s - 550.11s |  I show up to this place, and I say,
550.11s - 552.11s |  is Katie here?
552.11s - 554.11s |  And an old woman answers the door and says,
554.11s - 556.11s |  there's no one here by that name.
556.11s - 558.11s |  I'm like, what?
558.11s - 560.11s |  Did I just get pwned by someone that I reached out to?
560.11s - 562.11s |  Because I put a deposit.
562.11s - 564.11s |  I flew from Los Angeles to Wisconsin,
564.11s - 566.11s |  and I'm just standing. I'm cold. I'm uncomfortable.
566.11s - 568.11s |  And the person that I paid is not here.
568.11s - 570.11s |  I look at my email.
570.11s - 572.11s |  We never contacted, we never called each other.
572.11s - 574.11s |  We just, like, chatted on LinkedIn.
574.11s - 576.11s |  And then I found her phone number. I call her.
576.11s - 578.11s |  It says, oh, I'm sorry. I switched the numbers.
578.11s - 580.11s |  Fortunately, she was down the street.
580.11s - 582.11s |  I walk down the street.
582.11s - 584.11s |  We go into Ian's glassblowing station.
584.11s - 586.11s |  So Ian and Katie are these two scientific glassblowers
586.11s - 588.11s |  that work for a big science company out,
588.11s - 590.11s |  excuse me, in Wisconsin.
590.11s - 592.11s |  And I go into their shop.
592.11s - 594.11s |  They show me their glassblowing lathe, their fume hood.
594.11s - 596.11s |  Here's Ian showing me
596.11s - 598.11s |  a lighter that he made.
598.11s - 600.11s |  Katie with her lightsaber.
600.11s - 602.11s |  That's fire.
602.11s - 604.11s |  If you ever want to learn how to glassblow
604.11s - 606.11s |  and you're in Wisconsin, you can email them, contact them.
606.11s - 608.11s |  And I came back learning a little bit more
608.11s - 610.11s |  about how to actually...
610.11s - 612.11s |  You wanted a pic?
612.11s - 614.11s |  I wanted a...
614.11s - 616.11s |  I came back home able to actually
616.11s - 618.11s |  blow a little bit more borosilicate glass,
618.11s - 620.11s |  which is great.
620.11s - 622.11s |  And when I came home, I was very excited,
622.11s - 624.11s |  and I started to reproduce some of these.
624.11s - 626.11s |  And I started to learn more about physics
626.11s - 628.11s |  and more about waves.
628.11s - 630.11s |  And one of the biggest realizations,
630.11s - 632.11s |  one of the most helpful realizations for me
632.11s - 634.11s |  is that I don't...
634.11s - 636.11s |  It's very difficult for me to understand complex things.
636.11s - 638.11s |  I don't understand complex things.
638.11s - 640.11s |  I can only understand simple things.
640.11s - 642.11s |  But I can take simple things and build
642.11s - 644.11s |  a simple thing into a module, a block,
644.11s - 646.11s |  and then use that block with another simple block
646.11s - 648.11s |  and then build stuff on top of that, right?
648.11s - 650.11s |  And if I can find patterns,
650.11s - 652.11s |  then that makes my life much easier.
652.11s - 654.11s |  I can just learn an abstract concept
654.11s - 656.11s |  of what X, Y, and Z are
656.11s - 658.11s |  if they're the same.
658.11s - 660.11s |  And we can interpret everything as waves,
660.11s - 662.11s |  as analog signals.
662.11s - 664.11s |  So a wave has three things that are important.
664.11s - 666.11s |  Now, when I say waves, light is a wave.
666.11s - 668.11s |  Sound is a wave.
668.11s - 670.11s |  Water waves are waves.
670.11s - 672.11s |  They all have the same properties.
672.11s - 674.11s |  They have absorption, where they absorb
674.11s - 676.11s |  and convert from one type of energy to another energy.
676.11s - 678.11s |  They have reflection.
678.11s - 680.11s |  They have refraction and diffraction.
680.11s - 682.11s |  A wave has three things.
682.11s - 684.11s |  There's the amplitude.
684.11s - 686.11s |  Amplitude means intensity.
686.11s - 688.11s |  So the sound would be how loud it is.
688.11s - 690.11s |  That's the amplitude.
690.11s - 692.11s |  With light, that's how bright it is.
692.11s - 694.11s |  Then there's the wavelength,
694.11s - 696.11s |  which directly relates to frequency.
696.11s - 698.11s |  So a low-frequency light would be red light.
698.11s - 700.11s |  A high-frequency light would be blue light or UV light.
700.11s - 702.11s |  With sound, low-frequency is bass.
702.11s - 704.11s |  High-frequency is higher sounds.
704.11s - 706.11s |  And there's phase, which is where something is
706.11s - 708.11s |  in its amplitude
708.11s - 710.11s |  because amplitude is moving up and down.
710.11s - 712.11s |  When we're dealing with computers,
712.11s - 714.11s |  we're digitizing things.
714.11s - 716.11s |  We're quantizing, which just means
716.11s - 718.11s |  our microphone, when I'm recording
718.11s - 720.11s |  my Metallica CDs,
720.11s - 722.11s |  or I'm backing up
722.11s - 724.11s |  my Metallica audio, of course,
724.11s - 726.11s |  I go into my microphone, let's say,
726.11s - 728.11s |  and that has a sample rate.
728.11s - 730.11s |  The sample rate is the number of times per second
730.11s - 732.11s |  I record, or a frame rate.
732.11s - 734.11s |  When you're taking a video,
734.11s - 736.11s |  if it's 30 frames per second, that's a sample rate.
736.11s - 738.11s |  If it's 30 hertz, 30 times per second.
738.11s - 740.11s |  And the bit rate, that's the depth.
740.11s - 742.11s |  So that's how much quality or resolution we have.
742.11s - 744.11s |  And these are really important factors.
744.11s - 746.11s |  Also, waves can do
746.11s - 748.11s |  very interesting things like interference.
748.11s - 750.11s |  So with interference, we can
750.11s - 752.11s |  do
752.11s - 754.11s |  constructive and destructive interference.
754.11s - 756.11s |  So your sound-canceling headphones,
756.11s - 758.11s |  when you put those on, they have microphones
758.11s - 760.11s |  on the outside, so that when you're listening
760.11s - 762.11s |  to the Metallica that you ripped,
762.11s - 764.11s |  you hear the
764.11s - 766.11s |  outside sound, and the microphone
766.11s - 768.11s |  takes that outside sound and it inverts the wave.
768.11s - 770.11s |  And then it plays it along with Metallica.
770.11s - 772.11s |  And those two cancel out.
772.11s - 774.11s |  Just like a water wave, with a high peak,
774.11s - 776.11s |  high amplitude, and a low amplitude.
776.11s - 778.11s |  If they hit, they will cancel out.
778.11s - 780.11s |  So that's destructive interference.
780.11s - 782.11s |  There's many other places online and on the
782.11s - 784.11s |  internet where you can get free tools
784.11s - 786.11s |  to learn about physics,
786.11s - 788.11s |  such as Veritasium's
788.11s - 790.11s |  channel. So Veritasium
790.11s - 792.11s |  has amazing videos on physics,
792.11s - 794.11s |  and there's so many interesting attacks
794.11s - 796.11s |  that we can do with light.
796.11s - 798.11s |  Here's Newton
798.11s - 800.11s |  actually designing the cover for Pink Floyd's
800.11s - 802.11s |  album, Dark Side of the Moon.
802.11s - 804.11s |  I always thought that it was
804.11s - 806.11s |  white light going to the prism and then refracting
806.11s - 808.11s |  into the rainbow, but we're reverse engineers,
808.11s - 810.11s |  so how do we know
810.11s - 812.11s |  it's the white light going in versus the
812.11s - 814.11s |  rainbow going to the prism and converting to white
814.11s - 816.11s |  light? We don't really know. That's an interesting
816.11s - 818.11s |  property of physics, is that physics,
818.11s - 820.11s |  almost everything works in reverse
820.11s - 822.11s |  as well. If you have a speaker,
822.11s - 824.11s |  then you're playing sound through that speaker.
824.11s - 826.11s |  If you have voltage going into the speaker,
826.11s - 828.11s |  that's electrons
828.11s - 830.11s |  moving through a coil.
830.11s - 832.11s |  Any moving charged particle
832.11s - 834.11s |  has a magnetic field.
834.11s - 836.11s |  That magnetic field is pushing the speaker cone
836.11s - 838.11s |  back and forth. That speaker cone
838.11s - 840.11s |  is then pushing air back and forth.
840.11s - 842.11s |  That's what the sound is. The sound is the movement
842.11s - 844.11s |  of matter.
844.11s - 846.11s |  The reverse is true as well.
846.11s - 848.11s |  If you have a speaker, and you have
848.11s - 850.11s |  air moving the speaker cone
850.11s - 852.11s |  because the speaker's not on, then the speaker
852.11s - 854.11s |  is also pushing
854.11s - 856.11s |  electrons back and forth, which then
856.11s - 858.11s |  produces a voltage in the coil.
858.11s - 860.11s |  Every speaker is a microphone.
860.11s - 862.11s |  Every microphone is also a speaker.
862.11s - 864.11s |  There are really poor quality versions, but it's true.
864.11s - 866.11s |  This is true with LEDs, for example.
866.11s - 868.11s |  Every LED can shine light,
868.11s - 870.11s |  but if you monitor the LED,
870.11s - 872.11s |  you can actually have the light convert to voltage,
872.11s - 874.11s |  and you can read light from an LED.
874.11s - 876.11s |  Everything works in reverse.
876.11s - 878.11s |  It's an important property.
878.11s - 880.11s |  These are ways that we can take advantage of
880.11s - 882.11s |  energy and energy conversion
882.11s - 884.11s |  and the way that things actually work at a fundamental level.
884.11s - 886.11s |  Here is a little bit of
886.11s - 888.11s |  the electromagnetic spectrum. We can see the different
888.11s - 890.11s |  colors, but it's also important to note
890.11s - 892.11s |  that, again, things like UV and IR, those are
892.11s - 894.11s |  light. Radio is also just another
894.11s - 896.11s |  type of light. It's just light we can't see.
896.11s - 898.11s |  It's colors we can't see.
898.11s - 900.11s |  FM radio. FM radio
900.11s - 902.11s |  is frequency modulation.
902.11s - 904.11s |  When you tune into 102.7,
904.11s - 906.11s |  you're listening to 102.7
906.11s - 908.11s |  megahertz on the electromagnetic
908.11s - 910.11s |  spectrum.
910.11s - 912.11s |  Now the frequency is modulating.
912.11s - 914.11s |  All that means is when there's
914.11s - 916.11s |  audio, if you have a 10 kilohertz tone,
916.11s - 918.11s |  it's a high-pitched tone,
918.11s - 920.11s |  that's 102.71.
920.11s - 922.11s |  102.7
922.11s - 924.11s |  megahertz plus 10 kilohertz.
924.11s - 926.11s |  Your frequency
926.11s - 928.11s |  is actually just moving up and down at 10 kilohertz.
928.11s - 930.11s |  You can think of an audio
930.11s - 932.11s |  wave going like this. If we just flip it
932.11s - 934.11s |  90 degrees, then it's actually going
934.11s - 936.11s |  like this, the frequency of the
936.11s - 938.11s |  spectrum. Amplitude modulation,
938.11s - 940.11s |  AM radio, when you listen to 98.7
940.11s - 942.11s |  AM, that's 98.7
942.11s - 944.11s |  kilohertz in the electromagnetic spectrum.
944.11s - 946.11s |  The amplitude is going up and down
946.11s - 948.11s |  to the sound.
948.11s - 950.11s |  You can do some really cool things with light. There's the light
950.11s - 952.11s |  commands research that people did where
952.11s - 954.11s |  they found that if they shine a laser
954.11s - 956.11s |  at something like a
956.11s - 958.11s |  Google Home, they can
958.11s - 960.11s |  say, hey Google, with light.
960.11s - 962.11s |  They just modulate the light.
962.11s - 964.11s |  They turn it on and off. Modulation
964.11s - 966.11s |  just means turning on and off or oscillating.
966.11s - 968.11s |  They turn it on and off to the frequency
968.11s - 970.11s |  of sound. If they record
970.11s - 972.11s |  their sound, hey Google,
972.11s - 974.11s |  unlock my door, and they
974.11s - 976.11s |  turn that light, that light hitting the
976.11s - 978.11s |  microphone is heating up. It's absorbing
978.11s - 980.11s |  inside of the microphone, the MEMS microphone,
980.11s - 982.11s |  and that produces heat. Heat
982.11s - 984.11s |  is vibration of particles.
984.11s - 986.11s |  That microphone then believes that it's hearing
986.11s - 988.11s |  sound. That means you can shine
988.11s - 990.11s |  through a window and trigger
990.11s - 992.11s |  the Google Home to do things for you.
992.11s - 994.11s |  There's also infrared light.
994.11s - 996.11s |  This is a Mark Rober did a
996.11s - 998.11s |  video showing just a thermal camera
998.11s - 1000.11s |  where he then pressed a pin
1000.11s - 1002.11s |  and heat is constantly transferring.
1002.11s - 1004.11s |  Just by touching these
1004.11s - 1006.11s |  buttons, heat from his finger goes to the
1006.11s - 1008.11s |  button and then leaves a mark. We don't
1008.11s - 1010.11s |  see it with our eyes, but with a thermal camera like a
1010.11s - 1012.11s |  FLIR camera, you can do that. Ultraviolet.
1012.11s - 1014.11s |  Ultra from Latin
1014.11s - 1016.11s |  meaning beyond, on the far side of.
1016.11s - 1018.11s |  On the far side of the visible spectrum.
1018.11s - 1020.11s |  Bunny did an amazing example with
1020.11s - 1022.11s |  ultraviolet light where he took a PIC
1022.11s - 1024.11s |  microcontroller that had firmware that he wanted to extract.
1024.11s - 1026.11s |  But the PIC microcontroller had
1026.11s - 1028.11s |  an E-fuse, an electronic fuse that said
1028.11s - 1030.11s |  do not allow anyone to debug and access
1030.11s - 1032.11s |  memory from this. And he opened it up,
1032.11s - 1034.11s |  he used nitric acid, sulfuric acid
1034.11s - 1036.11s |  to get to the silicon.
1036.11s - 1038.11s |  He covered up the area other than
1038.11s - 1040.11s |  the electronic fuses and then he shined
1040.11s - 1042.11s |  UV light which erased it.
1042.11s - 1044.11s |  That's how programmable read-only memory used to work.
1044.11s - 1046.11s |  We would shine UV light to erase it
1046.11s - 1048.11s |  and then we could program it.
1048.11s - 1050.11s |  Then there's radio, which again
1050.11s - 1052.11s |  is just another part of the spectrum. We talked about FM
1052.11s - 1054.11s |  a little bit. We talked about AM.
1054.11s - 1056.11s |  We're all familiar with, say, 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi
1056.11s - 1058.11s |  or Bluetooth. 5 GHz
1058.11s - 1060.11s |  Wi-Fi. Our microwaves, the microwave
1060.11s - 1062.11s |  that you make popcorn at home, that's
1062.11s - 1064.11s |  actually 2.4 GHz. Microwaves
1064.11s - 1066.11s |  and radio are the same exact thing.
1066.11s - 1068.11s |  There's the Tempest attack.
1068.11s - 1070.11s |  The NSA found in the 60s,
1070.11s - 1072.11s |  they knew that a CRT monitor, a cathode
1072.11s - 1074.11s |  ray tube, would constantly
1074.11s - 1076.11s |  emit radio frequency.
1076.11s - 1078.11s |  That radio frequency,
1078.11s - 1080.11s |  they could hear in an adjacent room.
1080.11s - 1082.11s |  They could essentially listen
1082.11s - 1084.11s |  to the radio frequency and see what's on the monitor.
1084.11s - 1086.11s |  There are modern attacks like this
1086.11s - 1088.11s |  today that are happening.
1088.11s - 1090.11s |  We talked a little bit about the AM and FM.
1090.11s - 1092.11s |  Then electromagnetism.
1092.11s - 1094.11s |  Electro from amber.
1094.11s - 1096.11s |  The Greeks found that when you rub amber
1096.11s - 1098.11s |  with something like fur,
1098.11s - 1100.11s |  they would attract or repel.
1100.11s - 1102.11s |  And magnetism
1102.11s - 1104.11s |  from magnesium stone. Because there's a
1104.11s - 1106.11s |  place called Magnesia where they found stone
1106.11s - 1108.11s |  and the stone was attracted to other magnesium
1108.11s - 1110.11s |  stones, we realized later, as magnetism.
1110.11s - 1112.11s |  This was an example project
1112.11s - 1114.11s |  a few years ago called MagSpoop.
1114.11s - 1116.11s |  I was interested in how the mag stripes actually work
1116.11s - 1118.11s |  within our credit cards.
1118.11s - 1120.11s |  And I put
1120.11s - 1122.11s |  my credit card inside of iron oxide
1122.11s - 1124.11s |  filings. And you can
1124.11s - 1126.11s |  actually read the ones and zeros off of my
1126.11s - 1128.11s |  credit card. I'm not even sure why I put the
1128.11s - 1130.11s |  electrical tape, because you can just read the credit card
1130.11s - 1132.11s |  number off the bits at the top.
1132.11s - 1134.11s |  I thought, what are all these numbers?
1134.11s - 1136.11s |  It's a credit card number. There's a CVV.
1136.11s - 1138.11s |  There's actually a separate CVV. There's a written one
1138.11s - 1140.11s |  and there's one in the mag stripe. Now we think,
1140.11s - 1142.11s |  who uses mag stripes? We all use chip or
1142.11s - 1144.11s |  NFC. But have you ever put your
1144.11s - 1146.11s |  credit card in a mag stripe machine?
1146.11s - 1148.11s |  It's like, hey, this is a chip card.
1148.11s - 1150.11s |  How does it know that it's a chip card?
1150.11s - 1152.11s |  The mag stripe tells it. The mag stripe
1152.11s - 1154.11s |  says, no, this is a chip card. You need higher security.
1154.11s - 1156.11s |  So what happens if you turn that one to a
1156.11s - 1158.11s |  zero and say, no, no, no, there's no chip on here.
1158.11s - 1160.11s |  There's no NFC.
1160.11s - 1162.11s |  This is the device.
1162.11s - 1164.11s |  This is the MagSmooth device, and it just
1164.11s - 1166.11s |  produces a magnetic field.
1166.11s - 1168.11s |  And if you
1168.11s - 1170.11s |  turn, I use the chip card, I put
1170.11s - 1172.11s |  the mag stripe data onto this
1172.11s - 1174.11s |  and was then able to
1174.11s - 1176.11s |  make transactions without the chip.
1176.11s - 1178.11s |  So if you just have access
1178.11s - 1180.11s |  to a mag stripe temporarily, you can then convert
1180.11s - 1182.11s |  the chip to a non-chip card.
1182.11s - 1184.11s |  There are some other interesting attacks.
1184.11s - 1186.11s |  There's sound.
1186.11s - 1188.11s |  There's so many interesting things that we can do with sound.
1188.11s - 1190.11s |  There's audible sound, which is what humans can hear.
1190.11s - 1192.11s |  We can hear 20 to 20 kilohertz.
1192.11s - 1194.11s |  I'm a little older.
1194.11s - 1196.11s |  I can maybe hear to 15 kilohertz.
1196.11s - 1198.11s |  If you listen to a lot of music,
1198.11s - 1200.11s |  you probably hear less.
1200.11s - 1202.11s |  Berkeley had some amazing research where they used
1202.11s - 1204.11s |  a microphone to listen to
1204.11s - 1206.11s |  the sound from a keyboard.
1206.11s - 1208.11s |  And there's a lot of research that I was able to
1208.11s - 1210.11s |  fortunately take advantage of
1210.11s - 1212.11s |  in using other people's tools and research
1212.11s - 1214.11s |  to learn how can I understand
1214.11s - 1216.11s |  what's happening on a keyboard.
1216.11s - 1218.11s |  There's something really interesting about all the information
1218.11s - 1220.11s |  that we are constantly inputting.
1220.11s - 1222.11s |  Maybe that's because I'm on a computer every single day typing.
1222.11s - 1224.11s |  I think it's cool to know that
1224.11s - 1226.11s |  what am I typing? What can someone figure out
1226.11s - 1228.11s |  what someone else is typing?
1228.11s - 1230.11s |  And they were able to just
1230.11s - 1232.11s |  have a microphone listen to what the sound
1232.11s - 1234.11s |  your computer is making and convert that back.
1234.11s - 1236.11s |  Two keys.
1236.11s - 1238.11s |  Ultrasound. Again,
1238.11s - 1240.11s |  ultra on the far side of.
1240.11s - 1242.11s |  The University of Tel Aviv
1242.11s - 1244.11s |  had some awesome research where they were using
1244.11s - 1246.11s |  a microphone from a standard
1246.11s - 1248.11s |  cell phone and they would listen to
1248.11s - 1250.11s |  the ultrasound coming from your computer.
1250.11s - 1252.11s |  As your computer is performing encryption operation,
1252.11s - 1254.11s |  let's say it's using RSA.
1254.11s - 1256.11s |  RSA, if you're encrypting a 1-bit versus 0-bit,
1256.11s - 1258.11s |  it takes different operations. It might do a
1258.11s - 1260.11s |  multiplication followed by a modular or an exponent
1260.11s - 1262.11s |  followed by a modular versus a multiplication.
1262.11s - 1264.11s |  And because of those different operations
1264.11s - 1266.11s |  take different amounts of power, that's different amounts
1266.11s - 1268.11s |  of power going through capacitors
1268.11s - 1270.11s |  and inductors of the CPU.
1270.11s - 1272.11s |  Those capacitors and inductors are producing
1272.11s - 1274.11s |  all these charged particles,
1274.11s - 1276.11s |  all these electrons moving, it's producing magnetism.
1276.11s - 1278.11s |  That magnetism is then moving things
1278.11s - 1280.11s |  on your CPU. So these actual
1280.11s - 1282.11s |  caps are moving within
1282.11s - 1284.11s |  your CPU and they're producing ultrasound
1284.11s - 1286.11s |  because they're moving at a frequency
1286.11s - 1288.11s |  higher than we can hear, above 20 kHz.
1288.11s - 1290.11s |  So if you can hear that with a microphone
1290.11s - 1292.11s |  in a lab environment, then you can
1292.11s - 1294.11s |  convert that back to 1s and 0s and extract
1294.11s - 1296.11s |  secret keys. Pretty amazing
1296.11s - 1298.11s |  stuff. All of this is really just
1298.11s - 1300.11s |  energy conversion. Everything that's happening
1300.11s - 1302.11s |  is a conversion of energy
1302.11s - 1304.11s |  and that's really interesting.
1304.11s - 1306.11s |  So how can we take advantage of energy conversion?
1306.11s - 1310.32s |  And I started to get interested
1310.32s - 1312.32s |  in laser microphones.
1312.32s - 1314.32s |  So I saw a talk 15 years ago here
1314.32s - 1316.32s |  at DEF CON and it was
1316.32s - 1318.32s |  incredible. It was about
1318.32s - 1320.32s |  how to use a laser microphone.
1320.32s - 1322.32s |  The first laser microphone, not really
1322.32s - 1324.32s |  a laser microphone, was really
1324.32s - 1326.32s |  a microphone that was, let's say,
1326.32s - 1328.32s |  passive.
1328.32s - 1330.32s |  It was from Leon Theremin.
1330.32s - 1332.32s |  If you're familiar with the Theremin instrument,
1332.32s - 1334.32s |  Leon Theremin
1334.32s - 1336.32s |  created this Theremin instrument. He was an engineer
1336.32s - 1338.32s |  and physicist. He also created something called
1338.32s - 1340.32s |  The Thing.
1340.32s - 1342.32s |  And he gave this to our friends at the KGB.
1342.32s - 1344.32s |  And The Thing was a passive
1344.32s - 1346.32s |  device. Many of us are familiar
1346.32s - 1348.32s |  with RFID devices. They're passive cards
1348.32s - 1350.32s |  and they go into a field,
1350.32s - 1352.32s |  an RFID field from, say, a reader.
1352.32s - 1354.32s |  And that reader emanates radio.
1354.32s - 1356.32s |  And that energizes the card. The card now has
1356.32s - 1358.32s |  enough power that it can run a little processor
1358.32s - 1360.32s |  and respond. Once it gets back,
1360.32s - 1362.32s |  this was the first implementation of RFID.
1362.32s - 1364.32s |  And instead of a card
1364.32s - 1366.32s |  with an ID, he put in
1366.32s - 1368.32s |  a microphone. And that microphone
1368.32s - 1370.32s |  then went into a seal. And this
1370.32s - 1372.32s |  was a gift that the Soviet Union
1372.32s - 1374.32s |  gave to the U.S. ambassador in
1374.32s - 1376.32s |  1945.
1376.32s - 1378.32s |  They put that. No battery,
1378.32s - 1380.32s |  right? No battery at all.
1380.32s - 1382.32s |  Because Leon Theremin realized
1382.32s - 1384.32s |  that he could passively power things.
1384.32s - 1386.32s |  He could power things from far and then get
1386.32s - 1388.32s |  information back.
1388.32s - 1390.32s |  It was many years before the U.S.
1390.32s - 1392.32s |  realized that there was a microphone.
1392.32s - 1394.32s |  Whenever that they were being powered from the outside,
1394.32s - 1396.32s |  they could get audio back.
1396.32s - 1398.32s |  Now, laser microphones is
1398.32s - 1400.32s |  a way of using light in order
1400.32s - 1402.32s |  to listen to sound.
1402.32s - 1404.32s |  So if I can shine a light at a window,
1404.32s - 1406.32s |  and the window, now sound.
1406.32s - 1408.32s |  Sound is the vibration
1408.32s - 1410.32s |  of matter. Typically air, right?
1410.32s - 1412.32s |  You can have sound go through
1412.32s - 1414.32s |  solid materials.
1414.32s - 1416.32s |  You can have sound go through water, liquids.
1416.32s - 1418.32s |  And you don't actually need a laser.
1418.32s - 1420.32s |  You just need light.
1420.32s - 1422.32s |  And the light can be visible or invisible,
1422.32s - 1424.32s |  as long as we have a way to receive it.
1424.32s - 1426.32s |  So it was this talk,
1426.32s - 1428.32s |  Sniffing Keystrokes with Lasers and Voltmeters,
1428.32s - 1430.32s |  by Andrea Barassani and
1430.32s - 1432.32s |  Danielle Bianco,
1432.32s - 1434.32s |  at DEFCON 17.
1434.32s - 1436.32s |  And this really blew my mind.
1436.32s - 1438.32s |  What they were able to do was they were able to
1438.32s - 1440.32s |  get laser at a reflective part
1440.32s - 1442.32s |  of a laptop within a room,
1442.32s - 1444.32s |  and then pick up the reflection
1444.32s - 1446.32s |  on a photodiode
1446.32s - 1448.32s |  or photoresistor. And they picked it up,
1448.32s - 1450.32s |  they plugged that into their sound card,
1450.32s - 1452.32s |  and they were able to listen to the keystrokes.
1452.32s - 1454.32s |  Now, it took a lot of work.
1454.32s - 1456.32s |  Definitely a proof of concept,
1456.32s - 1458.32s |  but absolutely incredible.
1458.32s - 1460.32s |  And I've always been interested in these keyboards.
1460.32s - 1462.32s |  A few years ago, I had released a project called
1462.32s - 1464.32s |  Keysweeper. Keysweeper is just
1464.32s - 1466.32s |  an Arduino-based device
1466.32s - 1468.32s |  that's inside of a USB charger.
1468.32s - 1470.32s |  You plug the USB charger into the wall,
1470.32s - 1472.32s |  and it's just sniffing every Microsoft wireless keyboard
1472.32s - 1474.32s |  in the vicinity. It also has a GSM chip,
1474.32s - 1476.32s |  so it's actually connected to a cell phone network.
1476.32s - 1478.32s |  It has a battery inside, so if it gets pulled out,
1478.32s - 1480.32s |  it continues to operate. And then you can
1480.32s - 1482.32s |  inject keystrokes, and you can listen to all
1482.32s - 1484.32s |  keyboards in the vicinity.
1484.32s - 1486.32s |  Fortunately, the FBI released a notice to the
1486.32s - 1488.32s |  industry saying, watch out for these Keysweeper devices.
1488.32s - 1490.32s |  And I read that someone sent that
1490.32s - 1492.32s |  to me, and I read it said,
1492.32s - 1494.32s |  limit which outlets are available for device charging.
1494.32s - 1496.32s |  Some suggestions just for all of us.
1496.32s - 1498.32s |  Know which chargers are
1498.32s - 1500.32s |  currently being used. Immediately
1500.32s - 1502.32s |  remove unknown chargers
1502.32s - 1504.32s |  whenever you see them. I don't think
1504.32s - 1506.32s |  they realize that it's really just the circuitry
1506.32s - 1508.32s |  inside the charger. The charger was just to be clandestine.
1508.32s - 1510.32s |  So you could put it
1510.32s - 1512.32s |  in a banana, at which point you would
1512.32s - 1514.32s |  have to limit which bananas are available for device.
1514.32s - 1516.32s |  You have to know whose bananas are
1516.32s - 1518.32s |  currently being used, and immediate removal of
1518.32s - 1520.32s |  any unknown bananas from the
1520.32s - 1522.32s |  office. So beware of bananas and USB
1522.32s - 1524.32s |  chargers. But keystrokes.
1524.32s - 1526.32s |  So these guys demonstrated
1526.32s - 1528.32s |  the components that they used.
1528.32s - 1530.32s |  Common laser, like off-the-shelf laser,
1530.32s - 1532.32s |  resistor, or battery.
1532.32s - 1534.32s |  And this was their schematic.
1534.32s - 1536.32s |  So what they did was, they had the laser
1536.32s - 1538.32s |  hit a laptop,
1538.32s - 1540.32s |  it would reflect off the laptop, and
1540.32s - 1542.32s |  then it would go into a photodiode
1542.32s - 1544.32s |  or photoresistor. They would power that,
1544.32s - 1546.32s |  and they would go into the microphone. And the reason for the microphone
1546.32s - 1548.32s |  is that that's an analog-to-digital converter.
1548.32s - 1550.32s |  That can convert the actual light waves.
1550.32s - 1552.32s |  So the photodiode converts the light waves
1552.32s - 1554.32s |  to electricity.
1554.32s - 1556.32s |  And that electricity is still a wave.
1556.32s - 1558.32s |  It's just like our AC. So our AC
1558.32s - 1560.32s |  that's producing 120 volts
1560.32s - 1562.32s |  RMS voltage in the
1562.32s - 1564.32s |  wall, that's traveling at
1564.32s - 1566.32s |  60 hertz. 60 times per second is moving
1566.32s - 1568.32s |  up and down.
1568.32s - 1570.32s |  And you can actually
1570.32s - 1572.32s |  take advantage of that.
1572.32s - 1574.32s |  I was curious, actually,
1574.32s - 1576.32s |  whether it really was 60 hertz.
1576.32s - 1578.32s |  So I had
1578.32s - 1580.32s |  connected a transformer
1580.32s - 1582.32s |  to my AC line, and converted that
1582.32s - 1584.32s |  120 volts down to 12 volts. And then I
1584.32s - 1586.32s |  measured the zero crossing every time it would cross zero.
1586.32s - 1588.32s |  Because I was curious, it says 60 hertz.
1588.32s - 1590.32s |  Does that actually mean 60 times per second?
1590.32s - 1592.32s |  Or does it mean, like, between 59
1592.32s - 1594.32s |  and 61? And I found that 60 hertz
1594.32s - 1596.32s |  is more accurate than the
1596.32s - 1598.32s |  clock in my phone. So if my
1598.32s - 1600.32s |  clock in my phone is not on Wi-Fi,
1600.32s - 1602.32s |  I can use the 60 hertz
1602.32s - 1604.32s |  from the wall to measure time, because it's
1604.32s - 1606.32s |  so accurate. And I didn't understand, why
1606.32s - 1608.32s |  is the wall, why is the 60 hertz so accurate?
1608.32s - 1610.32s |  Apparently it's connected to GPS. So if one
1610.32s - 1612.32s |  power station goes down, another
1612.32s - 1614.32s |  station can pick it up. But the interesting
1614.32s - 1616.32s |  thing is, it's not always accurate.
1616.32s - 1618.32s |  It would actually remain accurate only for a short period
1618.32s - 1620.32s |  of time, and then it would drift.
1620.32s - 1622.32s |  And I realized that you can take advantage of that drift,
1622.32s - 1624.32s |  and you can exploit that. So what you
1624.32s - 1626.32s |  can do, is you can say,
1626.32s - 1628.32s |  if I measure that drift over time,
1628.32s - 1630.32s |  you can take
1630.32s - 1632.32s |  that and use that as a fingerprint of a location.
1632.32s - 1634.32s |  Because every power station has its own unique fingerprint
1634.32s - 1636.32s |  of that drift. So if you put a
1636.32s - 1638.32s |  Raspberry Pi and a transformer in different
1638.32s - 1640.32s |  power stations, just in the
1640.32s - 1642.32s |  wall, you can have a public database
1642.32s - 1644.32s |  where you're all sending the drift of this
1644.32s - 1646.32s |  information, the 60 hertz signal.
1646.32s - 1648.32s |  And now whenever you have a recording, a video recording
1648.32s - 1650.32s |  or an audio recording, you can perform
1650.32s - 1652.32s |  a match and figure out where that audio recording
1652.32s - 1654.32s |  was taken, or where that video recording was
1654.32s - 1656.32s |  taken. Just another
1656.32s - 1658.32s |  interesting project that we can take advantage of.
1658.32s - 1660.32s |  And there's so much other interesting research
1660.32s - 1662.32s |  in the laser microphone and the keyboard acoustics.
1662.32s - 1664.32s |  Ben Nassie, he did
1664.32s - 1666.32s |  Lamp Phone, Glow Worm, many other
1666.32s - 1668.32s |  attacks. There's
1668.32s - 1670.32s |  the visual microphone, there's keyboard acoustic
1670.32s - 1672.32s |  side channels, keyboard acoustic emanations.
1672.32s - 1674.32s |  And I want to see, A, can I
1674.32s - 1676.32s |  implement this laser microphone? And B,
1676.32s - 1678.32s |  can I have some improvements?
1678.32s - 1680.32s |  And can I also hear sound? I want to hear sound
1680.32s - 1682.32s |  from a window. Now
1682.32s - 1684.32s |  first, it's really, really important
1684.32s - 1686.32s |  like, lasers are not a toy. I mean,
1686.32s - 1688.32s |  they're a lot of fun. Cats love them.
1688.32s - 1690.32s |  They're a toy to cats. But you can
1690.32s - 1692.32s |  oh my god,
1692.32s - 1694.32s |  you can burn your eyes, so you
1694.32s - 1696.32s |  do actually want to always use
1696.32s - 1698.32s |  laser safety glasses, goggles.
1698.32s - 1700.32s |  When you're buying a 5 milliwatt laser,
1700.32s - 1702.32s |  it doesn't mean it only outputs
1702.32s - 1704.32s |  5 milliwatts. It can output much more power.
1704.32s - 1706.32s |  America, we
1706.32s - 1708.32s |  have the ANSI standard Z136.1
1708.32s - 1710.32s |  Europe uses EN207. Make sure
1710.32s - 1712.32s |  you're getting from a laser safety
1712.32s - 1714.32s |  goggles from a reputable source.
1714.32s - 1716.32s |  And also for the wavelength, for the color
1716.32s - 1718.32s |  of light that you're working with.
1718.32s - 1720.32s |  Let's talk about hardware. So I first
1720.32s - 1722.32s |  tried to reimplement the
1722.32s - 1724.32s |  original
1724.32s - 1726.32s |  laser microphone, and
1726.32s - 1728.32s |  it took me a while to get it working.
1728.32s - 1730.32s |  And the sound quality wasn't great.
1730.32s - 1732.32s |  Now, it was still incredible. Like, as soon as you
1732.32s - 1734.32s |  get to hear sound,
1734.32s - 1736.32s |  that you're bouncing off a window, and then
1736.32s - 1738.32s |  reflecting back and picking up, and you can
1738.32s - 1740.32s |  hear what's going on inside,
1740.32s - 1742.32s |  it's a really magical feeling.
1742.32s - 1744.32s |  And I wanted to see, can I improve it? Can I improve
1744.32s - 1746.32s |  the quality? Because it just, it wasn't that great.
1746.32s - 1748.32s |  Here's my transmit side.
1748.32s - 1750.32s |  So we've updated the system
1750.32s - 1752.32s |  a little bit. The
1752.32s - 1754.32s |  primary things, the primary differences, for one
1754.32s - 1756.32s |  is, normally you just have a laser, and you
1756.32s - 1758.32s |  point it at the window. Every schematic,
1758.32s - 1760.32s |  every laser microphone I've ever
1760.32s - 1762.32s |  seen, simply has a constant
1762.32s - 1764.32s |  laser source, hitting something and
1764.32s - 1766.32s |  reflecting back. The problem
1766.32s - 1768.32s |  I found with this is that there's so much noise.
1768.32s - 1770.32s |  We have the 60 hertz noise from
1770.32s - 1772.32s |  the wall. We have all sorts of
1772.32s - 1774.32s |  noise from computers around. And all
1774.32s - 1776.32s |  of this stuff is typically low frequency noise
1776.32s - 1778.32s |  that is messing with your signal. And we need to
1778.32s - 1780.32s |  get rid of that.
1780.32s - 1782.32s |  I found a laser
1782.32s - 1784.32s |  driver, this was a laser
1784.32s - 1786.32s |  driver I had, that had something called
1786.32s - 1788.32s |  an RF bias T. And what this means is
1788.32s - 1790.32s |  it's a mixer. So you can have a constant
1790.32s - 1792.32s |  current source that's powering the laser, and
1792.32s - 1794.32s |  then you can have another source that's oscillating.
1794.32s - 1796.32s |  And I was thinking, well, what
1796.32s - 1798.32s |  they do in radio is that they'll
1798.32s - 1800.32s |  oscillate things at different frequencies to get away
1800.32s - 1802.32s |  from other frequencies that might be harming.
1802.32s - 1804.32s |  So what if we turn the laser on and off
1804.32s - 1806.32s |  in the RF domain? If we go into
1806.32s - 1808.32s |  radio, and we're turning that light on and off
1808.32s - 1810.32s |  at the radio frequencies?
1810.32s - 1812.32s |  Then we can actually get away
1812.32s - 1814.32s |  from all of that noise that we hear.
1814.32s - 1816.32s |  Here you can see the different parts
1816.32s - 1818.32s |  of this system. So the
1818.32s - 1820.32s |  oscilloscope in the top, I use that simply
1820.32s - 1822.32s |  because I have a signal generator built in.
1822.32s - 1824.32s |  It's a Rigol. I'll have the
1824.32s - 1826.32s |  full details, the full
1826.32s - 1828.32s |  bill of materials in a
1828.32s - 1830.32s |  future slide. But the current controller and
1830.32s - 1832.32s |  temperature controller, you do not need a temperature
1832.32s - 1834.32s |  controller, but that's just what I have at home.
1834.32s - 1836.32s |  Current controller for the constant current
1836.32s - 1838.32s |  source. In the top, there's that black box.
1838.32s - 1840.32s |  That's the laser driver.
1840.32s - 1842.32s |  There's also the RF mixer built
1842.32s - 1844.32s |  into that. I use a collimating lens.
1844.32s - 1846.32s |  So what collimation means is
1846.32s - 1848.32s |  collimation means it just takes light and
1848.32s - 1850.32s |  tries to make it into a single dot.
1850.32s - 1852.32s |  Or a straight...
1852.32s - 1854.32s |  If you take a flashlight, you typically have
1854.32s - 1856.32s |  an unfocused beam of light. A collimated
1856.32s - 1858.32s |  beam is a beam that does not focus
1858.32s - 1860.32s |  or defocus. I used to think a laser,
1860.32s - 1862.32s |  what made a laser a laser
1862.32s - 1864.32s |  was that it was collimated, that it was a straight line.
1864.32s - 1866.32s |  And that's not true. It's not
1866.32s - 1868.32s |  collimation. What makes a laser
1868.32s - 1870.32s |  a laser is that it's coherent. And all
1870.32s - 1872.32s |  that means is that the phase of light coming out
1872.32s - 1874.32s |  is always the same. It always starts at the same
1874.32s - 1876.32s |  place. It's not important for this attack.
1876.32s - 1878.32s |  Just something I thought that was interesting for
1878.32s - 1880.32s |  me to understand what a laser
1880.32s - 1882.32s |  is. The flexor, that just lets
1882.32s - 1884.32s |  us actually direct
1884.32s - 1886.32s |  the light up and down very easily.
1886.32s - 1888.32s |  A shutter is to really tighten our
1888.32s - 1890.32s |  beam. So even though we have a collimation
1890.32s - 1892.32s |  and we're collimating this laser beam, we want
1892.32s - 1894.32s |  to get a really tight beam. So a shutter just
1894.32s - 1896.32s |  lets us close that even further.
1896.32s - 1898.32s |  And behind the lens, there's
1898.32s - 1900.32s |  a laser diode. And all of these you can
1900.32s - 1902.32s |  buy separately. And the nice thing is that with a laser
1902.32s - 1904.32s |  diode, I can use a red light normally
1904.32s - 1906.32s |  when testing, but then I can move to
1906.32s - 1908.32s |  the infrared where we don't see it.
1908.32s - 1910.32s |  So these are the
1910.32s - 1912.32s |  actual components I'm using.
1912.32s - 1914.32s |  The obligatory turn on the fog
1914.32s - 1916.32s |  and check out the cool red laser
1916.32s - 1918.32s |  beam.
1918.32s - 1920.32s |  Then we want to actually receive that
1920.32s - 1922.32s |  information. So how do we receive it? The typical
1922.32s - 1924.32s |  setup is we have a photo diode and a sound card.
1924.32s - 1926.32s |  But what we're doing is we're
1926.32s - 1928.32s |  modulating. So with a signal generator, we start
1928.32s - 1930.32s |  modulating this thing at hundreds of
1930.32s - 1932.32s |  thousands of times
1932.32s - 1934.32s |  per second. So the sound,
1934.32s - 1936.32s |  humans can hear between 20 hertz and 20
1936.32s - 1938.32s |  kilohertz. So I want that sound.
1938.32s - 1940.32s |  But I want
1940.32s - 1942.32s |  to then get away from those low frequencies
1942.32s - 1944.32s |  because there's so much electromagnetism
1944.32s - 1946.32s |  at those frequencies that it's
1946.32s - 1948.32s |  disrupting the signal I'm getting.
1948.32s - 1950.32s |  Because we're getting very little light back from
1950.32s - 1952.32s |  the laser that's reflecting
1952.32s - 1954.32s |  off a window or off
1954.32s - 1956.32s |  a computer.
1956.32s - 1958.32s |  So first, and the sound
1958.32s - 1960.32s |  card can only listen to, say, 48
1960.32s - 1962.32s |  kilohertz or 192 kilohertz.
1962.32s - 1964.32s |  To get away from all that sound,
1964.32s - 1966.32s |  we modulate the laser. We turn the laser
1966.32s - 1968.32s |  on and off 400,000 times per second
1968.32s - 1970.32s |  so that we're at 400 kilohertz.
1970.32s - 1972.32s |  So we need something other than a sound card
1972.32s - 1974.32s |  that can actually accept this.
1974.32s - 1976.32s |  So first, I thought, okay,
1976.32s - 1978.32s |  well, I can use a bunch of analog components.
1978.32s - 1980.32s |  The problem with analog components and electronic circuitry
1980.32s - 1982.32s |  is it's a huge pain. So as you're
1982.32s - 1984.32s |  putting these little components on a circuit board, for one,
1984.32s - 1986.32s |  you're dealing with high frequencies. So as you're
1986.32s - 1988.32s |  trying to change, as you're trying different
1988.32s - 1990.32s |  filters and amplifiers, all of this
1990.32s - 1992.32s |  is very difficult. And think, man,
1992.32s - 1994.32s |  I really wish I could use GNU Radio.
1994.32s - 1996.32s |  GNU Radio is open source signal processing software.
1996.32s - 1998.32s |  And with that, then I can drag and drop
1998.32s - 2000.32s |  and life is just great. I can, like, sit back
2000.32s - 2002.32s |  in my chair, drink some caffeine,
2002.32s - 2004.32s |  and just play with these little blocks
2004.32s - 2006.32s |  and just test different things to see what works.
2006.32s - 2008.32s |  The problem, the challenge
2008.32s - 2010.32s |  with using GNU Radio is that I need, then,
2010.32s - 2012.32s |  a software-defined radio to pull that data in.
2012.32s - 2014.32s |  The sound card won't work because I need something
2014.32s - 2016.32s |  that can listen to not only 400 kilohertz,
2016.32s - 2018.32s |  I need to go at least double that.
2018.32s - 2020.32s |  It's called Nyquist theorem. I need to go to at least
2020.32s - 2022.32s |  800 kilohertz of a sample rate,
2022.32s - 2024.32s |  how fast I'm listening to that data.
2024.32s - 2026.32s |  And I can use a software-defined radio,
2026.32s - 2028.32s |  but software-defined radios don't ever go that low.
2028.32s - 2030.32s |  So, the RTL-SDR,
2030.32s - 2032.32s |  I'm not sure where that goes, maybe 100 megahertz.
2032.32s - 2034.32s |  Excuse me.
2034.32s - 2036.32s |  The HAKR-F, amazing. I love the HAKR-F,
2036.32s - 2038.32s |  but the minimum frequency
2038.32s - 2040.32s |  it can listen to is
2040.32s - 2042.32s |  at about, let's see,
2042.32s - 2044.32s |  1 megahertz, and we're at 400 kilohertz.
2044.32s - 2046.32s |  The USRP,
2046.32s - 2048.32s |  it also has a very low bit rate,
2048.32s - 2050.32s |  so it's about, the analog-to-digital converter
2050.32s - 2052.32s |  has an 8-bit sample rate.
2052.32s - 2054.32s |  And we want higher samples. We want higher resolution
2054.32s - 2056.32s |  so we can extract more signal.
2056.32s - 2058.32s |  The USRP-B210
2058.32s - 2060.32s |  has 12 bits,
2060.32s - 2062.32s |  which is good, but it requires
2062.32s - 2064.32s |  70 megahertz, and we're just down at
2064.32s - 2066.32s |  400 kilohertz.
2066.32s - 2068.32s |  But, then I started looking, and there was something
2068.32s - 2070.32s |  called an up-converter that we can get.
2070.32s - 2072.32s |  So, the up-converter actually adds 125 megahertz
2072.32s - 2074.32s |  to a signal, as long as it's at least
2074.32s - 2076.32s |  100 kilohertz. So, we're at 400 kilohertz.
2076.32s - 2078.32s |  So, ultimately, what I use is a
2078.32s - 2080.32s |  photodiode. I go into an amplifier.
2080.32s - 2082.32s |  That amplifier then goes into a
2082.32s - 2084.32s |  Hammond-up V2.
2084.32s - 2086.32s |  That adds 125 megahertz to our 400
2086.32s - 2088.32s |  kilohertz, so now we're at 125.4
2088.32s - 2090.32s |  megahertz. Then I go into
2090.32s - 2092.32s |  the USRP. Now
2092.32s - 2094.32s |  that can go into my computer. Here's the
2094.32s - 2096.32s |  physical setup. This is the receiving
2096.32s - 2098.32s |  side. Lens, to capture
2098.32s - 2100.32s |  light, into a photodiode, into the amp,
2100.32s - 2102.32s |  into the USRP-B210,
2102.32s - 2104.32s |  into the computer.
2104.32s - 2106.32s |  If you see this outside of your window,
2106.32s - 2108.32s |  it is super sketchy.
2108.32s - 2110.32s |  Maybe, like, shut the blinds,
2110.32s - 2112.32s |  call the police.
2112.32s - 2114.32s |  But, once you actually point this laser
2114.32s - 2116.32s |  at a computer, now there
2116.32s - 2118.32s |  are some big challenges here. Actually,
2118.32s - 2120.32s |  performing alignment is very, very,
2120.32s - 2122.32s |  very challenging. Getting sound
2122.32s - 2124.32s |  is actually not so challenging, because
2124.32s - 2126.32s |  our ears, we're pretty good at listening to
2126.32s - 2128.32s |  just one kilohertz of sound. Although
2128.32s - 2130.32s |  we can hear up to 20 kilohertz, just
2130.32s - 2132.32s |  one kilohertz, we can usually make out
2132.32s - 2134.32s |  what someone is saying.
2134.32s - 2136.32s |  Getting above, I'd say,
2136.32s - 2138.32s |  four kilo, like, the best I was able to get
2138.32s - 2140.32s |  above was four to five
2140.32s - 2142.32s |  kilohertz of sound. And I found
2142.32s - 2144.32s |  for keystroke extraction, I needed to get to
2144.32s - 2146.32s |  three kilohertz. If I got to 2.5
2146.32s - 2148.32s |  kilohertz, I could not convert anything to keystrokes.
2148.32s - 2150.32s |  If I got to three kilohertz,
2150.32s - 2152.32s |  I could start converting to keystrokes.
2152.32s - 2154.32s |  Here's the hardware on the
2154.32s - 2156.32s |  transmit side, just the actual components,
2156.32s - 2158.32s |  just so you know.
2158.32s - 2160.32s |  Here is the RX side.
2160.32s - 2162.32s |  This will all be online, so if you want to know
2162.32s - 2164.32s |  the exact components I used. And one
2164.32s - 2166.32s |  of the other improvements that I wanted to make here,
2166.32s - 2168.32s |  for one, now that we're getting into the RF
2168.32s - 2170.32s |  domain, we get away from all this noise.
2170.32s - 2172.32s |  And we can actually filter out that noise.
2172.32s - 2174.32s |  Another cool thing is I wanted to do this in
2174.32s - 2176.32s |  infrared. I don't want someone seeing
2176.32s - 2178.32s |  me standing outside pointing a laser into
2178.32s - 2180.32s |  their window. That's just too obvious.
2180.32s - 2182.32s |  So I got an infrared
2182.32s - 2184.32s |  laser diode. And how do I
2184.32s - 2186.32s |  actually align to the infrared? Because I can't see
2186.32s - 2188.32s |  it. So I got this infrared camera.
2188.32s - 2190.32s |  It's the X-Nite USB 2S
2190.32s - 2192.32s |  M. It's around $120. It's
2192.32s - 2194.32s |  very cool. It's actually very exciting to be able to see
2194.32s - 2196.32s |  infrared just around
2196.32s - 2198.32s |  you. And it's
2198.32s - 2200.32s |  maybe hard to tell, but I have the laser
2200.32s - 2202.32s |  diode going and just
2202.32s - 2204.32s |  hitting a white square.
2204.32s - 2206.32s |  And you can't see it on my camera, my phone
2206.32s - 2208.32s |  camera, because my phone camera also can't see
2208.32s - 2210.32s |  IR. And my eyes can't see IR.
2210.32s - 2212.32s |  And then here, just so we can see,
2212.32s - 2214.32s |  I made a recording with that
2214.32s - 2216.32s |  camera pointing the laser at
2216.32s - 2218.32s |  my laptop. And you can kind of see the reflection.
2218.32s - 2220.32s |  I'm sitting below the
2220.32s - 2222.32s |  laptop with a steam iron.
2222.32s - 2224.32s |  And I'm just like steaming my
2224.32s - 2226.32s |  laptop until, I think it was
2226.32s - 2228.32s |  the first time I ever used a steam iron,
2228.32s - 2230.32s |  until boiling water boiled
2230.32s - 2232.32s |  down on me. And I was like, ah. So I got maybe
2232.32s - 2234.32s |  a few seconds before I burnt myself.
2234.32s - 2236.32s |  But while I was doing this testing, I also saw
2236.32s - 2238.32s |  something else interesting. I pulled out my
2238.32s - 2240.32s |  phone, and I wanted to change
2240.32s - 2242.32s |  the song, because Spotify was playing.
2242.32s - 2244.32s |  And when I unlocked my phone,
2244.32s - 2246.32s |  I saw these dots, not on the
2246.32s - 2248.32s |  wall, but I saw it on the IR
2248.32s - 2250.32s |  recording.
2250.32s - 2252.32s |  And I'm like, wait, what's happening?
2252.32s - 2254.32s |  When my phone, when I pulled out my phone,
2254.32s - 2256.32s |  I realized, this is
2256.32s - 2258.32s |  LiDAR. So my phone is using
2258.32s - 2260.32s |  LiDAR on the back. I'm like, why? Why is it
2260.32s - 2262.32s |  projecting all of these infrared dots that we cannot
2262.32s - 2264.32s |  see with our eyes? And it only happens when
2264.32s - 2266.32s |  the camera app is open.
2266.32s - 2268.32s |  And it's actually very cool. It's figuring out
2268.32s - 2270.32s |  how far is the object,
2270.32s - 2272.32s |  how far is it? And if it's
2272.32s - 2274.32s |  close, it's going to use the close camera.
2274.32s - 2276.32s |  You have a bunch of cameras on the back of your phone.
2276.32s - 2278.32s |  So it's deciding which camera to
2278.32s - 2280.32s |  use. So when you go closer to an object,
2280.32s - 2282.32s |  it will automatically switch to a different camera.
2282.32s - 2284.32s |  And I thought, that's really cool, but
2284.32s - 2286.32s |  what if I can actually measure this?
2286.32s - 2288.32s |  So I put this in my spectrometer just to see
2288.32s - 2290.32s |  what wavelength of infrared
2290.32s - 2292.32s |  this was, because now we can just monitor
2292.32s - 2294.32s |  for this wavelength of light.
2294.32s - 2296.32s |  So imagine you have a little device with a photo
2296.32s - 2298.32s |  diode, a photo sensor
2298.32s - 2300.32s |  on you, so that whenever someone points
2300.32s - 2302.32s |  their phone camera at you, you get
2302.32s - 2304.32s |  a little vibration. Because you
2304.32s - 2306.32s |  can just measure for that frequency of light, and for
2306.32s - 2308.32s |  that on and off path. And now
2308.32s - 2310.32s |  you can know when someone points their phone
2310.32s - 2312.32s |  camera at you before they're even recording.
2312.32s - 2314.32s |  And it only will show,
2314.32s - 2316.32s |  you can see that sort of rectangle
2316.32s - 2318.32s |  that's exactly the same path.
2318.32s - 2320.32s |  That means I could just
2320.32s - 2322.32s |  make all of you vibrate right now.
2322.32s - 2324.32s |  How fun would that be?
2324.32s - 2326.32s |  So, separate project. We'll do that
2326.32s - 2328.32s |  another time. So there's the RF modulation.
2328.32s - 2330.32s |  This is the biggest improvement that I've seen
2330.32s - 2332.32s |  in this laser microphone. So actually getting
2332.32s - 2334.32s |  into the RF domain.
2334.32s - 2336.32s |  The photo diode I used, this is the
2336.32s - 2338.32s |  Spot 2D. It's pretty interesting, it actually
2338.32s - 2340.32s |  has two cells. So where photo
2340.32s - 2342.32s |  diodes are typically one pixel, this is really two pixels.
2342.32s - 2344.32s |  The hardest challenge, the
2344.32s - 2346.32s |  biggest challenge of this whole system is that you must
2346.32s - 2348.32s |  get essentially to the edge of the diode.
2348.32s - 2350.32s |  You don't want to get the light in the center, you want to get
2350.32s - 2352.32s |  to the edge. Because as soon as the edge,
2352.32s - 2354.32s |  you essentially want your light,
2354.32s - 2356.32s |  your reflection to go on and off that diode.
2356.32s - 2358.32s |  If you're in the center, then you're just gonna
2358.32s - 2360.32s |  you're not gonna get much variation.
2360.32s - 2362.32s |  But if you're at the edge, that's where you get all the variation.
2362.32s - 2364.32s |  There I noticed there was a hair
2364.32s - 2366.32s |  in their photo. Fortunately there was
2366.32s - 2368.32s |  no hair in the photo diode they sent me, so I didn't have
2368.32s - 2370.32s |  to send it back. And then
2370.32s - 2372.32s |  the software that we use. So we use some
2372.32s - 2374.32s |  awesome software. First,
2374.32s - 2377.95s |  Guneo Radio. And we'll
2377.95s - 2379.95s |  quickly go through the steps here, but all
2379.95s - 2381.95s |  this will be online as well.
2381.95s - 2383.95s |  So Guneo Radio, all the red stuff on the left,
2383.95s - 2385.95s |  those are just variables. That just makes it
2385.95s - 2387.95s |  easier for me to, just like in software,
2387.95s - 2389.95s |  to use a single variable that will change things
2389.95s - 2391.95s |  in multiple areas. The things
2391.95s - 2393.95s |  circled in blue, those are just
2393.95s - 2395.95s |  GUI, those are just graphical
2395.95s - 2397.95s |  syncs, so we can see information.
2397.95s - 2399.95s |  The heart of it,
2399.95s - 2401.95s |  the heart of the Guneo Radio stuff is, first
2401.95s - 2403.95s |  we start with our USRP source.
2403.95s - 2405.95s |  So this
2405.95s - 2407.95s |  pulls in data at a sample rate of 4.8
2407.95s - 2409.95s |  megahertz, or mega samples per second.
2409.95s - 2411.95s |  Our center frequency is
2411.95s - 2413.95s |  125.2 megahertz.
2413.95s - 2415.95s |  So 125 megahertz because of the
2415.95s - 2417.95s |  RF upconverter, the Hamminup, and then
2417.95s - 2419.95s |  200 kilohertz. Now, we're
2419.95s - 2421.95s |  actually modulating at 400 kilohertz,
2421.95s - 2423.95s |  but we don't want to listen at 400 kilohertz because
2423.95s - 2425.95s |  there's something called the DC spike. Any software
2425.95s - 2427.95s |  divine radio is going to give you this giant DC
2427.95s - 2429.95s |  spike, and you want to move away from that, and
2429.95s - 2431.95s |  then you filter out that DC spike, and then you can
2431.95s - 2433.95s |  listen to the actual data you want.
2433.95s - 2435.95s |  We mentioned a couple
2435.95s - 2437.95s |  different SDRs. The reason I chose the
2437.95s - 2439.95s |  B210 was because it had a high
2439.95s - 2441.95s |  resolution, or bitrate, and
2441.95s - 2443.95s |  it had a high sample rate.
2443.95s - 2445.95s |  You can also use a Salier logic analyzer.
2445.95s - 2447.95s |  I realize this is also actually a pretty nice
2447.95s - 2449.95s |  50 mega samples
2449.95s - 2451.95s |  per second is also 12 bits.
2451.95s - 2453.95s |  Then we go into
2453.95s - 2455.95s |  a translating FIR filter.
2455.95s - 2457.95s |  This is three things. First, it's a
2457.95s - 2459.95s |  bandpass filter. Oh, first, it
2459.95s - 2461.95s |  actually changes the frequency you're at.
2461.95s - 2463.95s |  So we want to go from
2463.95s - 2465.95s |  125.2 to
2465.95s - 2467.95s |  125.4. That's where our sound is.
2467.95s - 2469.95s |  So now we're centered on the sound,
2469.95s - 2471.95s |  and the sound is moving up and
2471.95s - 2473.95s |  down. So our signal is
2473.95s - 2475.95s |  some sort of sound wave, but
2475.95s - 2477.95s |  our amplitude modulated signal is at
2477.95s - 2479.95s |  400 kilohertz. So it's going up and down.
2479.95s - 2481.95s |  So the FIR
2481.95s - 2483.95s |  filter will also then do a bandpass.
2483.95s - 2485.95s |  So now we're saying, I only want what's
2485.95s - 2487.95s |  around the 400 megahertz.
2487.95s - 2489.95s |  Excuse me, 400 kilohertz. Everything else we can
2489.95s - 2491.95s |  ignore. So we bandpass that out, and
2491.95s - 2493.95s |  then we decimate. Decimate just brings
2493.95s - 2495.95s |  the sample rate down to a more usable
2495.95s - 2497.95s |  sample rate. Then we go into
2497.95s - 2499.95s |  and we amplitude demodulate.
2499.95s - 2501.95s |  So we convert the AM back
2501.95s - 2503.95s |  into the actual sound. So now we
2503.95s - 2505.95s |  can hear sound, and then we save the file.
2505.95s - 2507.95s |  Then we use something called iZotope
2507.95s - 2509.95s |  RX. This is absolutely incredible software.
2509.95s - 2511.95s |  It's commercial software, but it's
2511.95s - 2513.95s |  very good. It's great at spectral
2513.95s - 2515.95s |  repair, and it gives you a spectrograph. So you can
2515.95s - 2517.95s |  actually see what's happening inside of your signal.
2517.95s - 2519.95s |  And then you can do all sorts of things like
2519.95s - 2521.95s |  de-s, de-hum, de-splosive.
2521.95s - 2523.95s |  I have no idea what de-splosive is.
2523.95s - 2525.95s |  But it has a lot of ways
2525.95s - 2527.95s |  that you can then improve the signal. So you can
2527.95s - 2529.95s |  say, hey, I want to learn this area of
2529.95s - 2531.95s |  sound where there's just a lot of noise.
2531.95s - 2533.95s |  Learn that, and now apply it to the rest of the signal
2533.95s - 2535.95s |  and remove that noise.
2535.95s - 2537.95s |  FFmpeg, just so we can actually convert some things
2537.95s - 2539.95s |  around. And then KeyTap3
2539.95s - 2541.95s |  is really the heart of the system for the
2541.95s - 2543.95s |  keystroke extraction. We want to know what the person
2543.95s - 2545.95s |  is typing. And I like
2545.95s - 2547.95s |  this guy's GitHub. He says, I like big VMRC
2547.95s - 2549.95s |  and I cannot lie.
2549.95s - 2551.95s |  So KeyTap3 is part of this
2551.95s - 2553.95s |  software where he takes audio
2553.95s - 2555.95s |  and he's able to then separate
2555.95s - 2557.95s |  out the keystrokes. Now what's interesting
2557.95s - 2559.95s |  is that when you have a keyboard and you press some keys
2559.95s - 2561.95s |  on it, every key produces a
2561.95s - 2563.95s |  unique sound. Now we're not
2563.95s - 2565.95s |  recording sound, we're recording vibration
2565.95s - 2567.95s |  because we're hitting the laptop
2567.95s - 2569.95s |  and reflecting off. And when someone
2569.95s - 2571.95s |  is typing on that laptop, the sound
2571.95s - 2573.95s |  is just vibration. And vibration matter.
2573.95s - 2575.95s |  So the laptop is vibrating.
2575.95s - 2577.95s |  It's literally vibrating. And because every
2577.95s - 2579.95s |  unique key has a position, just
2579.95s - 2581.95s |  like if you hit a drum. If you take a drum and you
2581.95s - 2583.95s |  hit it in one location, you're producing one sound.
2583.95s - 2585.95s |  If you hit it slightly somewhere else, it produces a
2585.95s - 2587.95s |  slightly different sound. You can record that
2587.95s - 2589.95s |  and you can differentiate those two sounds.
2589.95s - 2591.95s |  Then you can figure out where they've actually
2591.95s - 2593.95s |  hit. Now on a keyboard, you don't know
2593.95s - 2595.95s |  what they're typing. You don't actually know
2595.95s - 2597.95s |  what they're hitting. But if you've collected
2597.95s - 2599.95s |  over 100 or 200 keystrokes
2599.95s - 2601.95s |  and you know the language they're
2601.95s - 2603.95s |  typing in, then you can perform
2603.95s - 2605.95s |  analysis and say
2605.95s - 2607.95s |  frequency analysis. Like what are they
2607.95s - 2609.95s |  actually typing? This is a Zodiac Killer.
2609.95s - 2611.95s |  So he would release
2611.95s - 2613.95s |  these puzzles that are essentially
2613.95s - 2615.95s |  substitution ciphers. You can
2615.95s - 2617.95s |  take all encryption and break it down into substitution
2617.95s - 2619.95s |  cipher and transposition
2619.95s - 2621.95s |  cipher.
2621.95s - 2623.95s |  Just
2623.95s - 2625.95s |  some examples. I love the outdoors.
2625.95s - 2627.95s |  So going and as well
2627.95s - 2629.95s |  as pointing lasers. So a couple demonstrations
2629.95s - 2631.95s |  of the setup.
2631.95s - 2633.95s |  Here we can see what this actually looks
2633.95s - 2635.95s |  like as you're pointing the laser
2635.95s - 2637.95s |  onto a reflective surface of a laptop.
2637.95s - 2639.95s |  We'll just see the KeyTap
2639.95s - 2641.95s |  software. FFmpeg and KeyTap running.
2641.95s - 2646.16s |  This is at 10x speed.
2646.16s - 2648.16s |  Gonna be very hard to see, but the next slide
2648.16s - 2650.16s |  I will do a little screenshot
2650.16s - 2652.16s |  so we can compare.
2652.16s - 2654.16s |  Again, that's 10x speed. So here's
2654.16s - 2656.16s |  typing on a keyboard, what I
2656.16s - 2658.16s |  typed, and then what KeyTap 3 was able
2658.16s - 2660.16s |  to recover. This is after going
2660.16s - 2662.16s |  through the setup, after going through
2662.16s - 2664.16s |  GNU Radio, then iZotope RX
2664.16s - 2666.16s |  with a lot of cleanup. Again, I needed
2666.16s - 2668.16s |  to collect at least 3 kHz
2668.16s - 2670.16s |  of sound. And also just
2670.16s - 2672.16s |  an example of what the sound
2672.16s - 2674.16s |  actually sounds like.
2674.16s - 2676.16s |  This was playing music inside of a
2676.16s - 2678.16s |  room and then reflecting off the window.
2680.16s - 2682.16s |  And you can hear a little bit
2682.16s - 2698.85s |  of that sound.
2698.85s - 2700.85s |  And that is the project.
2700.85s - 2702.85s |  The challenges, I mean, this
2702.85s - 2704.85s |  was really interesting. How do you get rid of noise?
2704.85s - 2706.85s |  This whole thing was really
2706.85s - 2708.85s |  signal processing. And the
2708.85s - 2710.85s |  improvements to the laser microphone, the biggest thing
2710.85s - 2712.85s |  to the laser microphone was really
2712.85s - 2714.85s |  getting outside of the sound
2714.85s - 2716.85s |  domain, getting into the radio domain.
2716.85s - 2718.85s |  Once you get into there, then you have a lot more
2718.85s - 2720.85s |  processing capabilities and you have
2720.85s - 2722.85s |  all the sound, a ton of noise
2722.85s - 2724.85s |  that was there, is gone.
2724.85s - 2726.85s |  And there are plenty of improvements
2726.85s - 2728.85s |  we can make, we can discuss
2728.85s - 2730.85s |  later, but thank you so much.
2730.85s - 2732.85s |  I appreciate your time.
