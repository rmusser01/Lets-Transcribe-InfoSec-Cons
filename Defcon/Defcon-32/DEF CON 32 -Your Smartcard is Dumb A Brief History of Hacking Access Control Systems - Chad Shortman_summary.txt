**Introduction to Access Control Systems**
- **Access control systems**: Mechanisms used to control who can access certain areas or resources.
- The presentation explores how **access-control systems** work, including **smart cards**, their vulnerabilities, and various **attacks**.

**Components of Access Control Systems**
- **Door Reader**: The device where users tap their card.
- **Controller Board**: Makes the decision to unlock the door based on database comparisons.
- **Mag Lock**: Electromagnet used to keep doors shut, requires a button to cut power in emergencies.

**Vulnerabilities and Attacks**
- **Relays**: Simple electronic switches that can be exploited with physical tools such as magnets or metal pieces.
- **Motion Sensors**: Can be triggered by smoke from vapes to unlock doors.
- **Smart Cards**: Various types with differing levels of security, including those with **RFID** and **NFC** technologies.

**Smart Cards Explained**
- **Mag Stripe Cards**: Store data with no security or encryption.
- **Prox Cards**: Use radio waves to communicate; generally lack encryption.
- **NFC Cards**: Use cryptography and require a symmetric key for reading/writing.
- **True Smart Cards**: Contain microprocessors capable of **public key cryptography**, providing better security.

**Historical Attacks on Smart Cards**
- **My Fair Classic**: Early smart card widely used and subsequently broken.
- **HID Readers**: Utilized symmetric keys vulnerable to cloning and other attacks.
- **Elite Keys**: Meant to provide higher security but still susceptible to attacks.

**Challenges in Current Systems**
- **Bad Implementations**: Common feature in insecure systems.
- **Scalability Issues**: High-security cards often lack scalability for widespread use.
- **Hardware Update Challenges**: Physical tokens canâ€™t be updated like software, leading to prolonged vulnerabilities.

**Future Directions**
- **Smartphones as Replacements**: Potential to replace smart cards using **secure elements** and **trusted execution environments**.
- **Secure Elements in Phones**: Already present in all smartphones, used for secure transactions such as tap-to-pay.
- **Trust Zone in ARM Processors**: Provides a secure environment for sensitive operations.

**The Role of Cryptography**
- Importance of using **asymmetric encryption** for strong security.
- **Shared keys** and **vulnerabilities** in symmetric systems leading to potential exploits.

**Conclusion and Call to Action**
- Encouragement to explore more about smart card vulnerabilities and solutions.
- **Authenticate**: A company focusing on integrating secure interactions across various devices.

**Interactive Learning and Further Exploration**
- Opportunity to engage with practical demonstrations at the physical security village.
- Invitation for questions and deeper engagement in securing and understanding access control systems.
