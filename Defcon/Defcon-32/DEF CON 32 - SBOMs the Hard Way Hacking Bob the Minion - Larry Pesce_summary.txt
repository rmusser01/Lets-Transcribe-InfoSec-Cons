**Introduction to SBOMs and Bob the Minion**

- Presentation on generating a **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** for Davolink's Bob the Minion WiFi router
- Focus on hardware disassembly and firmware extraction
- Aim to generate a comprehensive **SBOM** and identify security vulnerabilities

**Background and Importance of SBOMs**

- **SBOM**: Inventory of all software, versions, and origins in a product
- Key for product security and software supply chain management
- Predicted to be mandatory for connected products by 2025

**Regulatory Landscape**

- **Executive Order 14 208**: Requires SBOMs in products for US government and consumer markets
- **FDA 524 B**: Medical devices must include an SBOM
- **Cyber Trustmark Program**: Voluntary consumer protection initiative by FCC
- **EU Cyber Resiliency Act (EU CRA)**: Mandatory SBOM inclusion and vulnerability management for products in Europe

**Benefits of SBOMs**

- Provides a **software inventory** for first and third-party components
- Enables **vulnerability discovery** and risk mitigation
- Encourages the operationalization of SBOMs in security and penetration testing processes

**Challenges with Bob the Minion**

- Davolink's restricted firmware release policy
- No public firmware updates or downloads available
- Necessitated unconventional methods for firmware extraction

**Hardware Hacking Process**

- **Bob the Minion**: A wireless home router with WiFi 6, easy mesh support, and WPA3
- Disassembly and chip analysis to access firmware
- Utilized SPI flash and JTAG/SWD interfaces for firmware extraction

**Firmware Extraction and Findings**

- **Winbond W25N01GV**: 3V 1 gigabit flash chip used in Bob the Minion
- Discovered vulnerabilities, remote code vulnerabilities, and insecure default credentials
- Found scripts communicating with IP addresses in China

**Conclusion and Future Work**

- Importance of SBOMs in improving IoT security
- Ongoing challenges in firmware extraction and analysis
- Presentation aimed to highlight hands-on hardware hacking and SBOM generation challenges
