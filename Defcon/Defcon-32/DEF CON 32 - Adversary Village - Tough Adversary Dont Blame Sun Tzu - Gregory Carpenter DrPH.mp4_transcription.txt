 I am Greg Carpenter, former NSA guy outed on WikiLeaks, so I get to come out here and
7.36s - 13.50s |  do stuff now and meet real people, so it's nice.
13.50s - 17.30s |  I have an interesting, I think it's an interesting talk today, I've studied for the last couple
17.30s - 28.90s |  years now, pulling information from Russian and Chinese curriculum at their military universities.
28.90s - 35.14s |  And we're going to take a look at how that ties to national strategic goals, their philosophy
35.14s - 37.70s |  and their strategy.
37.70s - 42.98s |  So this is, pretty much it's a no Sun Tzu zone, so no quotes from Sun Tzu for anybody
42.98s - 43.98s |  out here today, okay?
43.98s - 48.48s |  I don't want to hear any.
48.48s - 52.76s |  Quick agenda, just so you can see where we're going to go, pretty straightforward, Chinese
52.76s - 57.28s |  history influences how they're working it today and how it links to national goals,
57.28s - 61.16s |  and the same thing with Russia.
61.16s - 67.48s |  One thing that's common in both Chinese and Russian, and I would say American psychological
67.48s - 74.92s |  warfare and information warfare strategies, are basically controlling the language, controlling
74.92s - 77.08s |  the meaning of words.
77.08s - 80.84s |  Russia has a deep rooted history in this, China's come along just in the last hundred
80.84s - 88.64s |  years or so and started to focus on epistemology and ontology, basically the meaning of words
88.64s - 92.02s |  and the meaning of reality.
92.02s - 98.10s |  I think Philip Dick said it best, because it's the basis for all three psychological
98.10s - 100.98s |  warfare programs.
100.98s - 106.54s |  I'm doing some work on Iran right now too, I'd like to have that soon.
106.54s - 111.08s |  Theirs is a little bit different approach, but they use the same concept as put out by
111.08s - 113.42s |  Philip Dick.
113.42s - 117.90s |  So standard disclaimer from NSA, I got to tell you this because this is, if I don't
117.90s - 121.94s |  say this, they told me I get to go to jail, which is fine.
121.94s - 126.06s |  I met a lot of good people there, so that's that.
126.06s - 129.58s |  So let's start talking about Chinese influences real quick.
129.58s - 134.98s |  Now everyone, pretty much everyone's heard of Sun Tzu, which is probably why you're here.
134.98s - 139.70s |  The whole art of war, and that's about as much as we're going to talk about him.
139.70s - 146.42s |  Now even though he is the seminal historical figure in Chinese information warfare, he's
146.42s - 150.50s |  not the only one taught at the universities.
150.50s - 154.58s |  China focuses on these seven military classics.
154.58s - 156.84s |  Of course the first is the art of war.
156.84s - 161.74s |  Has anyone heard of these other books that are in Chinese curriculum at all?
161.74s - 165.34s |  A few, okay great, that's great.
165.34s - 170.34s |  So think of it this way, the art of war is considered or understood to be the oldest
170.34s - 174.96s |  influence in Chinese strategy and philosophy right now.
174.96s - 181.16s |  But these other books, four of them came out during the warring period, back when China
181.16s - 184.88s |  was consolidating into one national entity.
184.88s - 191.32s |  The rest of them came on 1600s or so, but they're all a different twist on strategy.
191.32s - 197.96s |  For example, the three strategies is directly translated into Mao Tse Tung's art of war,
197.96s - 199.52s |  which we'll go through a little bit later.
200.08s - 206.24s |  Of course Mao had to have his own art of war, because he can't be left out, right?
206.24s - 215.28s |  Wu Xi, the fourth one down, basically talked about, as a politician, how do you manipulate
215.28s - 218.48s |  and influence other politicians?
218.48s - 221.28s |  And how do you manipulate and influence the public?
221.28s - 225.18s |  Not only your public, but everybody else.
225.18s - 231.22s |  So each of these connects back to the Chinese strategy of influencing everyone in different
231.22s - 232.22s |  ways.
232.22s - 235.92s |  But wait, there's more.
235.92s - 241.34s |  Anybody hear of Sun Bin, Sun Tzu's relative?
241.34s - 242.92s |  No.
242.92s - 249.62s |  So until 1972, all of Sun Bin's work, that's his picture there in the middle by the way,
249.62s - 253.34s |  all of his work was considered to be Sun Tzu's work.
253.34s - 257.02s |  And Sun Tzu's art of war was this huge piece.
257.02s - 263.06s |  Only until they found the documents from Sun Bin in 1972, when they were excavating one
263.06s - 269.22s |  of the emperor's gravesites, did they realize that they had more than one document.
269.22s - 275.38s |  Now other documents in here, like the Book of Swindles, is not a strategic book.
275.38s - 281.98s |  It's basically, you could use it at the lock picking village, because it's for thievery.
281.98s - 288.10s |  But it's linked back to, conceptually, a philosophy on how to manipulate other people.
288.10s - 294.66s |  So all of these books are extremely interesting and important in Chinese philosophy, because
294.66s - 297.64s |  they're all taught today.
297.64s - 304.14s |  The periods in China that were the most influential and had the biggest impact on how China would
304.14s - 310.66s |  engage the rest of the world was during, number one, the Warring States period, back 500 or
310.66s - 314.98s |  so B.C. to 200 B.C.
314.98s - 320.58s |  Each of the different parts of China were fighting for autonomy and control over the
320.58s - 322.72s |  rest of China.
322.72s - 330.18s |  And there was consolidation in, I think, 220 B.C. or something like that.
330.18s - 336.88s |  That's when the art of war was actually consolidated into a national program.
336.88s - 342.08s |  Not like we'd know a national program today, but it was the emperor's philosophy at the
342.08s - 349.60s |  time to control and manage the population in China as one China.
349.60s - 355.64s |  The century of humiliation was from 1839 to 1949.
355.64s - 358.16s |  And what happened in that period?
358.16s - 363.04s |  Well, you had the Opium Wars, the Boxer Rebellion.
363.04s - 367.32s |  There were numerous treaties that China was forced to sign where they got the raw end
367.32s - 371.08s |  of the deal, specifically from the West.
371.08s - 377.52s |  They considered the West to be extremely manipulative of their national sovereignty and national
377.52s - 378.88s |  goals.
378.88s - 384.08s |  So they take great offense to the West in many ways.
384.08s - 387.86s |  And you'll see that when we get into the curriculum a little bit later.
387.86s - 393.38s |  And then 8-1-29, anybody know that date by chance?
393.38s - 394.38s |  It's on there.
394.38s - 395.38s |  It's on the flag.
395.38s - 397.02s |  It's the People's Liberation Army.
397.02s - 400.54s |  That's the date that it was formed.
400.54s - 411.25s |  And the star and the Chinese characters for 8-1, Gaoyat.
411.25s - 419.17s |  So here's a copy of, over here, here's a copy of the syllabus in the Chinese, in the National
419.17s - 421.97s |  Defense University of the People's Liberation Army.
421.97s - 428.61s |  I pulled this out of their website, their internal website.
428.61s - 436.25s |  And if you look closely, you'll see, and I'll translate it for you, basically.
436.25s - 439.73s |  Item number one is Chinese national defense.
439.73s - 441.97s |  Number two is China's armed forces.
441.97s - 445.93s |  And then to get into the international and how to develop the army.
445.93s - 449.89s |  Number five of topics is Mao Zedong's art of war.
449.89s - 458.89s |  Mao is the first theory taught linking Chinese teaching to Chinese strategic goals.
458.89s - 460.45s |  After that, it's Sun Tzu.
460.45s - 462.05s |  Number six is Sun Tzu.
462.05s - 466.01s |  And it goes into seven is the military revolution.
466.01s - 468.67s |  And then number eight is information warfare.
468.67s - 470.67s |  It's not kinetic warfare.
470.67s - 473.05s |  It's all information warfare.
473.05s - 481.89s |  Because 95% of the Chinese historical background for teaching and understanding information
481.89s - 485.57s |  warfare is about non-kinetic activity.
485.57s - 487.25s |  It's not about kinetic activity.
487.25s - 492.09s |  All those books that I showed you, and if anybody wants the references and have some
492.09s - 500.33s |  other stuff, there'll be a PDF available for anybody to download later on.
500.33s - 504.21s |  But the information warfare aspect of number eight is extremely important because that
504.21s - 507.53s |  includes all of the other authors.
507.53s - 512.09s |  Now some of them are intermingled in number five, which is Mao Zedong's art of war.
512.09s - 516.73s |  Like I talked about the three strategies before, but it's all right here.
516.73s - 522.73s |  Everything from the warring period, from the age of humiliation, everything is right here
522.73s - 528.53s |  in this orientation to the National Defense University.
528.53s - 530.73s |  So immediately first thing up, you come in.
530.73s - 537.32s |  These guys here are the teachers of the class.
537.32s - 546.32s |  In Mao Zedong's art of war, it kind of sums up what Chinese internal philosophy is in
546.32s - 551.12s |  how China fits in the universe.
551.12s - 560.32s |  China compared to the rest of the environment and with the rest of the international community,
560.32s - 564.88s |  how they see themselves and how they plan their strategy.
564.88s - 569.68s |  So for example, if the foe moves in, I scram.
569.68s - 573.72s |  That's a rough translation.
573.72s - 580.56s |  It applies to information warfare in the same manner that it applies to a kinetic activity.
580.56s - 587.28s |  So if you're hunting and you're chasing Chinese guys on the web, for the most part, if you
587.28s - 592.48s |  try to go after them, they'll disappear on you and you won't find them.
592.48s - 596.84s |  Some groups stay around, but for the most part, they'll go away.
596.84s - 603.96s |  We were working a number of years ago with APT1 and a guy named Ugly Gorilla, Wang Dong,
603.96s - 610.16s |  and he literally, any time that we came across him or found him on a computer anywhere, he
610.16s - 613.08s |  was gone like a ghost.
613.08s - 620.48s |  So Chinese philosophy is definitely linked to Mao Zedong's interpretation and understanding
620.48s - 630.96s |  of the historical books, but externally from China out, they study Americans and they study
630.96s - 638.44s |  Russians in the same way that we try to study their techniques, tools, procedures, things
638.44s - 644.34s |  like that.
644.34s - 649.34s |  This website is also from the State Controlled Information Office.
649.34s - 655.14s |  So their plan is to not only teach the people that are going into the military, but the
655.14s - 657.94s |  general population.
657.94s - 662.66s |  So the State Controlled Information Office broadcasts to the rest of the population in
662.66s - 665.90s |  China and there's tons of documents on there.
665.90s - 672.50s |  You can go there and download anything you want about what China is teaching the people
672.50s - 679.30s |  of China and how they should act and interact with foreigners.
679.30s - 687.82s |  An interesting note here, this is the most interesting classes in the PLA National Defense
687.82s - 695.58s |  University and you can see there, the fifth most popular class is the Art of War and that
695.58s - 706.30s |  is Sun Tzu, Sun Bin, and Mao Zedong's philosophy all linked together.
706.30s - 714.82s |  The key thing here is that all of these classes, the top classes, all involve elements of understanding
714.82s - 722.60s |  human behavior, decision making, or systems of organization, I would say.
722.60s - 730.12s |  So to understand from the individual up to the strategic level in any organization is
730.12s - 738.60s |  how China looks at implementing a different information environment for you to operate
738.60s - 739.60s |  in.
739.60s - 745.24s |  So we all know that the information environment is a contested environment.
745.24s - 752.52s |  Chinese philosophy is to let it be contested, let it be confusing, like in a Clausewitz
752.52s - 761.44s |  type of a way, but that gives us exactly what we need to not apply kinetic resources to
761.44s - 763.98s |  achieve our sovereignty.
763.98s - 768.16s |  And Chinese sovereignty is basically regional control.
768.16s - 770.40s |  They're looking to be a regional power.
770.40s - 775.80s |  In 2000, there was a great book that came out on the National Defense University Press
775.80s - 781.52s |  by Michael Pillsbury called China Debates Future Security Environment.
781.52s - 788.84s |  And in there, he lays out how Chinese generals and politicians understood how easy it would
788.84s - 795.16s |  be for North Korea to defeat the United States in a one-on-one war.
795.20s - 800.80s |  And that caused me to think for a minute because the disparity of how we would look at a war
800.80s - 806.20s |  with North Korea and how China looked at it was extremely interesting to me.
806.20s - 812.64s |  And it told a lot about the Chinese understanding of what they believe the information environment
812.64s - 816.00s |  really is.
816.00s - 823.12s |  They see America declining, and by 2032, will be a regional power, the same as Russia, the
823.12s - 824.32s |  same as China.
824.32s - 833.82s |  They see themselves rising, and they see us declining, and this is in a balanced world.
833.82s - 839.68s |  Let's go to Russia for a minute.
839.68s - 848.08s |  Russia had three significant periods of influence into their information warfare strategy and
848.08s - 858.42s |  philosophy, the pre-Kremlin period, Lenin, Marx, their theory on war, and the development
858.42s - 869.06s |  of military theory under recent Soviet leadership in the late 70s, early 80s.
869.06s - 879.02s |  The biggest impact on Russian control of information was the Slavophile and Westernizers fight
879.02s - 883.38s |  that was happening in the 1800s.
883.38s - 889.50s |  Russia was an imperial power, and more than half, I would say, of the population, or at
889.50s - 895.74s |  least the imperial court, believed that Russia could be strong by itself, separate from Western
895.74s - 897.06s |  influence.
897.06s - 904.22s |  The Westernizers were the people in the court who wanted to be able to influence the Russian
904.22s - 915.34s |  philosophy for socioeconomic power structure, politics, from Western democracy.
915.58s - 924.14s |  During this period of time, significant propaganda was actually infused into the Russian population,
924.14s - 932.59s |  which kind of changed how things had operated from the 1600s, 1500s or so.
932.59s - 939.39s |  Russia became a much more censored country, even back then, and it followed through, and
939.39s - 952.64s |  it's still a significant part of the strategy today.
952.64s - 958.72s |  In Russia, you see, to this day, you still see state-controlled media.
958.72s - 965.00s |  State-controlled newspapers were a big thing back during the Slavophile-Westernizer fight
965.00s - 973.32s |  back in the 1800s, and the idea for Pravda came out of that historical aspect of controlling
973.32s - 976.92s |  the information environment.
976.92s - 985.37s |  Fast forward a few years, getting into the Cold War aspect of it, and the Cold War was
985.37s - 988.53s |  – let's start with World War II first, sorry about that.
988.53s - 992.61s |  World War II was a significant event for Russia, right?
992.61s - 999.57s |  It was, I would just say, more Russians died, right?
999.57s - 1006.41s |  The population shift in Russia was huge compared to pretty much any other country in the world,
1006.61s - 1009.73s |  and that really affected politics in Russia.
1009.73s - 1015.21s |  It became a much more closed society and started to close even tighter, which meant that they
1015.21s - 1018.57s |  had more control over their information.
1018.57s - 1023.89s |  Into the Cold War period, the U.S. started to infuse Russia because they saw them as
1023.89s - 1028.29s |  a threat, right, with more propaganda at every aspect they could.
1028.29s - 1034.01s |  I mean, we sent Louis Armstrong over, right, to Europe to tour throughout Europe to teach
1034.01s - 1036.77s |  people that America was better than Russia.
1036.77s - 1040.45s |  We did some very popular and interesting things.
1040.45s - 1046.93s |  Jackson Pollock, famous painter, right, paid through a third party, through the CIA, to
1046.93s - 1055.33s |  go make art, you know, dripping paint on a drop cloth, to show Russia that we were much
1055.33s - 1058.01s |  more advanced in an artistic manner.
1058.01s - 1064.33s |  So the Russians, what they did, was they actually sent people over to be art critics
1064.33s - 1065.33s |  in the States.
1065.33s - 1070.25s |  And there's many cases of this, where they became the people to judge what art was.
1070.25s - 1073.29s |  So we were giving them and saying, this is great art.
1073.29s - 1077.01s |  Then they sent us art critics to counterbalance.
1077.01s - 1082.21s |  And this type of a back and forth control of information happened all the way through
1082.21s - 1083.21s |  the 80s.
1083.21s - 1091.29s |  And it wasn't until the early 90s or so, when there was a change, that the big propaganda
1091.29s - 1098.01s |  that went against each country started to subside a little bit.
1098.01s - 1105.05s |  And Russia focused more internally on, again, going back to the basin population and propagandizing
1105.05s - 1107.51s |  them.
1107.51s - 1113.51s |  So that's the background of the Russian history.
1113.51s - 1120.39s |  Now this is basically a list of all the universities in Russia from the Ministry of Defense's website,
1120.39s - 1128.47s |  their internal website, showing everyone that conducts information warfare and propaganda
1128.47s - 1133.83s |  integrated with offensive cyber actions.
1133.83s - 1137.23s |  So and again, this will be available to anybody you want to go there.
1137.95s - 1140.07s |  You know, you figure out how to get in.
1140.07s - 1144.91s |  The big picture on the right is just big enough so you can see it.
1144.91s - 1151.19s |  But they literally have information warfare and propaganda integrated into everything
1151.19s - 1153.15s |  that they teach.
1153.15s - 1156.11s |  It's not separate.
1156.11s - 1161.85s |  Little different from the Chinese model.
1161.85s - 1169.11s |  So let's talk about how they're similar first.
1169.11s - 1176.15s |  Both Russia and China, and the US, by the way, all focus on psychological operations
1176.15s - 1184.35s |  and influence campaigns at a strategic level and at a tactical level.
1184.35s - 1191.47s |  If information can be infused in a tactical level that will actually affect national policy,
1191.47s - 1192.47s |  it'll happen.
1192.47s - 1199.07s |  Just think of any incident that had, it was a one-off, you would call it, that had strategic
1199.07s - 1200.07s |  influence.
1200.07s - 1205.79s |  A number of years ago, there was a guy who was caned, American, who was caned in Thailand,
1205.79s - 1206.79s |  right?
1206.79s - 1209.71s |  He violated a very simple law, right?
1209.71s - 1215.71s |  How do you think that played in Russian propaganda, in Chinese propaganda against the United States
1215.71s - 1221.95s |  as the unruly, the people that won't follow or respect other laws?
1221.95s - 1228.85s |  It played extremely well to their base.
1228.85s - 1235.17s |  And of course, both are affected by historical injuries that happened to them from the West,
1235.17s - 1239.49s |  like for the last couple of hundred years.
1239.49s - 1241.45s |  Differences.
1241.45s - 1248.13s |  The context in how Russia operates and how China operate are completely, I would say,
1248.13s - 1251.13s |  unique to their culture.
1251.13s - 1255.45s |  China controls vast numbers.
1255.45s - 1262.51s |  And they have a bunch of attackers, they have a bunch of defenders, and they're integrated.
1262.51s - 1267.65s |  And some are really loud, you may have noticed, and some are really stealthy.
1267.65s - 1269.25s |  And you really don't know what you get.
1269.25s - 1273.49s |  And sometimes the Chinese will come in and they'll do OSIN on a website, you know, and
1273.49s - 1276.45s |  they'll leave the language setting to Russian.
1276.45s - 1279.77s |  So you know, on first glance, you're looking at a Russian.
1279.77s - 1280.77s |  No, you're not.
1280.93s - 1284.09s |  You're looking at somebody else, just look at the searches, okay?
1284.09s - 1290.11s |  So China will come in and do a whole bunch of different types of operations.
1290.11s - 1295.85s |  On the other hand, the Russians will come in very strategic, and they try to be really
1295.85s - 1302.37s |  good about how they're operating, because limited resources in Russia only allow them
1302.37s - 1312.61s |  to do onesies, twosies in a very strategic manner, directly linked to national strategies.
1312.61s - 1320.73s |  So in short, these two guys are still directing and managing national strategy and philosophy,
1320.73s - 1325.89s |  but it's only based and only linked to the historical injuries that China and Russia
1325.89s - 1331.33s |  have had incurred on them from the West.
1331.33s - 1338.47s |  And with that, I'll leave it up if anybody has any questions at all.
1338.47s - 1339.47s |  No.
1339.47s - 1342.45s |  Okay, fair enough.
1342.45s - 1345.33s |  So as I promised, no Sun Tzu, okay?
1345.33s - 1347.89s |  We didn't give any theory on Sun Tzu, thank God.
1347.89s - 1350.17s |  But there's a Twitter, the Discord, all that stuff.
1350.17s - 1355.01s |  If you want a copy of the slides, you know, hit me up, and I'll send you a PDF, including
1355.01s - 1358.21s |  all the references.
1358.21s - 1360.77s |  And you can have at it yourself.
1360.77s - 1361.41s |  Thank you very much.
