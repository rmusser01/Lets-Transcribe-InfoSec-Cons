 Good afternoon, everyone.
1.30s - 4.76s |  I am so excited to be here to be presenting Wu-Tang is
4.76s - 7.02s |  for the Children, How State Laws Intended
7.02s - 10.16s |  to Protect Children Raise Unintended Risk
10.16s - 11.56s |  and Consequences.
11.56s - 12.82s |  My name is Anthony Hendricks.
12.82s - 16.02s |  I'm a cybersecurity and data privacy attorney based
16.02s - 17.26s |  in Oklahoma City.
17.26s - 19.90s |  While I am a lawyer, I am not your lawyer,
19.90s - 23.12s |  and this presentation should not be considered legal advice.
23.12s - 27.10s |  Instead, think of this as a conversation between friends.
27.10s - 30.02s |  But if you need legal advice, please, please,
30.02s - 33.70s |  please find a local lawyer that can help you.
33.70s - 36.66s |  I also host a cybersecurity podcast that focuses
36.66s - 39.52s |  on exposing underrepresented groups to the field
39.52s - 41.80s |  of cybersecurity and data privacy.
41.80s - 44.90s |  You can scan the QR code, and it'll take you to the podcast,
44.90s - 46.66s |  or you can find the podcast anywhere
46.66s - 49.42s |  where great podcasts are found.
49.42s - 52.82s |  So let's go back to 1998.
52.82s - 56.08s |  So on February 25th, 1998,
56.08s - 58.58s |  hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan made Grammy history
58.58s - 60.68s |  for all the wrong reasons.
60.68s - 63.42s |  After the Wu-Tang Clan lost Best Rap Album
63.42s - 67.58s |  of the Year category, Wu-Tang Clan member ODB jumped on stage
67.58s - 72.62s |  and said the infamous phrase, Wu-Tang is for the children.
72.62s - 75.48s |  Now, if you're not familiar with the Wu-Tang Clan
75.48s - 79.18s |  and the Wu-Tang Clan's lyrics, I just pulled a quick sampling
79.18s - 81.82s |  that I want to share with the group, if that's okay.
81.82s - 84.28s |  Watch your stepkid and protect your neck.
84.28s - 86.48s |  Cash rules everything around me.
86.48s - 87.62s |  Cream, get your money.
87.62s - 89.28s |  Dollar, dollar bills, y'all.
89.28s - 91.54s |  If you want beef, then bring the ruckus.
91.54s - 96.74s |  Wu-Tang Clan ain't nothing to, well, you get the point.
96.74s - 99.78s |  So Wu-Tang Clan is not for the children.
99.78s - 102.54s |  Despite what ODB says,
102.54s - 104.82s |  their lyrics really aren't things you should be playing
104.82s - 108.32s |  for kids, and it appears that states are taking the same kind
108.32s - 111.34s |  of Wu-Tang Clan approach when it comes to state privacy.
111.34s - 113.94s |  While they have all of these kind of laws that are focused
113.94s - 116.60s |  on protecting children, when you start paying attention
116.60s - 118.30s |  to what these laws are doing,
118.30s - 122.00s |  you realize that they're raising a lot of privacy risk,
122.00s - 124.20s |  and they're not doing what they say they're going to be doing,
124.20s - 126.94s |  which is protecting children.
126.94s - 129.64s |  So what exactly are we going to chat about today?
129.64s - 131.10s |  So we're going to first start talking
131.10s - 134.06s |  about children's privacy and safety laws.
134.06s - 136.80s |  We'll then talk about how states are taking the lead.
136.80s - 138.86s |  We'll then look at some unintended consequences,
139.26s - 140.86s |  and then finally we'll talk about some
140.86s - 143.86s |  of my favorite Wu-Tang Clan songs and talk about ways
143.86s - 145.42s |  that we can grow together.
145.42s - 147.02s |  Does that sound good?
147.02s - 148.76s |  All right, let's go.
148.76s - 151.92s |  So children, privacy, and safety.
151.92s - 155.38s |  So we're going to stay in 1998, and we're going to talk
155.38s - 157.52s |  about Congress passing COPA,
157.52s - 160.72s |  which is the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
160.72s - 163.56s |  And this law protects children under the age
163.56s - 167.72s |  of 18 requiring certain disclosures.
167.72s - 170.24s |  So what led up to the creation of this federal law?
170.24s - 173.42s |  So as people started getting on the internet, people had
173.42s - 175.52s |  so many concerns about how we were going
175.52s - 176.98s |  to protect our children.
176.98s - 179.48s |  And so the Children's Advertising Review Unit,
179.48s - 182.28s |  which is an industry group, drafted some guidelines
182.28s - 184.24s |  on what they thought the industry should be doing
184.24s - 185.84s |  to protect children.
185.84s - 188.84s |  And so when you think about COPA, COPA was a remix.
188.84s - 192.62s |  What they did is they took that industry kind of guidelines,
192.62s - 194.92s |  and they turned it into legislation.
195.04s - 200.42s |  So in 2013, COPA's rules were updated to kind
200.42s - 202.42s |  of broaden the definition of children.
202.42s - 206.42s |  And in 2017, the rules were updated again so that it applied
206.42s - 209.82s |  to IoT devices, the internet of things.
209.82s - 211.42s |  So problem solved.
211.42s - 213.22s |  Why exactly are we here?
213.22s - 215.78s |  Why am I taking up some of your time today?
215.78s - 221.78s |  Well, COPA hasn't really been updated much besides 2013
221.78s - 225.28s |  and 2017, and our current laws weren't created
225.28s - 228.60s |  to address how we actually use the internet right now, right?
228.60s - 231.70s |  And so other countries have passed laws that focus
231.70s - 236.99s |  on children, and our laws look just simply out of date.
236.99s - 239.15s |  One of the issues with our current laws is,
239.15s - 241.55s |  what exactly is a child, right?
241.55s - 243.91s |  If I just asked a person on the street what a child was,
243.91s - 246.79s |  they'd quickly tell me someone under the age of 18.
246.79s - 248.61s |  But in COPA, they define a child
248.61s - 251.49s |  as a person under the age of 13.
251.51s - 254.05s |  So the law doesn't even look after teenagers.
254.05s - 257.29s |  And so that leads to some issues with gaps in the law
257.29s - 259.39s |  because we're not protecting our teenagers
259.39s - 260.85s |  who are often more vulnerable
260.85s - 264.81s |  because they are online all the time.
264.81s - 266.41s |  Also, there's been a lot of talk
266.41s - 269.35s |  about protecting our children, but not much action.
269.35s - 271.75s |  For three years in a row, President Biden in the State
271.75s - 274.95s |  of the Union starts to talk about children's privacy.
274.95s - 278.21s |  And he talks about how we need to strengthen privacy protection,
278.21s - 280.95s |  how we need to stop big tech from collecting personal data
280.95s - 283.35s |  on kids and teenagers online.
283.35s - 286.47s |  And he always has those phrases.
286.47s - 289.27s |  But nothing has really come from it.
289.27s - 290.61s |  And there's been a number of laws
290.61s - 292.15s |  that people have been debating,
292.15s - 294.67s |  including the Kids Online Safety,
294.67s - 298.57s |  the Teens Online Privacy Act, and COPA 2.0.
298.57s - 300.35s |  So there's been a lot of conversations
300.35s - 303.07s |  about protecting our children.
303.07s - 307.27s |  So I was done with my slides, and then the Senate wanted
307.27s - 308.45s |  to start doing stuff.
308.45s - 312.31s |  And so the Senate began debating COSA and COPA,
312.31s - 315.41s |  and they passed both of those laws, right?
315.41s - 318.35s |  They passed it by wide margins, 91 to 3.
318.35s - 321.31s |  So it got a lot of bipartisan support.
321.31s - 323.55s |  So let's talk about those laws.
323.55s - 326.25s |  So COSA would require social media companies
326.25s - 329.21s |  to protect users under age 17.
329.21s - 331.15s |  So it kind of expands that definition
331.15s - 333.41s |  to include more and more people.
333.41s - 335.51s |  It will require companies to provide guardians
335.51s - 339.33s |  with more controls over minors' use on those platforms.
339.33s - 342.77s |  COPA 2.0 would also create stronger online privacy
342.77s - 345.57s |  protections for our teenagers.
345.57s - 347.81s |  So good job, problem solved.
347.81s - 350.21s |  Why exactly are we still here?
350.21s - 353.17s |  Well, it still has to be passed by the House.
353.17s - 355.67s |  And the House is on vacation, and not the types
355.67s - 357.07s |  of vacations that we take.
357.07s - 359.97s |  I'm talking about a six-week vacation.
359.97s - 362.27s |  And so we're not really going to have anything done
362.27s - 365.13s |  by the House in a couple of months.
365.13s - 369.03s |  And so we're still facing these issues.
369.03s - 372.03s |  So let's start talking about how states are taking the lead.
372.03s - 374.23s |  When the federal government fails to act,
374.23s - 376.55s |  our states start acting.
376.55s - 379.25s |  So if you're going to have any conversation about states
379.25s - 381.29s |  and privacy, you have to start with California,
381.29s - 384.89s |  because they're often the leader when it comes to privacy.
384.89s - 389.23s |  In 2022, California passed the age-appropriate design code.
389.23s - 391.95s |  And that law required digital platforms to kind
391.95s - 394.99s |  of determine whether their product was targeting
395.01s - 398.59s |  towards children, and to assess the type of risk of harm
398.81s - 399.75s |  when it comes to children.
401.21s - 403.39s |  And other states have gotten into the mix.
403.39s - 406.19s |  Last year, 35 states, along with Puerto Rico,
406.19s - 408.85s |  started debating proposed laws.
409.15s - 411.05s |  And this year, it still continues.
411.25s - 414.49s |  Twelve state legislatures have pending legislation
414.49s - 416.05s |  where they're talking about this.
416.05s - 419.01s |  And these proposed laws range from bans on social media
419.01s - 423.75s |  for children, to restrictions, to not allowing companies
423.75s - 425.47s |  to have targeted ads towards children.
426.97s - 430.37s |  So what exactly do these laws look like?
430.37s - 432.41s |  So I threw them in a couple of different buckets
432.41s - 434.81s |  so that we can talk about them just all together.
435.21s - 438.17s |  So there are some that include just social media bans.
438.17s - 440.57s |  So Montana says, hey, we're going to ban TikTok.
440.57s - 441.81s |  No TikTok for anyone.
442.31s - 444.27s |  Utah and Arkansas ban minors
444.27s - 446.01s |  from using social media altogether.
446.01s - 448.45s |  If you're under a certain age, you can't get online.
448.87s - 452.51s |  Then there are other states that have just age restrictions.
452.73s - 455.31s |  And so Arkansas has an age restriction law.
455.31s - 458.33s |  Louisiana and Utah, where you're under the age of 13,
458.91s - 461.53s |  you're not able to use these social media companies.
463.53s - 466.81s |  Another category is restrictions on features, where they say,
466.81s - 469.97s |  hey, certain features are not allowed to be used
470.17s - 471.97s |  if the user is a child.
471.97s - 474.53s |  And so usually it's related to targeted ads.
474.87s - 477.93s |  And then there are bans on collecting minors information,
477.93s - 480.33s |  where you can't collect certain information about kids.
482.73s - 483.87s |  So problem solved, right?
484.11s - 485.43s |  We're done.
485.43s - 488.87s |  Well, these state laws are talking about children's privacy
488.87s - 491.73s |  and online safety, so we should be good to go, right?
492.97s - 494.13s |  Not exactly.
494.13s - 495.87s |  And then the lawsuits happened.
495.87s - 497.93s |  Lots and lots of lawsuits.
498.71s - 501.23s |  So federal courts have granted preliminary injunctions
501.23s - 504.11s |  that blocked laws in Arkansas, California and Texas.
504.81s - 508.01s |  And so there are a lot of lawsuits that are saying, hey,
508.01s - 512.33s |  these laws that are intended for children really raise unintended consequences.
512.35s - 514.65s |  They create a lot of problems.
515.35s - 517.13s |  So let's talk about those consequences.
517.13s - 519.49s |  Let's talk about those problems with these laws.
521.54s - 524.30s |  If you are going to create a law that protects children,
524.68s - 526.24s |  you got to know who's a child, right?
526.24s - 528.44s |  You got to know who's a child and who's an adult.
528.78s - 533.04s |  And while the goal is more protection for children, it comes with two big costs.
533.28s - 535.60s |  It comes with the cost related to our privacy
535.80s - 538.90s |  and a cost related to our First Amendment rights.
541.11s - 546.31s |  So these laws require companies provide additional protections for minors,
546.31s - 549.43s |  and so you need to find out who exactly is a kid.
549.43s - 553.33s |  And you do this by requiring age verifications, right?
553.81s - 557.07s |  And so we've probably all kind of seen these things where it's online.
557.27s - 559.97s |  Please verify that you're over the age of 18.
560.61s - 562.77s |  But these state laws are asking for more.
562.77s - 565.87s |  They're usually asking for third party verifications
566.07s - 569.97s |  or even some weird stuff like age estimations.
569.97s - 571.23s |  And so that's that's really weird.
571.23s - 572.59s |  And we'll talk about that for a moment.
574.03s - 578.09s |  So third party verifications, this is when a third party is used
578.09s - 581.57s |  to verify someone's age, so this can be something like, hey, take a picture
581.57s - 586.29s |  of your ID so that we can show that you are over the age of 18 or hey,
586.29s - 588.79s |  use your credit card, put your credit card information in
588.99s - 592.89s |  and we'll know that you are over the age of 18 because you have a credit card.
593.49s - 598.33s |  Other sites require users to sign up for other third party software
598.33s - 600.85s |  where you put in your information for them, you get an account
601.05s - 603.73s |  and then they say, hey, just give us the information from your account
603.85s - 605.85s |  and we can verify how old you are.
607.55s - 610.35s |  Another way in which is a little bit weirder,
610.35s - 612.89s |  companies attempt to guess a user's age.
613.19s - 616.43s |  And so this can be done by turning on your camera
616.73s - 621.69s |  and having facial recognition guess if you are over the age of 18.
621.69s - 624.19s |  That sounds a little creepy, doesn't it?
624.19s - 627.03s |  Others have suggested that a user's age can be guessed
627.05s - 629.73s |  based on their online activities.
629.93s - 633.19s |  So they'll kind of look at what website you're going to determine
633.49s - 637.26s |  if you are an adult.
637.26s - 638.50s |  So what's the problem?
638.50s - 640.26s |  What is the exact problem with this?
640.26s - 644.42s |  Well, it's too much information and too little information.
644.72s - 648.82s |  So people have to give even more information to companies.
649.06s - 651.40s |  You have to give them your ID, your credit card.
651.52s - 654.66s |  You have to give them access to your online activities.
654.96s - 659.62s |  Does anybody feel comfortable with giving more and more information to companies?
660.12s - 663.06s |  But also, there are some people who don't have that information.
663.26s - 667.36s |  If you don't have a credit card, it means that you can't get on social media.
667.62s - 670.58s |  You know, if you don't have an ID, it means that, well,
670.58s - 673.08s |  you can't get on to any of these websites.
673.28s - 676.86s |  And so there's a problem with too much information and too little information.
679.28s - 681.88s |  And then accuracy with this biometrics.
682.12s - 685.84s |  Can these systems accurately identify a person's age? Right.
686.88s - 689.24s |  Even though we've had advancements in these systems,
689.64s - 693.42s |  this software still has trouble with distinguishing faces of women and people
693.42s - 698.12s |  of color. And so I like to call this the black doesn't crack problem. Right.
698.42s - 699.92s |  The software is going to be looking at you
699.92s - 702.18s |  and they're not going to be able to identify your age,
702.18s - 706.18s |  largely because it was trained using white men as the model.
707.38s - 709.88s |  But there's also questions about the ability for companies
709.88s - 712.02s |  to protect your biometric information.
712.22s - 714.84s |  You're giving them more and more information about you.
715.84s - 719.94s |  And so we've seen so many of these headlines about all of these lawsuits
719.94s - 723.96s |  and these lawsuit settlements related to biometric information.
724.20s - 727.70s |  Last month, Metta agreed to pay one point four billion dollars
727.70s - 730.70s |  to settle a biometric lawsuit with the state of Texas.
731.00s - 735.24s |  Instagram reached a settlement in Illinois for sixty eight point five million
735.24s - 739.60s |  dollars. TikTok reached a ninety two million dollar settlement for a biometric
739.60s - 743.90s |  case. And so do we trust these companies with having more and more
744.12s - 747.26s |  of our information, especially our biometric information?
750.39s - 755.17s |  It also raises First Amendment problems and First Amendment laws.
755.53s - 758.23s |  Some of these laws are creating First Amendment concerns from everyone.
758.59s - 762.69s |  And you may be wondering, why is this a First Amendment issue? Right.
763.07s - 768.47s |  So let's take a moment and talk about constitutional law for non attorneys.
768.47s - 772.49s |  Just one slide and you will walk away knowing more constitutional law
772.67s - 775.03s |  than most people in this country. All right.
775.59s - 779.29s |  So the First Amendment protects my speech, right?
779.55s - 781.19s |  It protects your speech.
781.19s - 783.79s |  But the First Amendment also applies to children.
783.79s - 785.89s |  It protects our children's speeches.
786.33s - 789.39s |  Another area is that it protects company speeches.
789.43s - 791.43s |  A lot of people don't understand that.
791.43s - 793.93s |  But the First Amendment applies to companies.
794.93s - 798.55s |  And also, we need to remember that freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom
798.55s - 800.09s |  from consequences.
800.09s - 802.79s |  So you could be online saying crazy things
803.11s - 806.15s |  and you will still face consequences.
806.35s - 810.31s |  It is a freedom of speech from the government creating laws about that.
810.51s - 813.11s |  But not freedom of consequences.
813.11s - 817.09s |  But also, the First Amendment creates protects the creation
817.09s - 821.19s |  and dissemination of information because that's considered speech.
822.65s - 825.45s |  So now you are our constitutional scholars.
827.15s - 829.79s |  All right, so let's talk about the First Amendment again.
830.25s - 832.81s |  Kids and parents have a First Amendment, right?
833.19s - 837.49s |  Right. These laws restrict children's access to social media sites and children,
837.49s - 842.81s |  even ones under the age of 13, have a constitutional right to speech.
843.29s - 845.91s |  Also, their parents have a right to make decisions
846.11s - 849.65s |  about what type of speech their children are being able to give.
849.65s - 853.21s |  And a lot of these laws say, hey, even if your parents are fine
853.21s - 855.49s |  with you getting on these social media sites,
855.49s - 857.71s |  we don't want you because you're under the age of 13
858.27s - 861.97s |  and you can't do that because you're infringing on the children
861.97s - 863.97s |  and the parents' First Amendment rights.
865.53s - 868.01s |  It also has an impact on company rights.
868.01s - 871.43s |  As we talked about, companies have a First Amendment, right?
872.13s - 875.47s |  These laws also prohibit and restrict the collection, sale
875.57s - 877.73s |  and sharing of children's data.
878.01s - 881.71s |  And so when courts looked at this issue, the courts have repeatedly said,
882.07s - 885.71s |  hey, if you're going to create these laws that restrict the rights of companies
886.27s - 890.21s |  to collect this information, then there must be a very important,
890.21s - 892.33s |  compelling government interest.
892.33s - 896.77s |  And it has to be narrowly tailored, like you need to have the least restrictive laws.
897.07s - 899.77s |  And only then are we going to allow you to do something
899.91s - 904.67s |  that may potentially infringe on these First Amendment rights.
906.51s - 908.11s |  So what about adults?
908.11s - 913.27s |  While these laws are focused on children, they also impact the rights of adults.
913.33s - 916.33s |  These laws could have a chilling effect on your speech.
916.57s - 921.17s |  If you have to show your ID or put in your credit card information before logging
921.17s - 925.43s |  on to Twitter, that's probably going to change what you're going to say online, right?
925.77s - 927.89s |  Because everybody knows exactly who you are.
928.43s - 932.47s |  And so it has an impact on what people may say.
936.84s - 940.64s |  Another common element in all of these state laws is content moderation.
941.10s - 944.10s |  The focus is keeping harmful information away from children.
944.66s - 948.20s |  However, this encourages companies to censor all information.
948.20s - 951.40s |  It encourages them to delete posts meant for adults
951.70s - 954.36s |  because they may not be appropriate for children.
954.86s - 959.92s |  And companies' content moderation is very different from government-required restrictions.
960.20s - 964.60s |  But it encourages more content moderation by companies.
966.16s - 970.42s |  So now let's talk about ways that we can address these issues.
970.66s - 973.82s |  Maybe not through the use of state laws, but through other mechanisms,
973.84s - 977.52s |  by looking at some of my favorite Wu-Tang Clan songs and skits.
977.82s - 978.62s |  Sounds good?
978.88s - 979.54s |  All right.
980.98s - 982.88s |  Could it all be so simple?
982.94s - 989.04s |  One of the closing tracks of Enter the 36th Chamber, where the Wu-Tang Clan members talk
989.04s - 991.68s |  about the simpler things in life.
992.24s - 993.98s |  So it's not all doom and gloom.
994.28s - 998.98s |  There are still ways that we can protect children and respect our rights.
999.84s - 1003.08s |  So we should think about simpler solutions.
1003.50s - 1005.44s |  So what's the problem that we want to solve?
1005.44s - 1007.88s |  What exactly is the problem that we want to address?
1008.28s - 1011.44s |  And solve that problem in the least restrictive way.
1014.23s - 1016.59s |  Next, we need to stop being sharks.
1016.83s - 1021.29s |  One of the skits from a Wu-Tang Clan album was talking about people who are sharks.
1021.59s - 1023.19s |  Sharks are people who are biters.
1023.19s - 1023.97s |  They're copiers.
1024.59s - 1026.93s |  Most people try to steal the Wu-Tang Clan style.
1027.23s - 1031.29s |  In the U.S., states are trying to steal what they're doing in Europe.
1031.69s - 1034.67s |  And a lot of these state laws are just copycats.
1034.93s - 1036.57s |  Of laws in the EU.
1037.13s - 1038.87s |  And that's a problem.
1039.07s - 1041.93s |  Because this is America, and we do freedom differently.
1042.23s - 1048.63s |  Our First Amendment protections are very different than protections found in other countries.
1048.63s - 1053.03s |  And so that means when you're taking a law from another country and trying to apply it here,
1053.23s - 1055.63s |  it raises all types of issues.
1055.89s - 1058.63s |  So instead of trying to steal or bite from other people,
1058.89s - 1062.47s |  we need to create American-focused solutions.
1062.59s - 1065.27s |  We shouldn't just look to see what other countries are doing.
1065.63s - 1069.99s |  We should focus on what our rights are, what our beliefs and our traditions are,
1069.99s - 1072.83s |  to create specific U.S. laws.
1074.93s - 1077.33s |  Cash rules everything around me, right?
1077.63s - 1082.67s |  We need to talk about the importance of money, the importance of involvement with industry.
1083.03s - 1085.99s |  We can't exclude industry when we attempt to create these laws.
1085.99s - 1090.93s |  I think it's important for us to remember that COPA was an industry standard.
1091.03s - 1094.53s |  Like we took something from the industry as guidelines and we used
1094.53s - 1096.63s |  that as a starting point to create a law.
1097.13s - 1102.63s |  A number of these restrictions that states are coming up with, they are expensive to implement.
1102.73s - 1105.19s |  Not only for companies, but for the government.
1105.19s - 1109.93s |  For the government to be able to monitor whether people are following these things.
1109.93s - 1115.83s |  And so we need to focus on better industry standards and allowing them to be part
1115.83s - 1118.59s |  of the process so that we can have better solutions.
1121.70s - 1124.10s |  Next, we need to proceed with caution.
1124.50s - 1126.22s |  The law is constantly changing.
1126.22s - 1128.46s |  And our courts continue to look at these issues.
1128.66s - 1133.52s |  And so what might be fine a couple of months ago isn't fine now.
1133.52s - 1136.50s |  So remember, yesterday's price is not today's price.
1136.70s - 1141.82s |  Things that might be okay when we looked in the past aren't exactly going to be fine now
1141.82s - 1146.02s |  because the law is constantly changing and developing in this area.
1146.02s - 1150.26s |  And then finally, a better tomorrow.
1150.86s - 1153.66s |  We need to focus on data minimization, right?
1153.66s - 1159.22s |  We need to focus on ways to have the least amount of information given to companies.
1159.68s - 1163.56s |  We can protect children by placing an emphasis on funding law enforcement
1163.78s - 1166.28s |  and groups that tackle child exploitation.
1166.82s - 1171.16s |  We need to educate kids on how to be safer online, right?
1171.46s - 1175.48s |  Not only just having laws that place additional protections for children,
1175.48s - 1178.06s |  we also need to tell children that they need to protect themselves.
1178.06s - 1180.86s |  They need to watch their step and protect their neck, right?
1181.42s - 1185.92s |  And then finally, we need to have comprehensive privacy protections for everyone.
1185.92s - 1191.16s |  We need to create laws that protect all of us, not just our children, but every single American.
1191.66s - 1194.82s |  So what did we learn today?
1195.32s - 1200.36s |  People forget about half of all new information within an hour of learning it.
1200.42s - 1203.72s |  So it's not uncommon for someone to say, okay, you stayed an extra day
1203.72s - 1207.42s |  at DEF CON for that last day, what exactly did you learn?
1207.42s - 1210.22s |  And I saw that there was someone talking about children's privacy.
1210.52s - 1211.38s |  What did you learn?
1211.38s - 1215.58s |  And it's not uncommon for you to be like, ugh, I can't recall,
1215.58s - 1218.52s |  but he did a great job and I loved his suit, right?
1219.72s - 1224.52s |  And it's not your fault, because a human brain can only focus on six
1224.52s - 1229.88s |  to nine new pieces of information before there is a steep drop off.
1230.18s - 1232.78s |  So I am going to help everyone out.
1233.08s - 1234.88s |  Here are six takeaways.
1234.88s - 1238.98s |  So if someone asks you, what exactly did you learn from this presentation?
1239.24s - 1242.88s |  You will be able to remember at least one thing, right?
1243.38s - 1249.18s |  So first, the public is right to be concerned with the privacy and safety of our children.
1249.78s - 1254.04s |  Two, the federal government has been able to update and pass new,
1254.28s - 1257.18s |  the federal government has not been able to update and pass new laws,
1257.48s - 1259.18s |  so states are taking the lead.
1259.64s - 1264.99s |  Three, state laws will be all right.
1265.39s - 1270.63s |  State laws have unintended consequences that impact our privacy and rights.
1270.95s - 1275.35s |  Four, state children privacy laws ask us to trade our rights
1275.35s - 1278.85s |  for potential protections, but it's not a fair trade.
1279.73s - 1282.95s |  Laws should be narrowly focused based on U.S. standards
1282.95s - 1285.85s |  and laws and include industry input.
1286.29s - 1291.03s |  And then six, Wu-Tang is not for the children, but their songs still slap.
1291.69s - 1292.39s |  All right.
1292.79s - 1294.05s |  So thank you so much.
1294.05s - 1298.29s |  If you like the slides and you want to get a copy, you can scan a QR code.
1298.29s - 1302.09s |  It'll take you to my website and then you can download the slides.
1302.09s - 1307.65s |  They won't be available until probably tomorrow because hotel Wi-Fi is not the best.
1309.01s - 1309.41s |  All right.
1309.41s - 1310.55s |  Well, thank you so much.
1310.55s - 1314.61s |  I really appreciate this time to talk about children's privacy.
