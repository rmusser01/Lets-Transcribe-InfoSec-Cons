**Introduction**
- Speaker: Michael Aguilar
- Topic: Dysfunctional Unity in **medical device security**

**Speaker Background**
- **Principal consultant** for SecureWorks Adversary Group
- Specializes in **offensive security**, including **physical security**, **social engineering**, and **adversary simulations**
- Interests include reading, **offensive coding**, cycling, and loud music

**Dysfunctional Unity in Medical Devices**
- Focus on **dysfunction** among security researchers, manufacturers, and governing bodies like the **FDA**
- **Dysfunction**: Abnormal or unhealthy interpersonal behavior and interaction
- Challenges with **interconnected medical devices** and their security vulnerabilities

**Security Challenges**
- **Vulnerabilities** in medical infrastructure
- Issues with **FDA guidelines**, which are often recommendations rather than strict rules
- Problems with manufacturers being their own CNAs, potentially stalling **CVE releases**

**Reporting and Telemetry**
- **FDA** processes may not fully understand the severity of vulnerabilities
- Reports with critical flaws sometimes result in products still being accepted by the **FDA**

**Exploits and Network Security**
- Medical devices often have **legacy systems** with network connectivity, posing security risks
- Potential for **network infiltration** through seemingly secure devices
- **Active Directory** and other networking protocols can be exploited from these devices

**Physical Security Assessments**
- Hospital secure areas can be accessed with minimal security breaches
- **Physical security** often underestimated in medical environments

**Adversarial Testing**
- Importance of thorough **adversarial testing** over basic scanning
- Need for **comprehensive testing** to prevent future vulnerabilities and costly recalls

**Collaboration and Improvement**
- Encouragement for manufacturers to collaborate with researchers
- Suggestion for **FDA** and **CISA** to hire knowledgeable security professionals
- **Medical device manufacturers** urged to make informed decisions regarding device security

**DICOM and Security Research**
- Example of vulnerability in **DICOM files** allowing malware execution
- Highlighting the need for actionable security research

**Future Outlook**
- Emphasis on cohesive collaboration between all parties involved
- Recognition of medical devices as critical infrastructure needing heightened security focus

**Conclusion**
- Advocacy for better communication and understanding between researchers and manufacturers
- Open invitation for further discussion and collaboration in the **biohacking village**.
