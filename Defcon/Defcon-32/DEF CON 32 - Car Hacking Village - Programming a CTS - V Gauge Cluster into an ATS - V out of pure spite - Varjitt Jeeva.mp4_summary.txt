**Introduction to Car Hacking**

- Introduction by Varjitt Jeeva at DEF CON 32 Car Hacking Village
- Personal background: Software engineer with interest in cars
- Initial reluctance to purchase a Cadillac ATS-V due to **gauge cluster** design

**Gauge Cluster Issues**

- Original car came with **needle gauge cluster** 
- Other GM models featured **digital gauge clusters**
- Programming services available to retrofit digital clusters

**Retrofit Process**

- Initial investigation into programming services
- Found multiple online resources and forums
- Personal decision to self-program without incurring high costs

**Technical Details of Retrofit**

- **12.3 inch digital gauge cluster** used from Cadillac models
- Compatibility with original carâ€™s plug connector
- Similar engine and configuration between CTS-V Sport and ATS-V

**Programming Steps**

- **CAN bus module programming**: Configure authentication, load firmware, and set configuration flags
- **Authentication**: Program VIN and security pin onto the cluster
- **Firmware**: Use GM's SPS2 software to load necessary files

**Self-Programming Techniques**

- Use of **CH341A EEPROM programmer** to modify EEPROM chip
- Discovery of VIN and security pin in plain text
- Authentication success indicated by correct mileage display

**Configuration and Setup**

- Use of GM SPS2 software for setting up cluster configuration
- Harnessing local file dumps to adjust RPO codes and configuration flags
- Modify XML files to enable desired gauge cluster view

**Cost-Saving Measures**

- Avoiding costly emulator tools and services
- DIY approach saved approximately $950
- Sharing methods on GitHub and forums for community benefit

**Conclusion and Future of GM Programming**

- Encouragement for open source and community-driven modifications
- Appreciation for DEF CON and Car Hacking Village platform
- Personal reflection on the learning experience and community impact
