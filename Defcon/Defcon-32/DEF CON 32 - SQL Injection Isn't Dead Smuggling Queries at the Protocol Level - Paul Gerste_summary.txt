**Overview of SQL Injection Smuggling**

- **SQL Injection Smuggling**: Explores deeper levels beyond query syntax to attack database wire protocols.
- **Objective**: Demonstrates how attackers can inject entire (No)SQL statements into an application's database connection.

**Methodology**

- **Request Smuggling for Binary Protocols**: Applies the concept of HTTP request smuggling to binary protocols.
- **Desynchronization Techniques**: Corrupts message boundaries to desynchronize applications and databases, leading to vulnerabilities.

**Research Insights**

- **Protocols Examined**: Focus on Postgres and MongoDB.
- **Message Structures**: Analysis of message structures for potential injection points.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Identification of message length and integer truncation issues in client libraries.

**Exploitation Techniques**

- **Payload Crafting**: Techniques to exploit message length fields and inject malicious SQL statements.
- **Impact**: Potential to perform authentication bypass, data leakage, and remote code execution.

**Real-World Applicability**

- **Vulnerable Libraries**: Identification of vulnerable libraries across different programming languages.
- **Exploitable Applications**: Examination of real-world applications with default configurations vulnerable to attacks.
- **Framework and Language Limitations**: Discussion on how frameworks and language-specific features affect exploitability.

**Mitigation and Future Research**

- **Mitigation Strategies**: Importance of secure coding practices and proper configuration to prevent vulnerabilities.
- **Future Research Areas**: Exploration of other protocols and bypass techniques to uncover more vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion**

- **Relevance of SQL Injection**: Emphasizes that SQL injection remains a significant threat in modern applications.
- **Developer Guidance**: Encourages the use of parameterized queries, query builders, and ORMs to enhance security.
