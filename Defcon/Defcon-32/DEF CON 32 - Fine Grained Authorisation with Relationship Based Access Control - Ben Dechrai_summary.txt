**Introduction to Access Control**

- Access control is challenging for both humans and animals.
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: A starting point but difficult to scale.
- **Attribute-based access control (ABAC)**: Scales better but struggles with complex conditions.
- **Relationship-based access control (ReBAC)**: Offers nuanced resource access without embedding logic in applications.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- Simplest access control mechanism.
- Based on assigning roles like admin, manager, employee, and guest.
- Example: Only admin, manager, and employee dogs can access the bone.

**Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**

- Adds layers to RBAC by using multiple attributes.
- Attributes can include service dog status, loyalty, and fierceness.
- Example: Access can be time-based or depend on attributes like loyalty.

**Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC)**

- Focuses on entities and relationships rather than users.
- Example: Liam the dog can access a bone through a chain of relationships.
- Relationship changes can affect access without altering the entities themselves.

**Data Storage Models**

- **Entity Attribute Value (EAV) model**: Used for flexible data storage without changing database schema.
- Allows for dynamic entity creation and varied data views.

**ReBAC Data Management**

- Similar to EAV with entities and relationships.
- Relationships define how entities interact.
- Example: Robin owns an article, and members of an organization can view it.

**Permissions and Access Checks**

- Permissions are assigned to relationships.
- Example: Robin can read and write an article; organization members can read it.

**Implementation and Business Logic**

- Relationship-based access management tools can simplify business logic.
- Separates permissions from business logic, making systems more maintainable.

**Demo and Practical Application**

- Demo challenges in implementing ReBAC using tools like Permify.
- Importance of choosing the right level of access control complexity for specific needs. 

**Conclusion and Contact Information**

- ReBAC is powerful but complex; it isn't always the best solution.
- Consider the right access control model for your system's requirements.
