0.00s - 6.08s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Sorry, these lights are kind of bright and I have an aversion to light, but thank you
6.08s - 7.08s |  for coming to the talk.
7.08s - 9.68s |  Again, my name is Michael Aguilar.
9.68s - 10.68s |  I'm a...
10.68s - 11.68s |  Oh, perfect.
11.68s - 12.68s |  Thank you so much.
12.68s - 13.68s |  Oh, God.
13.68s - 14.68s |  Now I can see.
14.68s - 15.68s |  Hi, everybody.
15.68s - 16.68s |  Thank you for coming.
16.68s - 17.68s |  Again, my name is Michael Aguilar.
17.68s - 26.80s |  Basically, I'm going to give a talk about dysfunctional unity, and I'll kind of touch
26.80s - 33.12s |  on what that is and kind of what I'm talking about.
33.12s - 39.06s |  So me, myself, I am a principal consultant for SecureWorks Adversary Group.
39.06s - 43.00s |  My specialties range in a lot of different practices for offensive security.
43.00s - 48.68s |  Again, things like physical security, breaking into buildings, social engineering, basically
48.68s - 57.36s |  lying my rear end off to get in that building, adversary simulations, binary exploitations,
57.36s - 62.60s |  web exploitations, and also making medical devices play Doom.
62.60s - 68.12s |  That's kind of my fun thing to do for medical devices, I guess, when you kind of get an
68.12s - 71.12s |  area of privilege.
71.12s - 74.76s |  Free time activities, I do like to read a lot.
74.84s - 79.76s |  Basically, if my head is not in a book, it's in another book.
79.76s - 82.04s |  I like to practice my offensive coding skills.
82.04s - 85.88s |  Again, things like A-B bypasses, Am-Z bypasses, things that you'll actually be using in the
85.88s - 88.24s |  field that I use pretty much all the time.
88.24s - 95.40s |  I like to, again, read constantly, but again, free time to build off stress, a lot of cycling,
95.40s - 100.08s |  running, swimming, just basically kind of gets a heart beating because I like to break
100.08s - 104.28s |  into buildings, so I figure that the better I take care of myself, the more I can keep
104.28s - 106.00s |  doing this as a profession.
106.00s - 115.48s |  I also like to get tattoos, it puts me to sleep, and I am a fan of very fast, loud music.
115.48s - 124.28s |  So going over, let me take my glasses off, it's actually a first for me, what is dysfunction
124.28s - 127.60s |  that I'm talking about and how it applies to what I'm speaking about with regards to
127.60s - 132.88s |  the medical device typography and vendors and, I should say, medical device manufacturers
132.88s - 135.64s |  and the FDA and the governing people of that.
135.64s - 140.04s |  I'm also going to talk about a few wars that have basically been won through attrition
140.04s - 145.28s |  when trying to release CVEs, and also some of the lurking dangers of interconnected medical
145.28s - 150.00s |  devices, some of the things that we kind of need to be looking at in the future, and my
150.00s - 154.08s |  theories on a brighter future of how we can actually start doing more things to actually
154.08s - 163.31s |  be secure with regards to deploying these items in secured infrastructure.
163.35s - 167.79s |  So when you think about dysfunction, I put this here because obviously if you're thinking
167.79s - 171.83s |  about dysfunction, this is one of the most dysfunctional families that we've seen in
171.83s - 173.55s |  America.
173.55s - 178.07s |  I'm not going to lie, the family that I'm talking about seems to be one of the most
178.07s - 185.83s |  dysfunctional families in America, and this is again between the tester, the MDM, and
185.83s - 192.82s |  the federal government in the way that they manage these things.
192.82s - 199.86s |  So according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, again, what is dysfunction?
199.86s - 206.82s |  It can be described as an abnormal or unhealthy interpersonal behavior and interaction, again,
206.82s - 207.82s |  with a group.
207.82s - 212.42s |  So again, the groups that I'm talking about are security researchers, the manufacturers
212.42s - 216.70s |  that make these devices, and the rule makers who actually enforce the rules that are supposed
216.70s - 222.90s |  to be applied to these devices as they're ingested into our internal infrastructure.
222.90s - 233.43s |  Now basically these groups are all separated entities that should normally be able to work
233.43s - 237.31s |  cordially together in a standard format.
237.31s - 243.59s |  Occasionally though, the conversations between researcher and like say the person you're
243.59s - 250.35s |  trying to work with to release a vulnerability, the manufacturer, it turns a little bit different.
250.35s - 256.15s |  Again, they have a different idea, an ideology of how things should work in their topography
256.15s - 260.71s |  versus the actual researcher and the nuts and bolts person who actually does the exploitation
260.71s - 262.71s |  on these devices.
262.71s - 267.99s |  Again, us as researchers, when we do these things, we're using techniques and skills
268.07s - 275.07s |  that we've done again and again with proven track records to show the range of the exploit
275.07s - 277.87s |  that we're actually deploying on this.
277.87s - 282.79s |  But the issue that I'm running into is that the guidelines that are being set forth by
282.79s - 287.63s |  federal governments, the FDA, are namely just recommendations.
287.63s - 288.95s |  They're not really hard rules.
288.95s - 292.35s |  The hard rule is that if you have a device with vulnerabilities, they won't sell it in
292.35s - 293.91s |  the domestic market.
293.91s - 297.35s |  But in order to get there, they give you guidelines.
297.35s - 302.43s |  You should do this, not you need to do this or we'll cut you out.
302.43s - 304.27s |  It's you should.
304.27s - 307.43s |  A lot of people use this to their advantage because again, they're not making the smart
307.43s - 313.67s |  choices that they need to make in these devices to deploy them into a critical infrastructure.
313.67s - 320.79s |  Now the other issue is what happens when there is an impasse between a researcher and the
320.79s - 325.95s |  MDM that you're trying to release the CBE with?
325.95s - 328.47s |  Who plays that neutral third party?
328.47s - 335.63s |  A lot of times the MDMs themselves will actually be their own CNAs, which makes it so that
335.63s - 338.43s |  they actually release their own CBEs.
338.43s - 342.27s |  Now the problem is that when you're arguing something between somebody who actually does
342.27s - 347.91s |  it and like the person who's making it, they can just keep stalling and stalling and stalling
347.91s - 353.39s |  and then eventually you'll just give up because you don't want to have to wait like six months,
353.39s - 358.39s |  a year, two years, three years to put out a CBE.
358.39s - 361.83s |  And honestly to tell you the truth, I don't even care about the CBE, I'm just trying to
361.83s - 366.95s |  get this stuff fixed in the product because obviously I saw it, I experienced it, I exploited
366.95s - 370.31s |  it and if I can do it, then somebody else can.
370.31s - 374.39s |  And it's not me who I'm worried about, it's other people who are going to be attacking
374.39s - 379.07s |  our infrastructure that is my main concern.
379.07s - 384.67s |  Now again, my feeling is that again, reporting telemetry that I have turned in, again regarding
384.67s - 388.87s |  findings and stuff that is being ingested by the FDA is not fully, fully understood
388.87s - 391.03s |  to the full of its capacity.
391.03s - 396.15s |  A lot of times you're turning in a report with some somewhat critical and questionable
396.15s - 401.39s |  flaws, but the project will still be accepted and acknowledged by the FDA and then later
401.39s - 403.19s |  sold in the domestic market.
403.19s - 407.83s |  What happens to be able to get to that point, I have no idea because again, I don't work
407.83s - 412.31s |  for a manufacturer, I'm just a consultant that does the test, but the main issue that
412.31s - 416.67s |  I have is again, these major vulnerabilities and these classes of vulnerabilities can potentially
416.67s - 420.67s |  kill somebody or the entire hospital are getting passed through.
420.67s - 427.03s |  And I have no idea how this is getting from A, me, B, report, to C, you're accepted to
427.03s - 429.03s |  your 510K.
429.03s - 432.27s |  This does not make any sense to me.
432.27s - 437.71s |  So again, when they read about a threat, what they're looking at is basically, it's
437.71s - 441.31s |  just a single device in a box.
441.31s - 446.75s |  They're not looking how this item is interconnected or using the connections that they have actually
446.75s - 448.23s |  installed on this.
448.23s - 454.11s |  You'll notice a lot of medical devices are almost legacy devices with NESP32 or some
454.11s - 461.10s |  other device to allow a networking stack to be able to transmit this data back and forth.
461.10s - 463.34s |  I mean, we're talking about a single device, right?
463.34s - 467.78s |  Just one device, what's going to happen?
467.78s - 471.36s |  And that's the main thing, is that when the companies look at these exploits, these things
471.36s - 476.18s |  that I turn in, it's like, oh, it just happened on a device, what's going to happen?
476.18s - 481.90s |  Again, one is that these systems again, are interconnected, meaning that they are connected
481.90s - 482.90s |  to a hospital.
482.90s - 489.18s |  Now, a lot of times again, to get access to that, that means that basically you just plug
489.18s - 490.18s |  something in.
490.22s - 492.82s |  There's just like network ports everywhere in hospitals and a lot of times they're just
492.82s - 493.82s |  not dead.
493.82s - 500.02s |  So, again, they say that it may only affect one device, but again, this one device is
500.02s - 505.54s |  connected to a multiple item or multiple plethora of network nodes through Active Directory
505.54s - 507.34s |  and other means.
507.34s - 514.14s |  And many times again, also the manufacturers say that you're not supposed to plug in device.
514.14s - 518.66s |  The device has an Ethernet port, but it does not need to be plugged in.
518.78s - 522.42s |  But again, if the Ethernet port does not need to be plugged in, then why does it exist in
522.42s - 524.42s |  the device topography?
524.42s - 529.86s |  Also, again, you have to understand where these items are plugged into.
529.86s - 532.98s |  They'll plug into probably a hospital network.
532.98s - 534.98s |  Now a hospital network contains what?
534.98s - 535.98s |  Active Directory.
535.98s - 541.02s |  So, that's kind of the problem, is that now you have a device with a vulnerability that
541.02s - 545.82s |  is connected to an Active Directory network that is able to either utilize NTLM credentials
545.82s - 549.78s |  that you may be able to take and exploit and steal, then point upwards, do things like
549.78s - 553.86s |  ADCS flaws and other kinds of Kerberos-ing stuff to get privilege escalation, basically
553.86s - 557.42s |  to take over the entire domain from that one device.
557.42s - 563.38s |  Again, these kinds of devices are also prime candidates to jump off from in the network.
563.38s - 567.10s |  Even if it's not AD joined, it still gives you the same kind of access to be able to
567.10s - 570.38s |  start doing other attacks to be able to get those kinds of credentials from within the
570.38s - 573.98s |  network, password sprays and other kinds of things, looking for open shares, checking
573.98s - 578.14s |  for simple passwords, checking for anything that basically will give you stuff.
578.14s - 583.30s |  I've gotten a lot of actual credentials by just utilizing network sniffing and pcreds
583.30s - 588.94s |  and other kinds, or credmaster, I'm sorry, credslayer, to basically analyze PCAP files
588.94s - 594.30s |  and pull off the NTLM credentials from PCAP files, just from listening passively, from
594.30s - 600.00s |  the guise of a medical device.
600.00s - 607.52s |  The second thing that I don't get, again, is when I turn in a report with a critical
607.52s - 612.16s |  flaw, but it's still accepted by the FDA.
612.16s - 616.40s |  These are things that basically will either kill a patient, take over the entire hospital,
616.40s - 617.84s |  or blow up the hospital.
617.84s - 623.20s |  In one instance, basically I turned something that was supposed to clean items into a makeshift
623.20s - 629.24s |  bomb because of the access for field service engineering, a heat bay that you now can modify
629.24s - 635.00s |  the control temperatures for, and the usage of pure oxygen and pure alcohol in the thing
635.00s - 641.14s |  to do the sanitization.
641.14s - 647.06s |  Now this leads to how I expect things to go in the future, which is I hope that the FDA
647.06s - 654.14s |  and CISA is looking towards offering more and more support by hiring people that actually
654.14s - 657.06s |  understand what's going on.
657.06s - 661.02s |  That's kind of like nine-tenths of the problem, is that the people who are reading this don't
661.02s - 666.14s |  understand that NTLM theft is bad, or that you can actually get domain admin from a lower
666.14s - 667.64s |  privileged user.
667.64s - 670.74s |  It's just like they look at it and they're like, okay, there's a flaw, and you quote
670.74s - 675.82s |  unquote remediated it, or you have a justification to say that you should be passing credentials
675.82s - 678.90s |  in clear text or whatever the hell happens that gets them these passes.
678.90s - 682.58s |  What happens, I don't know, because again, I am disconnected from this process, but if
682.58s - 686.66s |  anybody has insight into how that happens, please, I'll be right there.
686.66s - 694.20s |  Just let me know what's going on.
694.24s - 702.16s |  Now a lot of times also, medical device manufacturers will say, this is in a protected area.
702.16s - 706.80s |  So again, as I mentioned, I also lead the physical security assessments for my firm.
706.80s - 711.60s |  So in 2022, basically my entire summer was breaking into protected areas.
711.60s - 718.04s |  So the fact that it's in a protected quote unquote area doesn't really mean anything.
718.04s - 719.88s |  Everybody's been to a hospital, right?
719.88s - 727.56s |  They have the double doors, you walk in, it senses you, the IR reader opens the doors.
727.56s - 732.08s |  Do you think you'd really be able to get in just wearing some scrubs, a badge you cloned,
732.08s - 734.64s |  and looking like a general doctor?
734.64s - 735.76s |  It's pretty easy.
735.76s - 740.16s |  All you have to do is keep your head down, just nod to people, act like you work there,
740.16s - 746.24s |  and then they will pretty much believe that you do that if you fit in with a certain profile.
746.24s - 751.52s |  So again, utilizing all of that theory, having these devices in these quote unquote protected
751.52s - 756.88s |  areas really doesn't mean much if you can actually get access to these protected areas.
756.88s - 762.40s |  Now again, the issue is that obviously you need to get into these, but to think that
762.40s - 766.60s |  somebody wouldn't do this if they really needed to affect the topography of a certain area
766.60s - 770.57s |  is a fool's game.
770.57s - 777.67s |  And then one time, I was challenged by an MDM to basically get into the device with
777.67s - 783.69s |  under two minutes to try to get the exploit going because they said that, oh, we have
783.69s - 786.41s |  a case, everything's fine.
786.41s - 787.41s |  Cases don't matter.
787.41s - 791.81s |  Again, if you have a case, that's fine, but basically you need an alarm on it to sound
791.81s - 796.89s |  if you want to make that protected, and that's as per the FDA.
796.89s - 802.29s |  So my record for actually opening and exploiting a device in a case was less than two minutes.
802.29s - 807.33s |  So basically, you open the case, I had a bunch of screws flying everywhere, did the exploit,
807.33s - 812.77s |  got the shell, closed it back up, and then we're all good in under two minutes.
812.77s - 816.13s |  So I only needed two minutes on door to be able to get that exploit out the door and
816.13s - 819.93s |  then get code execution, and then now I'm system on the thing that's going to be cutting
819.93s - 825.62s |  people up.
825.62s - 832.38s |  So again, another layer of the dysfunctional reality of what we have going on with medical
832.38s - 839.78s |  and MDM and researchers is that, again, placing these connected devices onto the hospital
839.78s - 843.54s |  network also increases some level of risk.
843.54s - 847.66s |  If it's not meant to be connected onto the network, then again, I still don't know why
847.66s - 850.58s |  they put networking on these.
850.58s - 854.58s |  Most of the time, what I hear is that the developers for the boards are just utilizing
854.58s - 857.94s |  what's there, and sometimes that has Wi-Fi.
857.94s - 861.82s |  They just don't know how to disable it, or they will just leave the chip on there.
861.82s - 865.34s |  And that's the kind of aspect that I hope to see in the future change in that, again,
865.34s - 868.70s |  if it's not needed and if it's not supposed to be plugged in, then don't keep the stuff
868.70s - 869.70s |  in there.
869.70s - 873.66s |  I mean, hell, just put some freaking glue in the port and then make sure that it won't
873.66s - 874.66s |  go in.
874.66s - 875.66s |  It's really pretty simple.
875.66s - 880.34s |  A soldering iron can do this, but again, this is the part I don't get where they put in
880.34s - 888.66s |  big words in their FAQ, don't plug this in on the network, but here's a network jack.
888.66s - 893.34s |  Also hospitals themselves are dealing with a ton of issues right now.
893.34s - 898.74s |  Again, you've always seen a lot of ransomware going off in hospitals, and why do you think
898.74s - 900.74s |  that is?
900.74s - 906.06s |  And I've been on a lot of adversarial simulations as well, and again, the security of these
906.06s - 907.70s |  places is very down level.
908.02s - 913.14s |  Now, my reason or my theory for this is because, again, the legacy devices, the medical devices
913.14s - 917.46s |  that exist in this topography don't have the strongest security settings.
917.46s - 920.74s |  Other times, they can accept the strongest security settings.
920.74s - 922.14s |  It's an impossibility.
922.14s - 925.62s |  Some of these devices can't even have a password over eight characters because we'll break
925.62s - 926.62s |  something.
926.62s - 930.30s |  So that's why the level of security sometimes drops within these infrastructures because
930.30s - 934.84s |  of their inclusion of these kinds of devices and the allowance for them to be able to run.
934.84s - 938.48s |  So then we have scenarios where obviously people who know what they're doing within
938.48s - 942.60s |  a network and can actually attack a system will see all these gaps in security and take
942.60s - 948.08s |  advantage of that and then launch their ransomware payloads against the topography of the hospital.
948.08s - 951.40s |  Hospitals used to have a pass from threat actors against doing actions like this, but
951.40s - 956.48s |  that pass has been revoked, as we've been seeing in the recent months, with many hospitals
956.48s - 961.80s |  again being hit by ransomware operators and ransomware firms.
961.80s - 968.84s |  Now, there is a key point, again, continuous adversarial assessments is kind of key.
968.84s - 974.92s |  And one thing I always see when I'm on a hospital network, which is odd, is an OU that says
974.92s - 979.16s |  like defender or semantic disabled.
979.16s - 982.76s |  And then there's a bunch of systems in there and they're normally critical.
982.76s - 989.55s |  There's, I mean, that's data that you basically, as you're ingesting as a threat actor, you
989.55s - 991.67s |  can just take actionable, look it up.
991.67s - 995.03s |  If you're in an internal network for a hospital, look up an OU called disabled.
995.03s - 998.31s |  I guarantee you, you'll probably find one with devices that aren't running any kind
998.31s - 999.31s |  of software.
999.31s - 1004.13s |  And that's for a specific reason, critical, high target assets.
1004.13s - 1006.87s |  So go ahead and take a look if you do those kinds of assessments.
1006.87s - 1011.83s |  But also again, the gears of these organizations are very slow to move.
1011.83s - 1015.63s |  If anybody's ever worked in the medical field, trying to get any kind of change, like, you
1015.63s - 1025.89s |  know, actually accepted is a constant uphill battle.
1025.89s - 1029.41s |  So again, there is a way out of this.
1029.41s - 1034.41s |  And that's, again, getting good goal-based offensive testers actually doing the tests
1034.41s - 1036.49s |  for these.
1036.49s - 1042.85s |  It's funny to me because a lot of times when I come onto a client site, I will just talk
1042.85s - 1043.85s |  to the client.
1043.85s - 1045.33s |  You know, how did your last pen test go?
1045.33s - 1047.41s |  There's things you liked about it, you know, things you didn't.
1047.41s - 1050.89s |  A lot of times they'll just show me the report and I'm like, okay, this is some stuff.
1050.89s - 1056.09s |  But there's some similarities that I'm seeing between the medical testers that I experience
1056.09s - 1059.73s |  is that they're not too thorough.
1059.73s - 1068.49s |  Key point, one client showed me a report, prior test, they got the reverse shell, yay.
1068.49s - 1069.49s |  That was it.
1069.49s - 1070.49s |  Basically, that was the pun.
1070.49s - 1071.85s |  They got a reverse shell.
1071.85s - 1075.81s |  That was the same one that I had the POC that basically blew up the hospital.
1075.81s - 1079.65s |  So there was no post-exploitation, there was nothing done to look for configuration files,
1079.73s - 1083.21s |  there was nothing that was actually done as far as cracking passwords, there was nothing
1083.21s - 1084.93s |  done to escalate privileges.
1084.93s - 1089.69s |  They just got a shell, called it a day, probably scanned it with Nessus and that's it.
1089.69s - 1096.13s |  So there's a little bit of a difference that good offensive adversarial testing can give
1096.13s - 1101.01s |  you versus just the general scan and click and Nessus kind of chill thing.
1101.01s - 1104.41s |  I know it's hard as a person who may be purchasing these things.
1104.41s - 1108.69s |  Again, you may be thinking that the sticker shock of a test who may be $10,000 more than
1108.69s - 1115.01s |  your other tester just because they're local is viable for your operation because you may
1115.01s - 1116.01s |  get a pass.
1116.01s - 1118.89s |  But again, is that going to be cheaper in the long run?
1118.89s - 1120.25s |  Think about this.
1120.25s - 1126.93s |  You get a pass for your devices, you're putting out an X widget and the tester did Nessus
1126.93s - 1132.57s |  and map, everything looks good, it runs, you can put it on the market, you can turn in
1132.57s - 1136.65s |  your artifact that says you had a pen test, but is that really going to be cheaper in
1136.65s - 1142.77s |  the long run if that device gets found to have a critical flaw in the field where possibly
1142.77s - 1144.81s |  could probably kill somebody?
1144.81s - 1149.09s |  And then somebody tries to publish that and then you have to take it off with a recall
1149.09s - 1154.01s |  and then you have to put it back on and submit another $5,000, $10,000.
1154.01s - 1159.13s |  The cost, again, comes up a lot more when you have to do that versus if you just do
1159.13s - 1165.45s |  it right the first time and go with somebody who, say, you know, has a valid reputation
1165.45s - 1168.93s |  for testing these things, has a body of work or something, you know.
1168.93s - 1172.25s |  So when you're doing these kinds of choices for your testers, just kind of research, you
1172.25s - 1176.45s |  know, what they have as far as skill sets and just make sure that everything is a thorough
1176.45s - 1181.22s |  check versus just a reverse shell and we're done.
1181.22s - 1187.06s |  Also, again, when you are getting these things, you know, obviously we want to help you.
1187.06s - 1191.42s |  So what I like to look at is myself as a budgetary tool.
1191.42s - 1196.86s |  The harder I hit the system, that's more money that you get in your pocket for budget.
1196.86s - 1201.78s |  So basically, again, you know, I like to look at myself as kind of a force multiplier.
1201.78s - 1203.94s |  Now, again, wars run through attrition.
1203.94s - 1209.46s |  I've had a lot of open discussions with some medical device vendors, but my hopes are that,
1209.46s - 1213.46s |  again, we can kind of work together in some kind of uniform fashion.
1213.46s - 1217.66s |  I'm kind of tired of people trying to sue me for no fucking reason.
1217.66s - 1223.22s |  So the sooner that they start to wake up and realize that I'm doing this shit for free
1223.22s - 1228.06s |  like here, they should like, you know, accept these things and actually try to work with
1228.06s - 1232.18s |  us versus trying to sue us with litigation because like I don't care about your stupid
1232.18s - 1233.18s |  binaries.
1233.18s - 1240.62s |  Again, case in point, last time I tried to release a CBE, there was group A who, well,
1240.62s - 1243.50s |  there was the first group who was very receptive, everything worked fine.
1243.50s - 1246.06s |  There was group B. They didn't get anything.
1246.06s - 1247.06s |  We talked.
1247.06s - 1248.06s |  We came back.
1248.06s - 1249.06s |  We talked more.
1249.06s - 1251.26s |  They had no understanding what the physical vulnerabilities were going on.
1251.30s - 1255.66s |  They just basically said like, oh, well, you know, I have one guy was screaming, I have
1255.66s - 1256.66s |  a screwdriver.
1256.66s - 1257.90s |  I can break into fucking anything.
1257.90s - 1260.34s |  I'm like, I don't even know what the hell's going on with you, sir.
1260.34s - 1262.62s |  You must be having a bad day.
1262.62s - 1267.34s |  And then you get an email saying, I need you to affirm in writing and certify that X, Y
1267.34s - 1268.34s |  and Z.
1268.34s - 1269.62s |  That comes from the law department.
1269.62s - 1271.10s |  That's not from the person that wrote it.
1271.10s - 1274.14s |  So again, I know what's coming next in that order.
1274.14s - 1280.06s |  So again, I think that hopefully under some time we can actually work together in a cohesive
1280.06s - 1284.34s |  manner and kind of all get together and maybe have beers afterwards.
1284.34s - 1285.98s |  Also wars went through attrition.
1285.98s - 1289.34s |  And this is my view of companies that write their own CBEs.
1289.34s - 1294.98s |  Again, it's kind of hard because if you write the CBE and I'm the researcher, who do you
1294.98s - 1296.54s |  think is going to be the neutral ground?
1296.54s - 1297.58s |  Like there's no neutral ground.
1297.58s - 1298.58s |  I write the CBE.
1298.58s - 1300.02s |  This is what's going to happen.
1300.02s - 1302.82s |  Here's how the here's the here's the severity.
1302.82s - 1307.18s |  You know, nobody's understanding what's actually going on.
1307.18s - 1313.26s |  And again, does this feel like neutral ground if you make the CBE and you have to argue
1313.26s - 1318.18s |  with the same people that are the owners of this project and you basically cannot go off
1318.18s - 1319.18s |  of anything.
1319.18s - 1323.62s |  So, you know, this is this is not neutral, in my opinion.
1323.62s - 1327.58s |  Again, health care is very expensive.
1327.58s - 1331.58s |  So again, we need to make better decisions when we're connecting these devices on the
1331.58s - 1333.40s |  interconnected space.
1333.40s - 1340.56s |  So again, you know, the better we do with making the smart items more secure, the better
1340.56s - 1341.64s |  we'll be in the long run.
1341.64s - 1346.88s |  We'll have less ransomware and less issues kind of plaguing us with regards to severe
1346.88s - 1350.80s |  vulnerabilities in medical devices.
1350.80s - 1354.52s |  Also one thing of note with genetics, don't go away like, you know, just handing out your
1354.52s - 1359.96s |  genetic data to all these random places because it's kind of hard to change your genetic sequence.
1359.96s - 1362.04s |  You can change your driver's license pretty easy.
1362.04s - 1369.20s |  You need like a CRISPR and a lot of time and effort to change your DNA.
1369.20s - 1371.92s |  Again, we can do better.
1371.92s - 1376.60s |  I feel as a group, you know, we can all kind of hopefully come to some kind of agreement
1376.60s - 1380.48s |  that says like, hey, guns down, like, let's just actually start working together.
1380.48s - 1385.40s |  But that's going to be in the future when, again, we actually start realizing that these
1385.40s - 1387.12s |  items are critical assets.
1387.12s - 1392.52s |  When you release a CBE for a medical device, guess who also notes the CBE, CISA, because
1392.56s - 1394.52s |  it's critical infrastructure.
1394.52s - 1398.08s |  So the more we start looking at them as critical, the more that these manufacturers hopefully
1398.08s - 1399.88s |  will start actually making the smartest decisions.
1399.88s - 1403.00s |  Now, mind you, I know that they know that they're critical because they're class two
1403.00s - 1407.32s |  and class three medical devices, but necessarily criticality, I think, differs in our opinion
1407.32s - 1408.32s |  of things.
1408.32s - 1409.32s |  Let's see.
1409.32s - 1410.32s |  Okay, cool.
1410.32s - 1411.32s |  I got one example.
1411.32s - 1412.32s |  Okay.
1412.32s - 1413.32s |  Reason.
1413.32s - 1414.32s |  Okay.
1414.32s - 1415.32s |  Anybody familiar with DICOM?
1415.32s - 1416.32s |  All right.
1416.32s - 1418.92s |  Cool.
1418.92s - 1419.92s |  So has anybody heard of Pedicom?
1419.92s - 1420.92s |  Yeah, you have.
1420.92s - 1423.20s |  Nobody else.
1423.20s - 1424.20s |  Okay, cool.
1424.20s - 1429.20s |  So basically, it was a research project released five years ago.
1429.20s - 1436.28s |  Somebody made the ability to ingest or execute DICOM images from the command line by stuffing
1436.28s - 1439.52s |  a PE header in the 128-byte preamble.
1439.52s - 1444.16s |  So basically, now you have 128 bytes of free space to throw malware.
1444.16s - 1449.36s |  So here is something I'm going to show you.
1449.36s - 1455.48s |  All right.
1455.48s - 1458.69s |  Cool, cool.
1458.69s - 1459.69s |  All right.
1460.01s - 1462.13s |  This is a DICOM file.
1462.13s - 1463.93s |  This is an image, okay?
1463.93s - 1467.37s |  You open it with Radiant, you'll see an image, okay?
1467.37s - 1469.01s |  This is that same DICOM file.
1469.01s - 1470.65s |  This is that same DICOM file running.
1470.65s - 1476.00s |  Let's see.
1476.00s - 1479.24s |  And, well, a second ago, oh, that's why.
1479.24s - 1480.24s |  No network, huh?
1480.24s - 1483.13s |  Funny.
1483.13s - 1484.13s |  Damn it.
1484.13s - 1486.86s |  Sorry.
1486.86s - 1492.14s |  So basically, the whole long story is you can actually execute these images from the
1492.14s - 1494.38s |  command line and you'll get a reverse shell.
1494.38s - 1499.50s |  I'm not going to tell you how because I have tooling to do this and the issue is that the
1499.50s - 1503.58s |  researcher who originally did release this did not release a POC.
1503.58s - 1509.50s |  Now the other issue is that antivirus engines have a hard time scanning these types of files.
1509.50s - 1511.54s |  Reason being is, again, it looks like an image.
1511.54s - 1512.82s |  It opens like an image.
1512.82s - 1514.98s |  In all purposes, it is an image.
1514.98s - 1519.90s |  If you open it up with a DICOM viewer, it will open up and show you the actual image.
1519.90s - 1522.86s |  So that's the issue, is that you lose no file integrity.
1522.86s - 1526.86s |  The image is still intact and now you've chucked 128 bytes of malware and you'll get
1526.86s - 1527.86s |  a reverse shell.
1527.86s - 1533.90s |  If you would like to talk more about that kind of thing, I'll be in the biohacking village
1533.90s - 1536.58s |  doing this to multiple people who ingest DICOM files.
1536.58s - 1542.06s |  So it's going to be an interesting time, but necessarily, again, you can take theoretical
1542.06s - 1544.70s |  research and turn it into actionable data.
1544.70s - 1550.14s |  So now I have a project that, again, shoves malware into DICOM images and due to the way
1550.14s - 1554.02s |  that you have to keep these images, they'll now be on disk for about five to ten years
1554.02s - 1556.34s |  because of rules with deletion.
1556.34s - 1560.18s |  Also there's a worm that will overwrite all of the headers for all the other files that
1560.18s - 1565.54s |  are DICOM in the same directory and basically make them do the same thing.
1565.54s - 1572.18s |  So enjoy that.
1572.18s - 1578.34s |  And other than that, basically, in the end, we can all work together and hopefully we
1578.34s - 1582.98s |  come to some kind of cohesive conclusion where we can actually do things kind of like
1582.98s - 1586.42s |  a family versus apart from each other.
1586.42s - 1588.06s |  And I'll make sure to get these slides online.
1588.06s - 1590.02s |  Sorry, kind of depressed for time and everything.
1590.02s - 1591.54s |  I was going kind of slow initially.
1591.54s - 1597.94s |  Normally I'm pretty spitfire, but tried to talk a little slower.
1597.94s - 1599.66s |  But that's the end.
1599.66s - 1601.46s |  Any questions really quick before we get out?
1601.46s - 1605.21s |  All right.
1605.21s - 1605.41s |  Good to go.
