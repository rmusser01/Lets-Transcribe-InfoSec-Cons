 Thanks and welcome to my talk on analyzing the security of satellite-based air traffic control.
7.36s - 13.36s |  My name is Martin Strohmeyer. I work at the cyber defense campus which is part of the
14.08s - 16.96s |  procurement agency and part of the Swiss Department of Defense.
18.80s - 27.36s |  So DEF CON and other conferences have a long range of talks about attacks on air traffic control.
28.08s - 31.84s |  It's obviously an interesting critical infrastructure.
34.16s - 38.64s |  If you are able to attack something could have potentially catastrophic consequences.
39.44s - 46.32s |  This is an overview of typical technologies, communications, protocols that are being used by
47.60s - 56.00s |  commercial aircraft and other aircraft in flight. And basically since around
56.64s - 62.40s |  the early 2010s a lot of practical attacks on pretty much all of these
63.76s - 67.44s |  communication technologies in aviation have been shown and demonstrated.
69.04s - 74.80s |  The principle is always the same. You examine these standards, aviation standards, they are
74.80s - 81.20s |  known, they're available. There's no security, no authentication in them. You implement them,
81.76s - 87.44s |  you build a receiver. These might also be useful for enthusiasts, plane spotters,
88.40s - 95.68s |  that stuff powers flight radar or flight aware. But from a security perspective if you have a
95.68s - 100.80s |  receiver it's also not difficult to implement a sender or transmitter using software-defined
100.80s - 106.88s |  radios. And when you do that you can do security analysis and you profit. And that's something that
106.88s - 112.96s |  has been done for all of these technologies, whether it's aircraft aircraft, aircraft ground,
112.96s - 120.88s |  or also GPS is well known. And since they all have no security built-in it's not difficult
120.88s - 129.60s |  to attack them, it's quite obvious. But a few technologies nicely fitting in with the aerospace
129.60s - 138.16s |  topic have come up over the past decade or so where aircraft are talking to satellites and
138.16s - 142.00s |  kind of trying to replace some of these technologies or at least enhance them. So that's
142.00s - 150.64s |  what this talk will be about. Just a quick teaser, my colleagues will have a talk tomorrow on
150.64s - 157.36s |  Creative Stage 2 attacking the collision avoidance system. So that was one of the last technologies
157.36s - 165.36s |  that hadn't been demonstrated from this whole overview. So tomorrow 14.15 that's your
166.64s - 172.96s |  opportunity to see a real attack on this as well. But this talk is about space-based
172.96s - 178.40s |  air traffic control. So what do we understand under that? There's two different technologies
178.40s - 185.04s |  actually. One I'll touch on briefly and one more in detail. First one is satellite ADS-B
185.52s - 192.16s |  and the second one is the so-called ADS-C, ADS contract. So let's look at that.
193.52s - 200.32s |  Satellite ADS-B, you all probably have heard of these ADS-B attacks. There have been
201.52s - 208.24s |  talks since 2010. People like RenderMan have had main stage talks demonstrating the problem here.
209.20s - 216.80s |  It's well known to be vulnerable. The terrestrial transponder technology, aircraft sending data to
216.80s - 225.20s |  the ground, trivial to receive, send ghost aircraft, everything is possible. The problem is
225.20s - 231.92s |  space-based ADS-B is essentially just the same. Some companies have built constellations in low
232.00s - 240.08s |  earth orbit and they're simply picking up these same terrestrial signals and then giving them to
240.96s - 245.84s |  air navigation service providers to air traffic control. That is obviously helpful where you
245.84s - 252.00s |  don't have terrestrial receivers, so over the oceans or in mountainous areas. One of these
252.00s - 258.48s |  providers, Aerion, also on the homepage they say, yeah, it's just ADS-B. There's nothing else here.
259.36s - 267.36s |  What they however also said when they went widely public with it, said, okay,
268.32s - 276.72s |  we're 485 miles up in space, so you can't attack that. It's not like somebody is attacking that
276.72s - 281.68s |  signal. They could attack GPS, which they can, and obviously is a widespread problem,
281.68s - 286.80s |  in particular over the past year now, but they're not going to attack the actual terrestrial ADS-B
287.44s - 295.36s |  signal. 500 miles up in space, too far away. At the time we already thought, honestly,
295.36s - 300.16s |  there's bullshit. It's just an engineering problem. You need more power. You can do just the
300.16s - 309.36s |  same. They pick up the signals from aircraft flying 30,000 feet, 10 kilometers. They pick
309.36s - 315.36s |  that up in space. What's 10 kilometers more sending from the ground? It's not a problem,
315.36s - 323.12s |  quite obviously. Yes, space is quite obviously not inherently secure. We've seen this last year,
323.68s - 330.32s |  latest last year here at Hackersat. Of course, you can communicate with satellites in two way
331.04s - 341.97s |  and attack them. I think there's no doubt about this. Back then, at least we postulated a
341.97s - 350.13s |  theoretic attack. We didn't actually send to their satellites. Would not be legal, but we said,
350.13s - 357.65s |  hey, here, these are kind of the requirements that you have to think about relation, position
357.65s - 365.01s |  relation to the aircraft and the satellites, and then you can simply send ghost aircraft also to
365.01s - 372.74s |  these satellites. Not a problem. So very much possible. We haven't done it in practice for
372.74s - 380.02s |  regulatory reasons, but it's certainly not secure. There's no reason to believe so.
380.98s - 386.90s |  That brings me to the second technology, ADSC, which is much less well known, I would say.
388.34s - 395.06s |  It's been developed already late 90s, but only become quite popular over the past
395.06s - 403.30s |  five or 10 years. Also in the wake of the MHL-70 incident, tracking aircraft over oceans
403.30s - 411.38s |  has become quite a popular topic. So what does ADSC or full name Automatic Dependent
411.38s - 417.22s |  Surveillance contract actually do? Well, it picks up aircraft information
418.18s - 422.82s |  and sends it to air traffic service units, they call it, which is basically ground stations.
423.70s - 429.30s |  There are dozens or even hundreds around the world. And this information includes aircraft
429.30s - 435.94s |  position, altitude, speed, navigational intent, metrological data. Of course, this is all very
435.94s - 441.14s |  useful for air traffic control, air traffic surveillance, route monitoring, in particular,
441.14s - 446.18s |  if you're over the Atlantic or Pacific and have no updates from your aircraft and where they are.
448.70s - 458.06s |  This is roughly the setup. Aircraft gets their position, of course, also from GNSS, GPS services.
459.26s - 465.74s |  It then connects to different types of satellites, typically geostationary satellites from
465.74s - 471.90s |  Inmarsat, but it can also be actually LEO Constellations also offer these services.
472.78s - 477.66s |  And then the satellites forward the data to the ground and there it's being routed
477.66s - 487.74s |  to the navigation service provider who require that content. There's also VHF, HF version of
487.74s - 497.66s |  all of this, but that's not what we're looking at here. What's the purpose? I think I alluded to it.
498.54s - 504.78s |  Goal is really to enable aircraft monitoring in very remote areas. We don't have terrestrial
504.78s - 510.54s |  surveillance of aircraft. If you do that, if you know where the aircraft are, rather than just
511.26s - 518.78s |  roughly estimating from, you know, leaving US mainland towards Europe after two hours,
518.78s - 523.66s |  you might not really know where they are anymore. If you know where they are, you can more efficiently
524.38s - 528.62s |  utilize the airspace because you can minimize separation between different aircraft.
529.50s - 536.62s |  And the second effect, you reduce the reliance on traditional voice communication between pilots
536.62s - 542.62s |  and controllers. These channels are quite congested, quite busy, and you can, like this,
542.62s - 549.02s |  if you put a lot of the data on these digital satellite channels, you can use these for more
549.02s - 557.90s |  urgent correspondence. There's roughly a comparison. This is a image from ASB exchange
557.90s - 566.70s |  and it shows roughly where you can have crowdsourced terrestrial reception of aircraft
566.70s - 577.26s |  signals. So by and large, that's where a lot of people live and also a lot of, let's say,
577.98s - 583.74s |  more wealthy people live who can put up receivers on the ground and feed it to these systems.
584.46s - 591.18s |  All of the red areas, you will never have any reception, any surveillance of aircraft.
592.30s - 598.62s |  So if we overlay this with ADC coverage, we can see that this sort of satellite coverage
599.58s - 606.78s |  fills in a lot of the red gaps, certainly Pacific, Atlantic, even Indian Ocean, and
607.90s - 616.46s |  also partly you can see over Africa and some other terrestrial areas. So how does ADC actually work?
620.06s - 622.94s |  Let's look first at uplink and then at downlink messages.
623.50s - 630.14s |  Basically, ADC, they initiate the connection always. So they request a certain aircraft
630.14s - 637.42s |  that's flying to provide them with a so-called contract that can either be periodic.
638.78s - 643.74s |  With that sort of periodic contract, you maybe get regular updates every 10 minutes or so
644.30s - 648.86s |  of position, altitude, and the other information they want, or they can ask for certain events.
649.02s - 656.06s |  So, for example, when they want a waypoint change, so when aircraft is flying towards
656.06s - 660.94s |  a certain waypoint and they know that, and they can request a change of that waypoint
660.94s - 670.70s |  through these contracts. That's roughly how the message is looking, but I won't get into detail here.
671.90s - 677.58s |  And then we have the probably more interesting downlink part. So this is the waypoint change
677.82s - 685.26s |  part. So this is where the aircraft answers with ADC reports, which go to the air traffic control
686.62s - 692.38s |  service provider. The aircraft sends, as I said, for example, periodic updates,
692.38s - 701.02s |  position, everything every 10 minutes, or in these events, if change events cases,
701.02s - 706.94s |  it sends certain reports regarding that. Again, that's what the messages look like. They will
706.94s - 712.78s |  include position, latitude, longitude, altitude, some timestamp, and then depending on the type of
712.78s - 720.94s |  the report, it will include some more information. So why is all that important? I slightly alluded
720.94s - 728.30s |  to this already. If we don't have this kind of new modern technology, the air traffic controllers
728.30s - 735.50s |  will have to rely on pre-computed aircraft trajectories, roughly guesstimating where
735.50s - 740.06s |  the aircraft is, which is not so great for surveillance. And they will use the voice
740.06s - 745.58s |  communication, just the same finding out where the aircraft is and what they're doing, in particular
745.58s - 753.10s |  in remote areas using HF and the likes, and that's not the most precise technology or the most
753.10s - 760.06s |  available one. So in short, ADC is very crucial for aircraft monitoring in these areas. It's being
760.06s - 765.18s |  rolled out, as we've seen on the map, quite a lot of commercial aircraft have it now
765.98s - 772.70s |  and use it. And in contrast to many of the other technologies that were in the earlier slides,
772.70s - 779.42s |  this hasn't been studied at all, not in terms of use cases really in the scientific community, but
779.42s - 786.94s |  also in the security community in terms of, well, what can we do with it? What can we do against it?
789.18s - 796.62s |  So what about security? There is a paper on this on what I'm going to say. So we talked about this
796.62s - 804.86s |  at this year's SpaceX workshop already, but if you prefer it in written form, you can look it up,
805.58s - 812.62s |  but I cover most of this in the following slides. So that's our system model and our
812.62s - 819.34s |  threat model. Basically, we have the satellite in the middle, we have the ground earth station,
819.34s - 825.74s |  as they call it, and we have the aircraft earth station, which might sound a bit weird, but
825.74s - 830.38s |  you know, aircraft is still on the earth while a satellite is not. So that's why they call it
831.42s - 836.06s |  that way. Different frequencies that we have to look at. So the aircraft
837.18s - 841.82s |  uses the 1.6 gigahertz frequency to talk to the satellite. And then there's a different
841.82s - 847.90s |  up and down frequency from the satellite to the ground station, 3.6 gigahertz and 6.5 gigahertz.
848.62s - 853.02s |  And we have three different types of attackers that we consider. The first one is a passive
853.02s - 860.78s |  attacker. You could also call it an eavesdropper. The eavesdropper simply needs to be in range of
860.78s - 867.02s |  the whole satellite beam of the geostationary satellite. So that's not very complicated.
867.58s - 875.18s |  We have realized that at least in Europe, you need to be in a 5G free zone to listen to the
875.18s - 882.94s |  downlink because the 3.6 gigahertz area frequency is exactly, at least in Europe, the 5G frequency
884.46s - 890.22s |  or one of the 5G frequencies. And if you have one of these transmitters, ground stations nearby,
890.22s - 895.98s |  you will not be able to receive the very weak satellite signals. So that was an issue that we
895.98s - 902.62s |  had to contend with. Then we have two active attackers. One is attacking the downlink. So
902.62s - 910.54s |  basically transmitting the same data as we see on the downlink towards the earth station and an
910.54s - 916.46s |  uplink attacker. So somebody who sends to the satellite, which is more complicated, absolutely.
916.46s - 923.74s |  You need more power. And we've been speaking to some experts, depending on the satellite setup,
924.70s - 931.50s |  there may be some beam forming going on. So it might not be sufficient to stay in
932.62s - 937.34s |  just anywhere in the satellite beam. You may also need to be close to a ground station,
937.34s - 944.75s |  depending on the satellite setup. So let's go through it one by one. What can we do with
944.75s - 950.67s |  eavesdropping on ADC messages? The content we've seen is mostly position, waypoints.
951.63s - 957.71s |  There's some meta information such as the aircraft ID and some identifiers. And
958.99s - 966.67s |  mostly this is useful for reconnaissance on aircraft. So you know where they are,
966.67s - 973.39s |  you know what they sent, you know where they're going. That is quite nice. It can be used for
974.43s - 979.95s |  attacks on aircraft, also on other protocols, or for active attacks on ADC itself.
980.83s - 987.79s |  We can link these identifiers to databases that are available online. And then from there,
988.59s - 994.11s |  you may imagine a lot of privacy violations. I'm sure you've seen all the kerfuffle about people
994.67s - 1002.03s |  tracking Elon Musk or Taylor Swift's aircraft, right? If you haven't, then I can recommend my
1002.03s - 1008.91s |  talk, The Village, last year. I think it's just been put online last week, so you can find it on
1008.91s - 1018.90s |  YouTube. Let's move on towards the active attacks, first on the uplink. And here,
1020.42s - 1026.02s |  mostly what you can do is different sorts of denial of service attacks. So if we look at the
1026.02s - 1034.02s |  protocol here, the aircraft locks on, it will be confirmed, it will be acknowledged. And of course,
1034.02s - 1042.18s |  if you attack this handshake, then you might simply be able to prevent the lock on,
1042.18s - 1049.94s |  and then there is no ADC connection. That's, yeah, it's a denial of service of ADC. You have other
1050.90s - 1055.94s |  technologies available, of course. So it's not immediately safety relevant at all.
1056.66s - 1063.54s |  But it's certainly an attack. And there are several places in the protocol where you can do
1063.54s - 1071.54s |  this. On the downlink end, it gets a bit more interesting. Here, you can do spoofing of aircraft
1071.54s - 1082.50s |  positions towards the air traffic control provider. What you can't do, just to preface this,
1083.22s - 1090.82s |  is to inject ghost aircraft. Why? Because as we've seen earlier, the air traffic controller
1090.82s - 1097.38s |  always initiates the connection to an aircraft. So they will do that towards an aircraft they
1097.38s - 1105.14s |  know is already flying. And if they get a response, okay, great. But if they get a response
1105.14s - 1109.62s |  from an aircraft they haven't initiated a connection with, it will just be discarded and
1109.62s - 1114.74s |  ignored. If however, they already have a connection, then it's absolutely possible
1114.74s - 1119.86s |  to send different positions than the one from the aircraft. And we've illustrated this here
1119.94s - 1126.74s |  with our own setup. So on the left, we have real aircraft positions that we received.
1126.74s - 1132.26s |  And you can just send, you know, for the same aircraft, 10 positions clustering together,
1132.82s - 1139.30s |  and it would be displayed this way. Likewise, you can flood ground stations with emergency
1139.30s - 1144.58s |  mode messages from basically all the existing aircraft that they have a contract with.
1145.14s - 1149.94s |  That's the picture of the flight management system here. That's what a pilot can put this on.
1149.94s - 1156.98s |  And then of course, they will be flagged with the air traffic controller and get priority,
1157.54s - 1162.82s |  get certain routines set up. And here you can basically do this for all the aircraft at the
1162.82s - 1168.58s |  same time, which would again be causing some chaos and some denial of service.
1169.46s - 1177.14s |  We've done some real world evaluation as far as that is legally possible. That's our receiver
1177.14s - 1186.82s |  setup. So we've both set up downlink and uplink receivers. The pipelines for the receivers are
1186.82s - 1194.02s |  available online on GitHub. I have a later slide, but mostly you can download it, put it
1194.58s - 1201.38s |  together with your software defined radios and antennas. Then you have to look, follow tutorials,
1201.38s - 1207.94s |  look at the channels, and you can receive the data. You have to check also which satellite
1207.94s - 1215.94s |  is in your area. So this is the InMarsat coverage of the geo satellites. So for us,
1215.94s - 1221.70s |  it would be the AlphaSat. If we look at it in Europe, in the US, you would get different satellites
1221.70s - 1229.38s |  and their aircraft connections. That's the pipeline, the setup. Definitely credit to
1229.38s - 1236.42s |  all these people who've written the super interesting, super useful receiver software,
1237.06s - 1242.58s |  SDR receiver, Jero, and a lot of tutorials. You set the whole thing up, save the data,
1243.30s - 1250.18s |  and analyze it. That's what we did. That's how these setups look like. The uplink, much easier,
1250.18s - 1255.70s |  as you see, can be a super small antenna on the left. For the downlink, you need something in the
1257.70s - 1266.90s |  eight feet-ish size. So your house might be, you might have to have a decent size garden for this.
1268.42s - 1274.18s |  Some data insights. We just looked at this for a few weeks, collected a lot of messages. You see
1274.18s - 1282.34s |  the black points, which are the positions here, 2,500 aircraft communicating with 50, 60 ground
1282.34s - 1288.26s |  stations. If you want to see more on this, other people are collecting the data as well. So tbg
1288.26s - 1298.34s |  airframes.io, you always get the last two days. These are typical routes that you can follow
1298.34s - 1306.34s |  with that setup. Then, as I've mentioned, we arrested, we built a transmitter, and it works.
1306.34s - 1312.10s |  It's straightforward student work, building a transmitter from a receiver, from all of these
1312.74s - 1321.70s |  existing SDR implementations. We tested it. It's fairly binary. We set up our own ground station.
1322.26s - 1328.50s |  We tested the transmitter. It can generate arbitrary messages on ADS-C,
1328.50s - 1334.50s |  including all of the sublayers. So we injected these messages into our dish, into our ground
1334.50s - 1344.02s |  stations. And lo and behold, it works. So if you have a receiver software, ADS-C, you can simply
1344.02s - 1350.90s |  inject any legitimately looking message, and you cannot tell it apart from the messages that we get
1350.90s - 1359.68s |  from an aircraft. That brings me to the conclusion of my talk today. I hope I could explain that
1359.68s - 1365.04s |  satellite edge of control certainly helps increase airspace efficiency in many areas.
1365.60s - 1369.20s |  Unfortunately, security was never a concern. There's no authentication,
1369.76s - 1376.16s |  which is as problematic in space as on the ground. Passive attackers can eavesdrop and

1383.44s - 1387.36s |  And you can follow a lot of aircraft just with a single receiver, which is nice.
1389.04s - 1394.32s |  Active attackers can inject signals and disrupt air traffic control to a certain extent.
