**Introduction to Industrial Control Systems**

- Presenters: Bryson Bort and Tom VanNorman
- Focus on **Industrial Control Systems (ICS)** and hands-on experience
- Importance of understanding ICS compared to Information Technology (IT)

**Understanding Industrial Control Systems**

- **Definition**: ICS are systems that manage industrial operations
- Difference from IT: ICS is about **resilience and availability**, not just confidentiality and integrity
- Impact: Failure in ICS can affect **health, life, and safety**

**Purdue Model**

- **Purpose**: Nominal enterprise architecture breaking down into five levels
- Levels include IT, DMZ, and specific control zones with engineering workstations and programmable logic controllers
- **Segmentation and Conduits**: Key to maintaining control and preventing issues from spreading

**Threats and Security in ICS**

- Common threats include:
  - **Direct internet connection** of operational technology devices
  - **IT environment vulnerabilities** that allow crossover to ICS
- Importance of understanding **defense in depth** and threat vectors

**Building an ICS Lab**

- **Purpose**: To learn and conduct vulnerability research
- **Components**: Use real controllers, not just virtualized systems
- Challenges include sourcing equipment and licenses

**Learning and Training**

- **ICS Village**: Provides hands-on demos and training opportunities
- Importance of understanding network **authentication** and **segmentation**
- **Best Practices**: Regularly update certifications and test patches before production deployment

**Conclusion**

- Encouragement to explore ICS through volunteering and utilizing resources like ICS Village
- Emphasis on ongoing learning and practical application of skills in ICS environments
