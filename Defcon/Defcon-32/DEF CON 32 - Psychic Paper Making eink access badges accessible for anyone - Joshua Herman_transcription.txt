  "description": "To make RFID access badges vendors in China have created eink badges where instead of printing a badge out you instead program the eink portion of the badge with an smartphone app and then program the RFID portion. At this time the ones that are sold are either black and white or black and white and red. There is no security implemented so all you need to do is download the app to reprogram the front of the badge. This makes anyone able to reprogram both the front and back of the badge.",

0.00s - 8.00s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Hi, sorry for the set-up issues.
8.00s - 11.10s |  This is my talk about psychic paper.
11.10s - 22.36s |  It's how to use e-ink displays and also e-paper displays to fake the front of identification
22.36s - 33.98s |  badges and also discussion about the two or three e-ink systems that are pre-made from
33.98s - 41.00s |  suppliers and how they have lax security and unusual sign-up.
41.00s - 42.42s |  My handler is ZittoBBGong.
42.42s - 49.10s |  I'm a frequent of the DEF CON Discord.
49.10s - 56.00s |  But more about who I am, I have 11 years of experience in the software industry.
56.00s - 61.24s |  This is a hobby project and this is not related to my employer.
61.24s - 67.00s |  I've actually had to add that to my presentations because people think that they're too advanced
67.00s - 70.90s |  to actually not be related to my hobby.
70.90s - 73.00s |  So what is this talk about?
73.00s - 83.38s |  This talk is about the application of two to three color e-ink displays and also a design
83.38s - 93.66s |  prototype of a five color e-ink display that would be much more effective in red teaming
93.66s - 99.54s |  and or physical red teaming and social engineering.
99.54s - 106.02s |  Anecdotally, I talked with a person at DEF CON and they were able to replicate someone's
106.02s - 115.46s |  badge by looking for a high-resolution picture, copy and pasting it into an image editor
115.46s - 117.96s |  and then printing it out.
117.96s - 126.98s |  This system, while having a lower resolution, could be done in real time and also it could
126.98s - 135.56s |  be replaced real time too and combined with RFID knowledge that has been done in many
135.56s - 143.28s |  DEF CON talks, you could basically clone an entire employee ID badge or physical access
143.28s - 155.46s |  badge that uses RFID and or other technologies like MIFID and so forth.
155.46s - 159.60s |  So first we're going to go through three color e-ink displays.
159.60s - 163.32s |  These can be found on Amazon and Alibaba.
163.32s - 165.60s |  They are very easily sourced.
165.60s - 169.52s |  They are much durable than the research prototype I have.
169.52s - 176.56s |  They are reprogrammable and they have a weird way that you have to program them.
176.56s - 186.84s |  So this is the nice pictures from Amazon that they put and on the upper right side that's
186.84s - 190.28s |  the real thing.
190.28s - 197.26s |  A good idea to understand the difference between e-ink, e-paper and traditional display
197.26s - 205.20s |  technologies or not really traditional but light emissive versus non-light emissive.
205.20s - 217.24s |  So non-light emissive technologies require power and they require the emission of light.
217.24s - 229.56s |  OLED, LCD and so forth, by that nature, the obvious emission of light requires thermodynamically,
229.56s - 231.60s |  you need a power source.
231.60s - 241.44s |  On e-ink and or e-paper, e-ink is trademarked so e-ink TM, it's an electromechanical device
241.44s - 243.56s |  and what does that mean?
243.56s - 254.28s |  Electrical devices are devices that literally just move by an electric charge and then stop.
254.28s - 266.22s |  Because they stop, they can not acquire a power source after programming.
266.22s - 274.74s |  I talked with someone in a previous talk I gave at another conference and they told
274.74s - 286.46s |  me that they had a 12-year-old e-ink or e-paper device with the image for that long and there
286.46s - 291.82s |  was no image degradation.
291.82s - 298.74s |  But why I call this three color is that technically there are three colors, there is white, red
298.78s - 300.18s |  and black.
300.18s - 308.54s |  Now the other difference between e-paper and other light emissive such as LED and OLED
308.54s - 313.38s |  is that because this is electromechanical, you technically have three colors and it's
313.38s - 320.38s |  not RGB, it's white-ish, black and red.
320.38s - 326.74s |  You can see this and also if you had a Kindle, it's pretty obvious that white is not white-ish
326.74s - 327.74s |  also.
327.74s - 333.48s |  But even in the picture, you can see what two white is and white.
333.48s - 339.24s |  So that's a big thing to consider.
339.24s - 362.04s |  So this is a demo, it was on Amazon about just a two color.
362.04s - 375.97s |  As you can see the housing too, that will be important in the five color prototype.
375.97s - 382.33s |  So you could basically remake this especially if they use only a QR code to authenticate
382.37s - 389.61s |  people by just getting the data off the QR code and then using the e-ink or e-paper programmer
389.61s - 397.02s |  and then scanning it.
397.02s - 406.50s |  So some types of the suppliers are, the software is made by Hippo Inc, I'm not sure how to
406.50s - 408.78s |  pronounce that.
408.78s - 417.74s |  The APK must be downloaded from Hong Kong IP addresses or you have to be there.
417.74s - 424.46s |  There's the active version that is also $100, the non-active version is around $40.
424.46s - 432.22s |  The active version has a button and a USB-C possibly to reprogram, but it's pretty obvious
432.22s - 437.06s |  that they have to have some kind of battery to do that.
437.06s - 443.42s |  Those need phones to connect to, the higher priced one uses an iOS device, but I'm only
443.42s - 447.50s |  going to at least show the Android one.
447.50s - 451.62s |  So this is more an expanded on how to reprogram those three color.
451.62s - 458.30s |  You need a Hong Kong IP address, use a VPN too, MulVAD seems to work.
458.30s - 465.46s |  You must silo the APK, you still must be using a Hong Kong IP address to download the APK.
466.06s - 468.02s |  They have a link.
468.02s - 471.14s |  You must create the login, still using the VPN.
471.14s - 477.82s |  It has this weird setup, you use email, you set up a password, and then you have pseudo
477.82s - 484.22s |  two-factor that's emailed to you.
484.22s - 489.68s |  Then you can upload the badge.
489.68s - 496.52s |  The cards have 125 kHz NFC on it.
496.52s - 503.64s |  The important part is, I believe, like aluminum tape or just to remove it if you want to use
503.64s - 516.12s |  any other RFID technology, so you don't want to confuse the RFID or NFC sensor.
516.12s - 525.24s |  The passive ones also uses NFC to reprogram, so I suggest putting on the back or just put
525.24s - 528.78s |  it in your pocket.
528.78s - 532.82s |  Now I'm going to go into more of the prototype design I made.
532.82s - 535.42s |  So this is the more interesting part.
535.42s - 543.50s |  It was not in the talk description, but I mean, why not?
543.50s - 551.50s |  So as you can see on the right, there is an ePaper ESP32 circuit board.
551.50s - 555.08s |  It then connects to the ePaper device.
555.08s - 557.56s |  You can see that the fidelity is much better.
557.56s - 564.48s |  The white is still off-white, but it's much more high-resolution.
564.48s - 571.64s |  Also there's this, but also the purple part is the bezel.
571.64s - 576.30s |  The orange part is the physical display connector.
576.30s - 585.92s |  The middle part is a shim that they do where it takes one connector and adds it to another.
586.92s - 590.12s |  The middle part is part of the programmer.
590.12s - 601.24s |  There is also a Raspberry Pi hat, and in the future, if I were to redo it, I would have
601.24s - 602.88s |  done it that way.
602.88s - 614.82s |  This programmer either has unreliable behavior, or when I've unplugged and plugged the orange
614.82s - 617.90s |  part, it breaks my programming.
617.90s - 624.62s |  So I have to do more research on that, but you could also do it as a one-and-done engagement
624.62s - 631.40s |  anyways, since the person who I talked about doing the physical engagement when he printed
631.40s - 637.06s |  it out, he said he used it for the full engagement and nobody noticed for a month.
637.06s - 642.14s |  So this is a more high-fidelity nobody looks at, but you can also do active programming
642.18s - 650.62s |  by going in from one security, taking a picture about somebody else's picture with higher
650.62s - 657.43s |  level clearance, reprogram, and so forth.
657.43s - 664.79s |  This is the most important part and most technical part of it.
664.79s - 669.91s |  I had to find a wallet that would cover the bezel.
669.91s - 673.71s |  Do you see this bezel?
673.71s - 690.46s |  I did find a wallet.
690.46s - 691.46s |  This is on Amazon.
691.46s - 698.30s |  This is not an ad for the wallet, but I don't know if you can see that this well, but it
698.30s - 702.14s |  covers the bezel.
702.14s - 712.54s |  And number two is your friend is also called double-sided tape, and why does that matter?
712.54s - 718.38s |  You want this to generally be in place so that the bezel scene is minimized?
719.30s - 723.82s |  Sometimes people might notice the purple part and also you don't want it to fall out.
723.82s - 730.98s |  I would also recommend to use that so it doesn't fall out either, although it's pretty tight
730.98s - 742.28s |  if you don't cut anything, but yeah, double-sided tape is really important.
742.28s - 754.12s |  Cutting the bezels was annoying because this is in inches and the display prototype or
754.12s - 763.85s |  the display I'm using is in metric, so millimeters.
763.85s - 769.69s |  So the affected display that you have to program X640 by 400, there are five colors in display
769.69s - 773.85s |  which increases the fidelity.
773.85s - 776.73s |  Since it's more do-it-yourself, it makes it more fragile.
776.73s - 781.33s |  The RFID and NFC component can be separate.
781.33s - 783.17s |  There are two ways that you can integrate it.
783.17s - 793.41s |  One, cut the back of the display, I mean back of the wallet, paste the RFID device or anything
793.41s - 797.53s |  inside, remove the RFID shielding because this one is shielding.
797.53s - 802.33s |  I couldn't find one without shielding, and put it inside.
802.33s - 807.61s |  Another way would be to take a picture of the back of the wallet, make a sticker on
807.61s - 814.17s |  Sticker Mule, and then use double-sided tape on the RFID device and then put the sticker
814.17s - 819.82s |  on top of that.
819.82s - 830.52s |  So this is sort of a basic summary of the steps to do.
830.52s - 832.80s |  You could also make your own lanyard.
832.80s - 843.16s |  I actually think to make a less prototype or more like a release version would be for
843.16s - 855.64s |  me to replicate this white design and 3D print it, and then add Bluetooth programming or
855.64s - 869.34s |  something else, and maybe also add the NFC holder on the back.
869.34s - 875.54s |  So the brand for the wallet I'm using is Cavaleo.
875.54s - 879.10s |  It's a police-style badge.
879.10s - 888.02s |  I don't recommend using the other part because that's very illegal.
888.02s - 899.50s |  You can see the resolution of this e-paper device, its wave share, and then the HID card.
899.50s - 904.82s |  You can either get these cards from online.
904.82s - 908.18s |  You could get it by buying a Proxmark.
908.18s - 912.58s |  You could get one by forgetting to return your hotel badges.
912.58s - 914.90s |  It depends.
914.90s - 923.18s |  There are two general frequencies, 125 kHz and I believe 4 and 15 MHz, but it really
923.18s - 931.94s |  depends on the situation on what you're doing, and programming is annoying.
931.94s - 933.92s |  ESP32 driver board.
933.92s - 939.10s |  You can use a phone for the three-color.
939.10s - 949.58s |  The five-color also has the ability to do programming online, so it's sort of weird.
949.58s - 955.10s |  The ESP32 has two ways to do online programming, like through a website.
955.10s - 959.78s |  One is a Bluetooth one that I couldn't get working, and two is the Wi-Fi one, and the
959.78s - 963.30s |  Wi-Fi one is extremely finicky.
963.30s - 967.62s |  I look in console, and if you do it, it crashes.
967.62s - 971.94s |  It says post does not work, and you have to do it in a specific order.
971.94s - 977.30s |  If you do it in the wrong order, you could have real problems, and I would overwrite
977.30s - 979.06s |  the driver board.
979.06s - 984.92s |  This is why I don't want to use this driver board anymore.
984.92s - 990.06s |  There are many upsides for the Raspberry Pi usage.
990.06s - 1001.83s |  There was a DEF CON talk where they did a real-time badge cloning of RFID, and they
1001.83s - 1011.03s |  used Raspberry Pis, which means that you could combine this into that talk, and then you
1011.03s - 1016.15s |  wouldn't even need this driver board.
1016.15s - 1018.23s |  WaveShare also has a wiki.
1018.23s - 1024.91s |  It's okay, but there are no alternative suppliers to this.
1024.91s - 1029.43s |  This is the best solution I've seen.
1029.43s - 1037.55s |  4.01 inches is really hard to find, and also, the purpose of these e-ink, or why they even
1037.55s - 1043.11s |  exist are for digital signage.
1043.11s - 1055.86s |  If you go to a Kohl's, or a Best Buy, they have a lot of prices on the walls, and they
1055.86s - 1063.36s |  use it to automatically change it and possibly rip you off more.
1063.36s - 1066.12s |  This is more about the driver board.
1066.12s - 1072.40s |  It physically attaches, it connects to e-paper, and it supports Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
1072.40s - 1076.64s |  Once you do programming, though, it's not needed.
1076.64s - 1083.24s |  It could be a one-and-done engagement, really, considering how it is.
1083.24s - 1086.94s |  It's very slightly inexpensive.
1086.94s - 1097.80s |  It's below $40.
1097.80s - 1104.44s |  How I recommend is, smartphones should be able to write it to the e-paper using the
1104.44s - 1113.08s |  Wi-Fi, but the Wi-Fi setup has to be programmed specifically as a static IP, and I thought
1113.08s - 1119.56s |  of doing a demo like that, but it would require too much overhead, and also, Wi-Fi is spotty,
1119.56s - 1123.16s |  and I'd have to bring some kind of Wi-Fi device.
1123.16s - 1128.16s |  I also, possibly, if you're going to do this yourself, to add a metal plate, they're not
1128.16s - 1137.68s |  expensive to do, just to make the wallet more rigid, because you can crack this quite easily
1137.68s - 1146.40s |  by dropping it, so the aluminum would at least make it more rigid, and I believe the padding
1146.40s - 1150.34s |  in the wallet gives you enough.
1150.34s - 1152.46s |  The battery programmer is like a poxmark.
1152.46s - 1157.14s |  You plug in the serial port, there's a lot of tutorials to do it, to write badge, read
1157.14s - 1161.78s |  the badge from one, and then write, and then put it, you could put it behind the prototype
1161.78s - 1167.90s |  badge, that's more advanced thing than your emulating, but the top three would be, and
1167.90s - 1172.98s |  it, by putting in, I mean, putting in behind the prototyping badges, you put in the programmed
1172.98s - 1176.58s |  RFID behind it, or keep it on you.
1176.62s - 1184.18s |  It depends on how good you want to make it.
1184.18s - 1204.14s |  So, any questions?
1204.14s - 1219.28s |  Believe it's white, red, I believe it's white, red, black, oh, it's seven, yeah, you can
1219.28s - 1226.69s |  see it here, white, blue, green, red, black, yellow, orange.
1226.69s - 1241.79s |  It's the spinner.
1241.79s - 1248.68s |  The bill of materials, if you were to redo this, would be, the e-paper display is around
1248.68s - 1271.18s |  $30 or $40, the wallet is another $30, the programmer is another $20, so around $200.
1271.18s - 1279.58s |  It depends on how you're doing the RFID reprogramming, you can use a poxmark, or, on the other hand,
1279.58s - 1285.99s |  if it's a physical, if you're doing a physical one, you could just take somebody's and use
1285.99s - 1298.18s |  the double-sided tape and the other sticker I alluded to.
1298.18s - 1316.14s |  I can't hear, I can't hear what you say, software side of what?
1316.14s - 1323.49s |  It's an Arduino sketch that you get, it's an Arduino sketch that is given to you by
1323.49s - 1324.49s |  Waveshare.
1332.42s - 1343.02s |  Do not use Arduino IDE, use the previous, the Arduino IDE have had problems, using a
1343.02s - 1350.26s |  Mac has problems, using a window machine was the only way I could get it to work.
1350.26s - 1363.83s |  It has this weird, when I program it, even though it'll verify and it shows up in tools,
1363.83s - 1378.98s |  and here's what I was alluding to, you can see how janky this is.
1378.98s - 1388.34s |  You have to program the SSID, password, static IP, gateway, subnet, DNS, to connect to Wi-Fi.
1388.34s - 1397.47s |  What I think was cool, or funny, was they also programmed the whole HTML website here.
1397.47s - 1402.63s |  That's how they get it to, that's how they get the ESP32 to work.
1402.99s - 1406.03s |  It's not a server, it's a client.
1406.03s - 1417.50s |  Server.h is this website serving, server.h means to connect to a server, and then it
1417.50s - 1418.50s |  displays this.
1418.50s - 1425.69s |  I don't know why there's script A, B, C, and D, there's a Bluetooth one too, I couldn't
1425.69s - 1448.67s |  get that one to work.
1448.67s - 1455.27s |  You can see there's, it's probably hard to see, but it uses, it says, you have to also
1455.27s - 1458.43s |  use the board ESP2 dev module.
1458.43s - 1466.23s |  That means that you have to be connected to the internet to get the module parameters
1466.23s - 1471.47s |  or setup, because Arduino does not come with that by default.
1471.47s - 1482.63s |  What I meant by the Arduino version, so this is 1.8.29, so Arduino forks themselves by
1482.63s - 1493.87s |  the IDE, where they have an Arduino IDE, and they have the Arduino regular system, or programming
1493.87s - 1496.71s |  system, not IDE.
1496.71s - 1505.87s |  When I tried programming with the traditional IDE, it had, I had lots of problems, to the
1505.87s - 1534.22s |  point where I just reverted.
1534.22s - 1552.62s |  So this is the three color dispatch being programmed.
1552.62s - 1558.18s |  This is where there was an issue when I was programming it, when, this is me tapping it
1558.18s - 1561.34s |  properly to, you can just, it'll cut.
