**Introduction to Authentication Bypass**

- **Authentication Bypass**: A process to verify a user or a system claiming to be by verifying credentials like usernames, passwords, and digital signatures.
- **Importance**: Crucial for protecting sensitive information in post-login modules.

**Techniques and Vulnerabilities**

- **Session Puzzling**: Exploiting extra permissions on a session ID, allowing access to post-login modules during pre-login.
- **Session Fixation**: Fixing session variables to remain the same, enabling unauthorized access.
- **Access Control Checks**: Using missing controls to perform account takeovers and privilege escalations.
- **Forced Browsing**: Accessing post-authentication modules without credentials due to access control bugs.
- **Host Header Injection**: Hijacking password reset links by manipulating the host header.
- **PHP Type Juggling**: Leveraging PHP's data type conversion to bypass authentication.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**: Exploiting missing CSRF tokens to change user data.
- **HTTP Parameter Pollution**: Manipulating multiple parameters with the same name to interfere with application logic.
- **Response Manipulation**: Altering application responses to bypass authentication processes.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Bypasses**: Breaking OTP validation through integrity checks and reusability.
- **Brute Force and Password Spraying**: Attempting multiple credentials to gain unauthorized access.
- **Default Credentials**: Exploiting common defaults in enterprise products.
- **WordPress User Enumeration**: Using author parameters to gather user information.
- **Insecure Logout Management**: Reusing sessions after logout due to improper session management.

**Practical Application and Case Study**

- **Case Study in Apple**: Demonstrating session puzzling to access post-login modules in a pre-login state.
- **Practical Tips**: Use WPScan with API keys, explore Pastebin and DHash for sensitive information, and leverage Open Bug Bounty for disclosed vulnerabilities.
