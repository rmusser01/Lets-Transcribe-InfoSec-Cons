  "description": "In recent years, we have witnessed a surge in attacks aimed at critical infrastructure, varying widely in scope and impact depending on the region. While the definition of critical infrastructure differs by country, it typically encompasses essential sectors such as oil, natural gas, water, power, and manufacturing. The ramifications of these attacks are complex and often unpredictable.\n\nTo gain a clearer understanding of the state of critical infrastructure globally, starting in 2023, we will annually survey 300 CISOs or security directors across different countries in this sector. We will share the data-driven insights to offer a detailed examination of the current conditions and challenges faced by these crucial systems. By comparing trends across different years, countries, and industries, our goal is to enhance the security and resilience of critical infrastructures worldwide.",

0.85s - 13.53s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 All right, so welcome to Creators Stage 2, 2.30, and I'm Arshad, and I'm honored to be
13.53s - 21.65s |  great here again, on behalf of ICS Village here, and today we are going to present this
21.65s - 28.77s |  talk will be to mapping the landscape for the top 10 critical infrastructure search
28.77s - 39.45s |  terrains here for 2024. And I will say, usually we will meet some situation is we know OT
39.45s - 45.37s |  security is very critical, but we don't know how real critical in a different industry
45.37s - 52.13s |  is very chaos. We know that attacks, we know there are many attacks, ransomware, APT attacks,
52.61s - 60.01s |  what kinds of thinking behind of most OT operator or OT industry CISOs. So we do a lot of
60.01s - 65.85s |  research on that, and we want to know how we can do that. And I'm Mark Chen from Taiwan, and
65.85s - 72.97s |  now I'm the social manager of TS1 Networks, and I also is the executive director of the
72.97s - 76.81s |  Association of Hacks in Taiwan. It's a very awesome and powerful association, and we
76.81s - 81.49s |  organized many cybersecurity conference or competition things, and also spoke at a major
81.73s - 89.61s |  cybersecurity conference. Also, I just finished our talk for yesterday, Brighad USA 2094. So it's
89.61s - 96.97s |  me here for reference. Okay, I think. And also, so for the top 10 critical infrastructure
96.97s - 103.69s |  situation and search terrain here. Before we started, we need to know that one thing first
103.69s - 115.85s |  here is we do this survey for 2023 and 2024. And this survey, we collected many cybersecurity
115.85s - 123.13s |  CISOs in the OT industry, including the 2023 for general manufacturing, in the automotive
123.13s - 129.61s |  manufacturing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, oil and gas. And also, we also do a lot of things in
129.69s - 136.97s |  2024, and we increased it as a scope here. So for the reference, we know now in 2024, we have
136.97s - 143.05s |  more higher percentage for those people in charge of OT cybersecurity and budget and everything,
143.05s - 150.25s |  so on the management level. And first, what is the top 10 for first one for policy? We know every
150.25s - 157.61s |  country everywhere they know the cybersecurity for OT environment is very important. But how
157.61s - 164.49s |  important is it for that? So we just go through from the policy, you will see here from March 2023
164.49s - 171.69s |  to now, there are many policies, sometimes they were related with the OT environment, or ICS
171.69s - 177.77s |  policies, or like for example, in the EU, recently, yes, we have a cyber serious ad happened.
177.77s - 183.77s |  And also in every industry, including Taiwan, Korea, Japan, they also design their some security
183.77s - 189.61s |  law, or the regulation for OT and critical infrastructure environment. So we know the
189.61s - 196.57s |  process is going on that, to know how to process that or that on those environments.
197.53s - 202.57s |  And for people, according to our observation, these very interesting things is, we know the
202.57s - 209.69s |  security awareness and the training of OT operators. Here, we focus on OT operators,
209.69s - 216.33s |  it's very, very not enough. Why we say that? So here's the evidence here. We know there are many
216.33s - 221.77s |  OT security incidents, including phishing email, for the root cause, including phishing email,
221.77s - 227.21s |  or some employee actions, sometimes it will be malicious motivations, or sometimes it will be
227.21s - 234.81s |  unintentional. But here, you will see between 2023 and 2024 here, there is still something different.
235.29s - 243.69s |  For 2023, phishing email, employee actions, they will be the root cause for the OT security
243.69s - 250.97s |  incident. And for the 2024 ransomware attack, and for the mobility patch. But we know the one key
250.97s - 259.85s |  reason is, even in 2024, our answer from those CISOs in the OT environment, the answer
260.65s - 269.13s |  ransomware is their first priority, and the key root cause for the OT security incident.
269.13s - 279.13s |  But let's be aware, one thing is, the thing is, the ransomware attack is not totally performed
279.13s - 288.09s |  by those attackers. Sometimes they also put some hold on the environment issue in the OT industry.
288.09s - 295.13s |  So that's why those attackers can leverage those vulnerabilities, or those issues,
295.13s - 306.09s |  to take over the entire OT environment. So that's why we say the security awareness and training
306.09s - 311.21s |  is not enough for this moment, for those environments here. And for the people,
311.21s - 315.69s |  we also say human resource gap for OT security professionals. Why we say that?
316.25s - 320.17s |  Why we say that? The shortage for the cybersecurity professionals here,
320.17s - 326.97s |  is we focus on many environments here for like, like the integration between IT and OT environment.
327.93s - 332.25s |  So we know the one thing is, in the OT environment, there are many industries,
332.25s - 340.73s |  such as chemical or pharmaceuticals. But the key point is, in a different industry, they have
341.29s - 347.61s |  different OT security professional requirements. However, in this stage, in this moment,
347.61s - 353.05s |  those OT security professionals still have to rely on IT security professionals.
353.05s - 359.37s |  So we will say they are not integrated, they still rely on IT environment. So the real thing is,
359.37s - 366.01s |  those OT guys or those OT security staff, they don't know, those IT people don't know how to
366.81s - 374.01s |  run the real OT cybersecurity things. So that's why we say they lack the OT and IT integration.
380.73s - 386.73s |  And also, the talent gap is also difficult to hire. So for OT security professionals,
386.73s - 393.13s |  for example, if you need to do the OT security in a semiconductor, first thing, you need to know
393.13s - 398.97s |  what kinds of things, semiconductor process, what is the operation for the semiconductor industry,
399.61s - 404.25s |  what is the semiconductor security issue, what are the different things between the
404.25s - 409.53s |  semiconductor or IT environment for cybersecurity for the 3As. So we need to know that. And also,
409.53s - 416.25s |  if we also judge that, and we are hard to hire those professionals for the semiconductor.
416.25s - 421.69s |  So that's why security professionals are not enough here, and also hire high quality people
422.41s - 429.13s |  for the hiring. And in 2024, we also know those security teams, they don't have enough
429.13s - 435.77s |  capabilities to deal with those OT security things and incidents. The things we encounter
435.77s - 442.49s |  and we have from our survey is, those CISOs usually will answer, they need to seek for third-party help
443.29s - 449.45s |  to handle OT security incidents. Their own OT security incidents or IT security teams
449.45s - 455.45s |  are hard to deal with those key incidents in their OT environment. They need to seek help.
455.45s - 461.93s |  So there will be a security professional leakage here. So that's why we need to
461.93s - 469.05s |  try to engage and make the IT and OT security teams to correlate with each other. And we need
469.05s - 473.29s |  to know how to increase the high quality OT security professionals. We need to perform a
473.29s - 478.89s |  kind of training. We need to know the operation process. Some people will say, we don't need to
478.89s - 484.41s |  know the different semiconductor or different industry process we can do the OT cybersecurity.
484.41s - 490.57s |  I will say totally wrong, because their operation is still different in each environment. For chemical,
490.57s - 493.29s |  for pharmaceutical, they have different operations, they have different machines,
494.09s - 500.25s |  they have different parameters or issues on that. So it's very different. And therefore,
500.25s - 504.65s |  there will be more attack factors targeting critical infrastructure and OT than enterprise
504.65s - 511.29s |  environment. So why we say that? I will say the most simplified thing is, OT has more
511.29s - 518.97s |  large scope for attackers. Between the IT and OT, so we will say IT, we don't mention IT here,
518.97s - 523.85s |  but for the OT environment, they have more and more devices on that. They have more and more
523.85s - 530.73s |  operations on that. So they have thousands or hundreds of thousands of devices, operations,
530.73s - 540.01s |  process parameters, or everything on that, more than IT for over 100 times. So nowadays,
540.01s - 545.61s |  the IT and OT are already converging. We say, usually, we will have some proof later,
545.61s - 552.49s |  but we know the IT and OT are already converging. So if I bring those IT operations, OT operations
552.49s - 558.25s |  on the attack surface, we will face those attack factors more than the IT environment here.
559.21s - 565.93s |  So for example, communication protocol. OT environments still use legacy OT communication
565.93s - 572.89s |  protocols, such as Modbus, such as Mailsoft, Mailsec, or different vendor protocols. They
572.89s - 580.73s |  usually are encrypted protocols. They are very high risk. And also, those PLCs, those servers
580.73s - 586.33s |  that are never patched, or even patched, they have more and more applications. So we will say,
586.89s - 592.49s |  those attack factors are higher than the IT environment. So that's why we say that those
592.49s - 598.09s |  attack factors are higher. And also, not only malware, not only insider threat,
598.73s - 606.81s |  the OT environment depends on their features in a different OT environment or industry.
606.81s - 612.17s |  Sometimes they will leverage GPS. For example, some power plants will use GPS to locate their
612.17s - 616.97s |  time, because time accuracy is very important in the power plant and power industry or energy.
617.53s - 622.89s |  Or sometimes for semiconductor, for manufacturing, they are more taking care of third-party and
622.89s - 629.53s |  supply chain threats, because they are already aware those attacks can successfully enter their
629.53s - 634.09s |  environment, basically, from third-party, from supply chain. For semiconductor,
634.73s - 641.45s |  it's a very interesting thing. Usually, they buy devices. These devices may be already
642.25s - 648.49s |  $1 million, $2 million already. But those devices are even expensive. But they are already deployed
648.49s - 654.81s |  in the virus inside the devices before they provide to those semiconductor industries.
655.53s - 661.45s |  So before that, the supply chain also will increase the attack factor on the environment.
661.93s - 670.81s |  And also, 5G security and satellite. Recently, TS1 also noticed a very interesting part is
671.77s - 678.17s |  satellite. And we also do a lot of research on satellite risk. We know nowadays,
678.17s - 683.45s |  in a different industry, they also deploy, and they need to make long-distance issues
683.45s - 690.97s |  to solve the long-distance issue. They need to use the satellite or 5G to solve the connection
690.97s - 696.81s |  problem, communication problem. But however, I will say, unfortunately, those satellite devices
697.53s - 704.57s |  usually are encrypted or are not secure at all after our survey. So we will say,
704.57s - 710.17s |  in a straight landscape or a straight attack surface part, the OT environment is more and
710.17s - 718.41s |  larger than IT environment in this moment. And five, I will say, endless ransomware.
718.41s - 724.89s |  This term may not be targeted by OT environment. But unfortunately, those OT environments,
724.89s - 731.93s |  they have IT environment. And those IT environments, if a server were attacked by ransomware,
731.93s - 738.41s |  usually will impact on OT industry. And we will show the evidence later here.
738.41s - 744.73s |  So for the survey evaluation in 2023, we noticed, and we also raised the issue,
744.73s - 751.45s |  is ransomware still is a major attack in 2023? There are still a lot of attacks or security
751.45s - 758.65s |  incidents in the OT environment or in OT industry related with ransomware. Because those ransomware
758.65s - 766.97s |  will choose a valuable target. Who has money? Who has most powerful money? They will attack
766.97s - 772.89s |  those industries or those companies because they can ransom that more easily. And in fact,
772.89s - 777.21s |  they are right. For manufacturing, for chemical, for the car industry,
777.93s - 782.81s |  automation industry, automotive industry, they are right. They will pay the ransom.
784.65s - 790.89s |  And for the third, I will say IT and OT are highly convergent. Unfortunately,
790.89s - 798.41s |  this highly convergent is very good and also bad. Why good? Because for operators,
798.41s - 803.77s |  they are more easily to operate everything, every process in OT and IT control system.
803.77s - 812.33s |  But what is the bad? The bad is the most OT environment is impacted by IT incidents.
812.41s - 818.57s |  So we can see the table here in 2023. Yes, we have over 143
821.21s - 827.85s |  direct label or above. The answer is they are strongly or suddenly affected by
828.89s - 834.57s |  they have incidents by IT environment, but those incidents also impact on OT environment.
835.29s - 844.09s |  And in 2024, the percentage is increasing a little bit to 97% in total. So the key point,
844.09s - 852.25s |  the key thing is those attacks if impact IT environment almost will impact OT environment
852.25s - 860.09s |  according to our survey. So that will be the bad part for the OT environment nowadays for
860.09s - 867.69s |  our automation here. And also, we also survey and ask our people one question is,
868.73s - 877.05s |  OT security incident in the past 12 months, and we also have 59% people answer say yes,
877.77s - 886.65s |  or not only, but not OT security incident, but also they don't have, but they also don't provide
886.65s - 894.25s |  or don't do any forensics or investigation on that, even they get alert. So main is visibility,
894.25s - 901.69s |  I will say visibility. Those people answer say yes, is they realize, they also notice,
901.69s - 906.41s |  they have system, they monitoring, those incidents happened, they can handle that.
906.97s - 915.37s |  But the one part is, they may not have enough mechanism to monitor, to find the attacker is
915.37s - 921.13s |  ongoing, or already be performed by those attacker. They don't know how. So they don't
921.13s - 926.09s |  have forensics or investigation on that. And so that's why we conduct the answer together to the
926.09s - 934.97s |  95, 59% here. They're very interesting. And also, but this table I will say very interesting,
934.97s - 940.65s |  because it's already a little bit different with our thinking here. So here is where we
940.81s - 947.05s |  real-time recovery for the OT attack remain a challenge here. You will see the major
948.01s - 954.41s |  attackers, such as APT attacks, DDoS attacks, employee actions for human errors, and for
954.41s - 961.29s |  employee actions here, malicious intention, usually they need to use one day to one week
961.29s - 968.49s |  to recover their environment. But if you see the virus, if you see a third-party vendor,
968.49s - 975.69s |  they need to take care for almost five minutes to one hour, or just real-time.
976.25s - 980.81s |  It's a very interesting part, but we still carry out, we still figure out why they answer this
980.81s - 987.93s |  question. And also, currently surveyed, we still try to understand why those CISO can show the
987.93s - 995.05s |  real-time recovery from here, this table. We still try to know why for this.
997.26s - 1003.10s |  And for third-party, it's a huge impact on critical infrastructure. We always say,
1003.10s - 1011.34s |  well, OT is very important. They are very critical. There are many money, but here is
1012.14s - 1019.58s |  our survey to show the proof, say, according to those directors, labor people from a different
1019.58s - 1025.90s |  manufacturing industry. In this question, in this survey, they can answer the three
1026.94s - 1032.30s |  questions, they can choose the three answers for the most concerning part of a security incident.
1032.30s - 1037.66s |  And they are worried about, they also, some people on the survey, they already encounter
1037.66s - 1046.06s |  a lot of attacks. They're also afraid for the compromised operational functions or productivity
1046.06s - 1052.14s |  loss. You will see that including Germany, including USA, including basically in total,
1052.14s - 1057.74s |  they are afraid on that. They know those cybersecurity events will make a huge impact,
1057.74s - 1064.46s |  and some of them have happened before. And also, they're also afraid for the key point,
1064.46s - 1071.34s |  since it's a loss of operation control and safety issues in Japan. And Japan is also very
1071.50s - 1075.74s |  worried about that. So I would say different countries still have a little different situation.
1075.74s - 1080.94s |  Because of this survey, we deal with Germany, we deal with USA, we deal with Japan, or UAE,
1080.94s - 1085.10s |  and including Taiwan. But I'm not raising Taiwan's situation here, because Taiwan's situation is very,
1085.10s - 1092.46s |  very special here. So you will see in 2024, reputation damage, revenue losses,
1093.18s - 1100.54s |  can be raised for the answer. For those CISOs, they are more taking care for the reputation,
1101.10s - 1109.34s |  and revenue, than in 2023. This is a very interesting part. But back to the worries,
1109.34s - 1115.66s |  the key point highlight is they really worry about those security attacks and cybersecurity attacks
1115.66s - 1121.90s |  will impact their productivity, or their operation and realities. They're just afraid of that.
1122.62s - 1132.46s |  And also, in the average, they also try to do a draw, or survey, or planning on that. So they
1132.46s - 1139.58s |  want to evaluate if those cybersecurity attacks happened, how many lost in their OT environment?
1140.62s - 1148.86s |  How many? So they also do a survey. So on average, you will see 100k here,
1149.82s - 1156.30s |  to the 15k here, will be the major part for the 21%. In general, they were afraid of that.
1157.10s - 1161.10s |  But according to our survey, internally, enough survey to those CISO people,
1161.82s - 1170.70s |  a little more highlight on that. Because in a real war, if the one operation loses,
1172.70s - 1177.10s |  is dropped, or shut down, according to our survey, or our real experience,
1177.10s - 1184.54s |  those factories usually will be lost, maybe 200 million, or above, in a key industry,
1184.54s - 1191.50s |  in a major manufacturing. But most people's answer is, they usually between 100k to 15k here,
1191.50s - 1201.66s |  in 2024. And also, in Japan, they are a little higher than other countries. They usually target
1201.66s - 1208.14s |  300k here, the level, they are just afraid they are lost. But in Japan, our target mainly
1208.14s - 1213.82s |  focus on the manufacturing, for general manufacturing here. And also, for number A,
1213.82s - 1220.78s |  will be enterprise are aware of cybersecurity, of OT, and constrain their strategy from perspective
1220.78s - 1230.30s |  here. So why we say that? The most important thing is the budget. So in 2023, 76% of people's
1230.30s - 1238.86s |  answers say they will increase their budget. In 2024, 68% here. But Japan, they decrease
1239.66s - 1245.90s |  their budget for the OT cybersecurity. And the people answer this question for 102.
1246.70s - 1255.74s |  102 people, so mainly 102 companies in Japan, answers they will decrease their cybersecurity
1255.74s - 1262.70s |  budget in the 2024 area. So the importance will be different from a different country perspective
1262.70s - 1271.34s |  here. And solution. Solution is very interesting part, because they already deployed solution
1271.34s - 1275.42s |  cannot solve the problem practically. Why we say that? But interesting part is,
1275.42s - 1281.74s |  93 companies already deployed a cybersecurity solution in their OT environment, according to
1282.70s - 1288.94s |  the answer we get. And also, they also deploy for network solution or endpoint solution in
1288.94s - 1296.06s |  a major part. But however, and also they need to run a POC or they need to improve their product,
1296.06s - 1303.66s |  we've chosen a product from three to six months on average. But why we say that?
1304.46s - 1311.18s |  It's still not good. Why? Because they usually deploy, they usually use IT cybersecurity
1311.18s - 1318.46s |  solution in their environment, not OT specific. This will be different. For example,
1320.62s - 1328.86s |  if IT solution, they usually use heavy memory usage or they don't care BSOD situation in their
1328.86s - 1335.02s |  product. But in OT specific environment, they usually put operation as a first priority.
1335.58s - 1340.94s |  This will be key difference between IT and OT cybersecurity issue. And also,
1340.94s - 1350.62s |  the main power is still not enough for an OT environment. For 26% staff, only one staff for
1351.42s - 1355.58s |  over 200 devices. They need to take care. It's a very heavy things.
1356.38s - 1361.98s |  And also, it's a lot for the number nine here is the unprotected Windows devices in
1361.98s - 1370.22s |  OT environment are common. Why? Why we have number 10? In the number nine, we say they deploy,
1370.22s - 1377.58s |  we already have 93% company or answers, they deploy their cybersecurity solution in OT environment.
1377.58s - 1389.82s |  But the deploy coverage is not 100%. So you will see only 61% organization still have
1390.86s - 1396.94s |  unprotected Windows devices in their environment, no matter when endpoint solution or network
1396.94s - 1403.02s |  solution. In 2024, 77% because Windows 7 also including Windows 10 also including
1403.82s - 1408.86s |  in the legacy Windows devices. So here is the interesting part is,
1408.86s - 1412.94s |  even they say they already deploy cybersecurity solution in their OT environment,
1412.94s - 1419.90s |  but the answer is they are not 100% deploy in their OT environment. So their protection still
1419.90s - 1426.86s |  not enough, according to our survey for the answer here. So I know there's a very quick part is,
1428.46s - 1432.70s |  we will say the organizations in a different industry, they need to prioritize
1432.94s - 1439.74s |  OT proactive defense strategy. We need to take care many, too many things in their environment,
1439.74s - 1444.54s |  including supply chain, asset expansion, straight intelligence, no experimentation,
1444.54s - 1448.38s |  they need to take care because they encountered too many attacks surface
1448.38s - 1455.50s |  on their OT environment. But they need to evaluate what kinds of risks is their first priority here
1456.06s - 1462.38s |  in their OT environment, and they need to take care of that. So this will be the 2024 part we
1462.86s - 1467.50s |  take care for the environment here. So I think it will be all over on my presentation.
1467.50s - 1472.30s |  And if you have any questions, you can go to the stage, I will answer you. Thank you.
