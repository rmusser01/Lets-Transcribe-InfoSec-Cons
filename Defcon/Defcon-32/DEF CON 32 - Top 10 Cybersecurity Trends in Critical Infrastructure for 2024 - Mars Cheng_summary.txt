**Introduction to Cybersecurity Trends in Critical Infrastructure**

- Surge in attacks on **critical infrastructure** in recent years
- Definition varies by country but includes sectors like **oil, natural gas, water, power, and manufacturing**
- Aim to enhance the **security and resilience** of these infrastructures by comparing trends across years and regions

**Survey and Research Approach**

- Annual survey starting in **2023** of 300 **CISOs** or security directors
- Focus on **OT security** and industry-specific challenges
- Increased focus in **2024** on management-level insights and cybersecurity priorities

**Key Findings on Policy and Awareness**

- Importance of **cybersecurity** for **OT environments** recognized globally
- Policies related to OT security are evolving in regions like the **EU, Taiwan, Korea, and Japan**
- **Security awareness** and training for **OT operators** are insufficient

**Challenges in OT Security**

- **Phishing emails** and **employee actions** identified as major **root causes** of security incidents
- **Ransomware** remains a significant threat, with a focus on **vulnerability management**
- **Human resource gaps** in OT security professionals persist, requiring reliance on IT security professionals
- Lack of integration between **IT and OT** environments

**Technology and Threat Landscape**

- **OT environments** have a larger attack surface due to numerous devices and operations
- Use of legacy **communication protocols** like **Modbus** increases risk
- **Supply chain threats** and **third-party vulnerabilities** are significant concerns
- Emerging threats from **5G** and **satellite** technologies

**Impact and Response to Attacks**

- **Ransomware** continues to target industries with valuable assets
- **IT and OT convergence** leads to shared vulnerabilities and increased risk
- **Visibility and forensics** capabilities are lacking in many organizations
- **Real-time recovery** from attacks remains a challenge

**Country-Specific Concerns and Budgetary Trends**

- Different industries and countries have varied concerns, such as **productivity loss** and **safety issues**
- Japan shows a decrease in budget allocation for OT cybersecurity, while other regions increase spending
- Importance of deploying **OT-specific solutions** rather than relying solely on IT solutions

**Conclusion and Recommendations**

- Organizations need to prioritize a **proactive defense strategy** in OT environments
- Emphasize **supply chain security**, **asset management**, and **threat intelligence**
- Evaluate and address the most critical risks specific to their **OT environments**.
