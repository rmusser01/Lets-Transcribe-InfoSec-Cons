**Introduction**
- **DEF CON 32 Talk**: Warflying in a Cessna by Sean McKeever and Matt Thomassen
- **Sean McKeever**: Senior security researcher from Metro Detroit
- **Matt Thomassen**: Works in security, commercial pilot, licensed mechanic
- **Opinions**: Expressed are personal and not related to employers
- **Idea Origin**: November 2019, inspired by DEF CON, decided to explore warflying

**Warflying Concept**
- **Definition**: Similar to war driving, involves locating wireless access points from the air
- **Aircraft Used**: Cessna 182, four-seater, high wing for better visibility
- **Performance**: 230-horsepower engine, cruises at 150 mph, 5 hours fuel reserve

**Disclaimers and Legal Considerations**
- **Not Legal Advice**: Presenters are not lawyers
- **Not Flight Instruction**: Presenters are not flight instructors
- **Acknowledgment**: Thanks to war driving community and RF Hackers Village

**Why Warflying?**
- **Line of Sight**: Advantage in detecting wireless signals
- **Curiosity**: Interest in exploring aircraft and RF interaction

**Safety and Team Dynamics**
- **Safety Emphasis**: Aviate, navigate, communicate—pilot’s primary duties
- **Team Approach**: Warflying safer in teams, but possible solo with caution

**Regulations and Airspace**
- **FAA Regulations**: Responsibility of aircraft operator to ensure no interference
- **Pilot’s Authority**: Pilot’s word is law on safety
- **Airspace Knowledge**: Awareness of Class Bravo and Class Delta airspaces

**Flight Details and Data Collection**
- **Flight Strategy**: Series of test flights, using Google Pixel with Wiggle app
- **Altitude Considerations**: Observations from 1,000 to 3,000 feet
- **Initial Findings**: Large amount of data, more than expected

**Test Flights and Observations**
- **First Flight**: 2,822 unique BSS IDs in 32 minutes
- **Second Flight**: Solo warflying trial, collected data safely
- **Subsequent Tests**: Used multiple devices, experimented with altitude and speed effects

**Data Analysis and Results**
- **Data Formats**: Wiggle’s KML and CSV outputs
- **Distance Analysis**: Detected signals up to several kilometers away
- **Performance Metrics**: Compared max per minute rates across tests

**Challenges and Future Exploration**
- **Technical Challenges**: Impact of speed, altitude, and aircraft construction on data
- **Future Research**: Interest in using drones, composite aircraft, and directional antennas

**Conclusion and Acknowledgments**
- **Thanks**: To air traffic control and others for cooperation
- **War Driving vs. War Flying**: Trade-offs in data quantity vs. speed of collection
