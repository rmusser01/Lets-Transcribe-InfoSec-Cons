**Introduction to Ecovacs Hacking**

- **Speakers Introduction**: 
  - Dennis: Security researcher and hardware hacker focused on wireless and embedded security.
  - Braylin: Works with Leviathan Security Group, focuses on application security and APIs, started robot hacking during COVID.

- **Talk Goals**: 
  - Understand security and privacy risks of **IoT devices**.
  - Overview of vacuum robot hacking and vulnerabilities.
  - Aim to gain **root access** without disassembling the device.

**Motivation for Hacking**

- **Reasons for Rooting Devices**: 
  - Play with cool hardware and stop devices from phoning home.
  - Use smart home automation systems like **Home Assistant**.
  - Verify privacy claims of vendors and understand the **rate to repair**.

**Ecovacs Ecosystem and Hardware**

- **Company Background**: 
  - Founded in **1998 in China**, started with OEM vacuum cleaners.
  - Market share of **17% in 2020**, second to iRobot.

- **Hardware Overview**: 
  - Typically features a **SoC running Linux** for navigation, mapping, and connectivity.
  - Equipped with various sensors: LiDAR, cameras, microphones, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Ultra Wideband.

- **Specific Models Discussed**: 
  - **D-Bot 900 series**: Early generation with basic specs.
  - **X1 and X2**: More advanced with quad-core ARM Cortex and AI acceleration.
  - **AirBot Z1**: Similar to X1, with additional cameras and microphones for enhanced features like home patrol.

**Software and Security**

- **Software Details**: 
  - Runs **Linux OS**, uses **ROS** for robotics, and has a custom suite called Medusa.
  - Utilizes **AWS Kinesis SDK** and **Alibaba Aliyun SDK** for remote camera access.

- **AI Models**: 
  - Uses **TensorFlow** and **OpenCV** for object detection including furniture and pets.

- **Security Concerns**: 
  - **TLS Misconfiguration**: Some devices accept self-signed certificates, posing security risks.
  - **Pin Protection**: Client-based, vulnerable to tampering and does not log successful authentications.

**Data Privacy and Vulnerabilities**

- **Data Harvesting**: 
  - Collection of telemetry data, including robot location and Wi-Fi access points.
  - Storing maps and pictures in a **NoSQL database** without access controls.

- **Live Video and Audio Access**: 
  - AWS Kinesis used for sessions, but pin verification can be bypassed.

- **Anti-Theft Mechanisms**: 
  - ECOVACs G1 lawnmower uses a pin stored in plain text, vulnerable to theft.

**Hacking Techniques and Methods**

- **Bluetooth Remote Code Execution**: 
  - Exploit in **BLE** for provisioning and remote control, allowing command execution as root.

- **Firmware and Rooting**: 
  - Firmware updates are encrypted but not signed, allowing for potential exploitation.
  - **Root access** achievable through UART, with passwords generated from serial numbers.

**Concluding Remarks**

- **Security Recommendations**: 
  - Turn off vulnerable devices until patches are available.
  - Avoid connecting to insecure networks like DEF CON Open.
  - Be cautious with used devices as they might have compromised firmware.

- **Overall Findings**: 
  - Root access on most Ecovacs robots, with various security and privacy vulnerabilities identified.
