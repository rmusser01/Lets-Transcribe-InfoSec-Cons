- **Introduction**:
    - Speaker expresses gratitude for the opportunity to present at **DEF CON** for the second time.
    - Acknowledges the support of colleagues from the **P2P team**.
    - Provides a brief overview of their professional background, including experience in **OT** and **cybersecurity**.
- **Main Engines**:
    - A typical **container ship** engine is supported by ancillary systems like pumps for cooling and fuel injection.
    - These systems are controlled by **redundant arrays** of generators, ensuring **power steering**.
    - The **power management system (PMS)** and **integrated alarm and monitoring system** play crucial roles in managing these components.
- **Steering Controls**:
    - The **helm**, **steering gear**, and **steering flat** allow for manual control of the ship in emergency situations.
    - The **autopilot** can connect directly to the engine, but it can also be disconnected for manual steering.
    - The presence of a **physical switch** to disconnect the autopilot is highlighted as an important safety feature.
- **Power Outages on Ships**:
    - Blackouts can occur due to various factors such as bad fuel, heavy seas, electrical problems, or poor maintenance.
    - In the event of a blackout, restarting procedures may involve a series of steps, including manual management of the system.
    - The time taken to restore power can vary, and even a short delay can have significant consequences if the ship is approaching a bridge or built-up area.
- **Autopilot Threat Landscape**:
    - While direct connections to the internet are rare, firmware downloads and updates can introduce potential vulnerabilities.
    - The speaker discusses the possibility of a **supply chain attack** but considers it unlikely due to the required effort and the need to compromise firmware suppliers.
- **Propulsion and Power Systems**:
    - Propulsion systems are rarely connected to the internet and are physically isolated, making attacks unlikely.
    - Power systems, on the other hand, are frequently network-connected, but attacks are still considered unlikely due to manual override capabilities.
    - The recurring theme is the presence of a **human-in-the-loop**, ensuring that someone is always in control of the ship.
- **Conclusion on Ship Hacking**:
    - While it is possible to hack a ship, it requires significant time and effort, including extensive social engineering.
    - The speaker refutes the claim that the **MV Dali** was hacked, stating that it is highly improbable due to the time, knowledge, and access required.
    - Polarized views and commentary from uninformed sources can be misleading, and a deep understanding of ship architecture is necessary for accurate assessments.
- **Recap of Previous Presentation**:
    - The speaker provides a brief overview of the systems discussed in their previous presentation, including the **integrated control and monitoring system (ICMS)**, **charting system**, and **safety management system**.
    - They emphasize the importance of these systems for the safe operation of a ship and their potential appeal as targets for attackers.
- **IT/OT System on Ships**:
    - The speaker presents an idealized version of the IT/OT system on a ship, showing the separation of networks and the use of VLAN trunks and cabin switches.
    - However, they also acknowledge that the real-world implementation can be messier, with RDP and Cisco equipment playing a significant role.
- **Propulsion System and Network Complexity**:
    - The speaker discusses the use of **Azipod** propulsion systems, which can be controlled independently and wirelessly via Wi-Fi.
    - The complexity of ship networks, with pipes, cables, and unknown systems, is highlighted, making it challenging to identify and secure all potential vulnerabilities.
- **Discovery of a Rugged PC**:
    - The speaker recounts finding a Windows-based PC connected to the fuel consumption monitoring system, with an IP-to-serial connector.
    - Further investigation revealed a transmit-only serial connection to the bridge and a Modbus connection to the PLCs, providing potential attack vectors.
- **TeamViewer Discovery**:
    - The PC was also found to have TeamViewer installed, even though the company had stopped paying for the service four years prior.
    - This outdated and unupdated software presented a potential entry point for attackers, highlighting the risks associated with converging and modernizing ship systems.
- **Social Engineering and Undocumented Access Points**:
    - The speaker emphasizes that hacking a ship remotely is highly unlikely, but social engineering and physical presence onboard can be significant factors.
    - They also mention the discovery of multiple undocumented access points during ship testing, underscoring the need for comprehensive security assessments.
- **Final Thoughts**:
    - Ships can be hacked, but it requires time, presence, and a combination of technical and social engineering skills.
    - The speaker concludes by reiterating the importance of understanding ship architecture and the potential risks introduced by converging and modernizing systems.
