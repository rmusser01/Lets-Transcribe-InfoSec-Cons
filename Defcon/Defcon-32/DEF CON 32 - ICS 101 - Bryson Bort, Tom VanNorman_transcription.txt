0.00s - 2.88s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 I'm Grayson Bort, I'm the founder of Scythe,
2.88s - 6.56s |  the founder of Grimm, and the co-founder of the ICS Village.
6.56s - 9.36s |  I'm Tommy Norman, co-founder of ICS Village
9.36s - 11.64s |  and a senior VP at Grimm.
11.64s - 15.58s |  So we run a village down there on industrial control systems
15.58s - 17.60s |  so if you wanna get some hands-on experience,
17.60s - 20.20s |  which we're gonna just quickly kinda give a high level on,
20.20s - 23.12s |  please come on down, we can fuck up shit together.
23.12s - 25.30s |  And the best part about it, since it's not production,
25.30s - 27.96s |  we all know what it's like to not test in Prague, right?
27.96s - 31.42s |  You can poison a fake water supply.
32.56s - 33.40s |  Okay.
33.40s - 35.04s |  Oh, mics?
35.04s - 36.24s |  Do I need a mic?
36.24s - 38.36s |  Or is it for recording?
38.36s - 39.20s |  Yes.
40.64s - 41.64s |  It's fine.
43.60s - 46.28s |  All right, so let's talk industrial control systems.
46.28s - 48.68s |  Who knows what an industrial control system is?
49.66s - 60.86s |  What's an industrial control system?
60.86s - 65.45s |  Imagine that, what a good nerd answer.
65.45s - 67.55s |  Any computer that's at least 20 years old.
69.65s - 73.61s |  Also correct.
73.61s - 76.85s |  No, but so why is that important to understand, right?
76.85s - 79.21s |  Most of us, it's easy to learn
79.21s - 80.37s |  about information technology.
80.37s - 82.45s |  This is part of why we wanted to put this talk together
82.45s - 85.65s |  is because getting into industrial control systems
85.65s - 87.85s |  isn't just something you can walk down to Best Buy
87.85s - 92.85s |  and ask for a HMI or a DCS or any of those things.
94.05s - 94.93s |  You're not gonna be able to do it.
94.93s - 97.85s |  Now, strangely, you can buy them all on eBay.
97.85s - 99.21s |  We're gonna get to that, right?
99.21s - 102.83s |  So it's more of this like obfuscated, obtuse discipline
102.83s - 106.17s |  that it's like, I'm interested, but how do I get to it?
106.17s - 107.41s |  And so that's why, yeah, exactly.
107.41s - 109.01s |  That's why we're talking about it today.
109.01s - 111.35s |  So that joke, when we go back to industrial control systems
111.35s - 112.77s |  already sets the condition,
112.77s - 115.77s |  how it's so different than information technology, right?
115.77s - 118.77s |  You're trained to buy a phone every two years.
118.77s - 121.33s |  Your laptop has a problem, you patch it,
121.33s - 122.69s |  you buy a new one, right?
122.69s - 124.13s |  It's not expensive, it's easy to do.
124.13s - 125.69s |  You're used to doing that.
125.69s - 127.13s |  In the industrial control system environment,
127.45s - 129.65s |  these things are not built on confidentiality,
129.65s - 130.93s |  integrity, and availability,
130.93s - 134.01s |  which are the security principles you've been taught in IT.
134.01s - 137.15s |  It's built on resilience and availability.
138.69s - 141.09s |  Because what happens when water's not available?
142.31s - 144.57s |  You wanna give a nerd answer to that?
144.57s - 145.41s |  Bad shit.
146.57s - 148.69s |  Bad shit happens, right?
148.69s - 150.79s |  So this is a completely different world
150.79s - 152.29s |  with a completely different impact.
152.29s - 153.73s |  Here's the good news.
153.73s - 155.47s |  It's not as hard as it sounds.
156.47s - 158.83s |  So we're gonna talk through some of those pieces
158.83s - 160.59s |  and we're gonna explain, kind of give you an idea
160.59s - 164.43s |  of how the architecture works, how threats work.
164.43s - 166.59s |  And then we're gonna talk through some specific examples
166.59s - 168.67s |  of how you can start to build your own lab
168.67s - 170.27s |  and learn some of those things.
170.27s - 171.63s |  And you wanna try?
171.63s - 174.27s |  So the one thing that I always talk about
174.27s - 175.67s |  with industrial control systems,
175.67s - 179.03s |  why or how are they different than IT,
179.03s - 181.35s |  other than being really old?
181.35s - 182.47s |  Health, life, and safety.
182.47s - 183.55s |  Those are the three things, right?
183.67s - 186.19s |  Your email goes out, what happens?
186.19s - 187.87s |  You have a quiet day, right?
187.87s - 190.91s |  Your website goes down, you lose money, it's a bad day.
190.91s - 193.77s |  Amazon, Delta we saw, bad day.
195.25s - 198.07s |  Those controllers go down and your grid turns off
198.07s - 200.37s |  or your water plant turns off.
200.37s - 202.35s |  That's health, life, and safety.
202.35s - 205.91s |  So those are the three things that I always go back to
205.91s - 207.71s |  when we talk about control systems.
207.71s - 209.53s |  IT, you can turn that stuff off.
209.53s - 211.51s |  You'll have a bad day, you'll have a quiet day.
211.51s - 212.43s |  You're not gonna kill people.
212.43s - 213.59s |  You're not gonna pollute the environment.
213.59s - 217.59s |  You're not gonna destroy things and hurt people.
217.59s - 218.75s |  Way to bring us down, man.
218.75s - 220.27s |  I know, how about it?
220.27s - 222.27s |  You made me run all the way downstairs up to here
222.27s - 223.27s |  and we were lost.
224.39s - 225.79s |  We were lost for five minutes.
225.79s - 228.83s |  We could not figure out where this place was.
228.83s - 230.03s |  So here's the good news.
230.03s - 231.43s |  This is why it's easier.
231.43s - 232.95s |  Besides the fact that everything is older
232.95s - 234.27s |  and actually much simpler.
235.51s - 238.52s |  Forgot my point.
240.16s - 242.96s |  Been here seven days and blackout was really long, okay?
243.84s - 246.88s |  Is there's a physical effect, right?
246.88s - 249.12s |  Hey, I pop shell, I have an interpreter session.
249.12s - 251.40s |  Okay, hey, data got lost.
251.40s - 252.24s |  What does that mean?
252.24s - 253.84s |  How do I feel that?
253.84s - 255.08s |  With industrial control systems,
255.08s - 257.92s |  there is a physical change in the world, right?
257.92s - 261.48s |  The lights go off, the light bulb goes on, right?
261.48s - 264.44s |  We're not popping calc.exe in a Windows box.
264.44s - 266.68s |  You're actually seeing something change.
266.68s - 269.12s |  So there's a lot more of that physical feedback loop
269.12s - 269.96s |  on the learning.
269.96s - 270.80s |  So how is it set up?
270.80s - 272.40s |  Who's heard of the Purdue model?
273.28s - 274.32s |  We've got some hands, all right.
274.32s - 275.24s |  We've got ringers.
276.96s - 278.16s |  What's the Purdue model?
280.52s - 281.56s |  There are no experts.
293.52s - 295.20s |  Data segmentation, data flow.
299.68s - 302.56s |  So I meant the words that are the correct answer.
303.52s - 304.36s |  No, you got it.
304.36s - 306.64s |  So it is a nominal enterprise architecture
306.64s - 308.32s |  and it breaks down five levels.
308.32s - 310.20s |  The first you all know, IT.
310.20s - 311.84s |  And IT is just one box.
311.84s - 313.64s |  And then there is always,
313.64s - 316.04s |  I want you to all repeat with me, an air gap.
317.40s - 319.44s |  It's not an air gap.
319.44s - 320.52s |  Is not an air gap.
321.64s - 324.32s |  Your IT will always talk to your OT.
324.32s - 325.72s |  And there's a lot of reasons for that.
325.72s - 327.48s |  I've always had, I always love it when there's some nerd
327.48s - 328.60s |  who's like, well, actually,
328.60s - 330.84s |  have you ever like been in a nuclear power plant?
330.84s - 332.48s |  I'm like, yep, that air gap is never pure.
333.48s - 334.96s |  There's a reason, okay.
334.96s - 336.64s |  So let's just understand that.
336.64s - 339.44s |  Next level up is your DMZ.
339.44s - 341.48s |  So you need shared service functions
341.48s - 344.32s |  because there's still some level of IT functionality.
344.32s - 345.72s |  There's centralized management
345.72s - 347.64s |  that we need to be running these things.
347.64s - 349.92s |  So that's your high level industrial control systems.
349.92s - 352.28s |  Then we start breaking down into what are called,
352.28s - 353.88s |  specific control zones.
353.88s - 356.12s |  And so that's basically two, one, zero.
356.12s - 357.80s |  And that's where we have this combination
357.80s - 359.80s |  of engineering workstations,
359.80s - 361.44s |  programmable logic controllers,
361.88s - 365.16s |  the things that are actually making a process do a thing.
365.16s - 366.84s |  Again, going back to my original point,
366.84s - 368.84s |  that process has an output.
368.84s - 370.52s |  That's the cool part about this.
370.52s - 373.68s |  Those subsystems are outputting something.
373.68s - 375.76s |  And so the purpose of the Purdue model
375.76s - 377.68s |  is understanding that segmentation
377.68s - 379.28s |  and then learning how to design
379.28s - 381.56s |  what are called control zones and conduits.
381.56s - 382.96s |  How do I create segmentation
382.96s - 385.92s |  so that if there's an issue on this output over here
385.92s - 387.80s |  that is spitting out this widget,
387.80s - 389.72s |  it doesn't impact something over here.
390.52s - 392.16s |  And then the conduits are my way
392.16s - 394.04s |  of driving still the information,
394.04s - 396.12s |  the data flow that I need to have between them.
396.12s - 397.88s |  Now, here's the problem.
397.88s - 400.12s |  I just said five levels of something.
400.12s - 404.29s |  Doesn't that just feel like defense in depth?
404.29s - 405.57s |  Yes.
405.57s - 406.41s |  Yes.
408.13s - 410.41s |  You were shaking no, because you knew where I was going.
410.41s - 412.17s |  The correct answer is in fact, yes.
412.17s - 414.85s |  There are no trick questions, just dumb answers.
417.57s - 420.82s |  Glad you all get my sense of humor.
421.14s - 423.18s |  So the point is that all collapses
423.18s - 425.94s |  into what we really see from the threat perspective.
425.94s - 427.78s |  So there's basically two ways.
427.78s - 429.38s |  Well, there's actually five ways in,
429.38s - 431.74s |  but we're gonna simplify it to the two common.
431.74s - 433.30s |  The one which you probably hear the most
433.30s - 435.42s |  and gets the most press play is,
435.42s - 437.90s |  oh my gosh, my operational technology devices
437.90s - 439.58s |  are directly connected to the internet.
439.58s - 441.62s |  Look at what Shodan or Census turned up.
444.14s - 445.78s |  Yeah, it happens,
445.78s - 448.26s |  but it's not the most common access vector.
448.26s - 450.50s |  The most common access vector is what you see
451.18s - 453.58s |  in most of your daily enterprise IT lives,
453.58s - 457.42s |  because IT is the big squishy thing on the internet.
457.42s - 459.26s |  That's its entire purpose.
459.26s - 461.26s |  And I'm not gonna guess you're all model employees.
461.26s - 463.26s |  So you're not just surfing the web
463.26s - 468.34s |  instead of doing your jobs.
468.34s - 469.18s |  Take the credit.
469.18s - 472.14s |  That's about the nicest thing I'm gonna say to you all day.
472.14s - 474.30s |  We can go back to Dr. Doom here if you want.
477.66s - 480.22s |  So all of those tactics that you see in IT
480.22s - 482.42s |  are the same ones that we have to worry about.
482.46s - 484.50s |  They come in, they pivot, they move,
484.50s - 486.34s |  and again, because an air gap is not an air gap
486.34s - 488.86s |  is not an air gap, I cross over.
488.86s - 491.46s |  Now, we still have three to four levels,
491.46s - 493.62s |  actually four levels on that side,
493.62s - 495.22s |  but here's where they all collapse.
495.22s - 498.30s |  So you're all aware of the gloom and doom cyber weapons.
498.30s - 499.94s |  We know about Indestroyer, Indestroyer 2,
499.94s - 502.42s |  we've seen the Russian military using in Ukraine.
502.42s - 505.02s |  That's not the thing we have to worry about most.
505.02s - 507.54s |  The same way that PowerShell pretty much defines
507.54s - 513.92s |  what happens in IT, same thing in OT.
513.92s - 515.00s |  It's the living off the land,
515.00s - 517.60s |  taking over those high-level industrial control systems,
517.60s - 520.24s |  they tell everything else what to do.
520.24s - 522.44s |  So now we've anchored how this works,
522.44s - 523.76s |  what we got to worry about.
523.76s - 526.24s |  Now let's talk about how we start to teach ourselves.
527.36s - 528.20s |  Labs.
528.20s - 532.44s |  So if anybody has not been in the ISS Village downstairs,
532.44s - 534.28s |  back in the corner, please stop by.
534.28s - 537.48s |  We'll show you what we have, our hands on demos.
537.48s - 538.80s |  Yes, we know where that is.
538.80s - 540.72s |  And it's far, but not that far.
541.64s - 543.44s |  It's not in another building, right?
543.44s - 546.24s |  So how do we build these systems?
546.24s - 548.88s |  How do we build in an environment where we can train?
548.88s - 551.52s |  We can see if our patches work.
551.52s - 552.64s |  That's a really important one.
552.64s - 554.32s |  Never patch production, right?
556.12s - 557.88s |  Live anyway, you want to patch production,
557.88s - 560.32s |  but you want to test those patches before you push it out
560.32s - 562.68s |  or things happen.
562.68s - 563.64s |  How do we do that?
563.64s - 567.88s |  Well, with ICS Village and my day job and all that,
567.88s - 569.16s |  we build these systems out.
569.16s - 571.36s |  So what we've been doing,
572.28s - 574.08s |  we don't use virtualized systems,
574.08s - 578.16s |  but we'll use virtualized systems when it should be used,
578.16s - 579.92s |  such as HMIs and things like that, right?
579.92s - 580.76s |  They're all virtualized.
580.76s - 583.00s |  They're just window assets.
583.00s - 586.20s |  When we get down to controllers,
587.16s - 589.08s |  we're using the real ones, right?
589.08s - 590.24s |  We're not using Raspberry Pi.
590.24s - 592.24s |  Sure, you can use OpenPLC, you can do all these other ones.
592.24s - 594.40s |  But the reason why we're not doing that downstairs
594.40s - 598.48s |  in ICS Village is they just don't work the same.
598.48s - 601.36s |  So when you go out and you want to learn
601.36s - 602.28s |  how these systems work,
602.28s - 603.88s |  whether you're interested in the control system
603.88s - 604.72s |  to get a job in it,
604.72s - 608.32s |  or you're a working practitioner or professional now in it,
608.32s - 609.56s |  how do you do this?
610.52s - 611.56s |  We source stuff from eBay.
611.56s - 613.04s |  We source stuff from our vendors.
613.04s - 615.92s |  We get stuff donated to us, but-
615.92s - 617.24s |  How can I buy something from eBay?
617.24s - 619.04s |  How would I make that work for home?
621.08s - 624.32s |  So I wouldn't recommend that, actually.
627.28s - 629.04s |  The problem is that we run into,
629.04s - 630.48s |  you buy that thing from eBay.
630.48s - 631.64s |  Well, great, now you need a license.
631.64s - 632.48s |  Now you need a key.
632.48s - 633.32s |  Now you need that thing.
633.32s - 634.16s |  You need that thing.
634.16s - 635.08s |  You need that cable, all that stuff.
635.08s - 636.60s |  That stuff's not trivial.
636.60s - 639.00s |  Once you're using it, yes, now you understand.
639.00s - 641.96s |  But for somebody to take that thing from,
641.96s - 643.44s |  you know, that Allen Bradley controller
643.44s - 646.84s |  from eBay that you bought for 150 bucks,
646.84s - 647.96s |  well, where's the cable?
647.96s - 648.84s |  Where's the license?
648.84s - 649.68s |  Where's that?
649.68s - 651.64s |  So that gets quite difficult.
651.64s - 653.40s |  Come volunteer for ICS Village.
653.40s - 655.60s |  We'll show you how to do that stuff.
655.60s - 658.48s |  We can get you connected with different universities,
658.80s - 661.36s |  colleges, learning institutions.
661.36s - 663.00s |  I'll show you how to do that.
664.24s - 667.56s |  One of the things that we're constantly saying
667.56s - 668.96s |  to people when they come up, they're saying,
668.96s - 671.00s |  hey, where do I start?
671.00s - 671.92s |  What do I do?
673.52s - 675.04s |  We're looking at authentication.
675.04s - 676.72s |  We're looking at segmentation.
676.72s - 679.36s |  We're looking at knowing what's on your network.
679.36s - 681.52s |  Well, what does that even mean?
681.52s - 683.80s |  So, you know, whether you're gonna walk down
683.80s - 686.56s |  your plant floor, whether you're gonna take PCAPs,
686.56s - 687.48s |  whether you're gonna do something,
687.48s - 688.36s |  know what's on your network.
689.24s - 691.20s |  Your asset detection, authentication.
691.20s - 693.40s |  Don't leave everything admin, admin.
693.40s - 696.40s |  However, that's a legitimate thing now.
696.40s - 699.32s |  You go into that, you know, nuclear plant
699.32s - 701.12s |  like Price just talked about here.
701.12s - 702.44s |  Well, you have guard gates and guns
702.44s - 703.80s |  and you're seven layers down.
703.80s - 704.92s |  Does it really matter at that point
704.92s - 706.60s |  if your sticky note has that?
707.56s - 709.12s |  I don't think it does.
709.12s - 712.68s |  Because if your adversary's in there that far anyway,
712.68s - 714.16s |  you're done.
715.08s - 717.84s |  But what you need is to be able to get into that HMI
717.84s - 719.24s |  or get into that thing really quick
719.24s - 721.12s |  to turn that thing off or on or whatever.
721.12s - 723.28s |  So it's a balance, right?
723.28s - 725.32s |  If you have a gateway device,
725.32s - 727.72s |  no, don't use admin, admin, that's really bad.
727.72s - 729.68s |  Complicated passwords.
729.68s - 731.52s |  And then segmentation.
731.52s - 734.80s |  Now, those are the three things that we come back
734.80s - 736.40s |  and say, hey, you do those three things,
736.40s - 738.52s |  you're going to make your life
738.52s - 741.56s |  or your network so much more secure.
741.56s - 742.88s |  Do we have a lot of other things off that?
742.88s - 744.20s |  Yes, but those are the three things
744.20s - 745.36s |  that we keep on going back.
745.36s - 747.12s |  So how does that tie in with labs?
747.16s - 748.28s |  Well, how do you patch something?
748.28s - 749.52s |  How do you go and change that password?
749.52s - 752.16s |  How do you update that X509 server
752.16s - 753.76s |  or whatever cert you have?
753.76s - 755.00s |  That's not trivial.
755.00s - 758.40s |  If you're doing it, okay, that works.
758.40s - 760.40s |  But now, come back three years later
760.40s - 761.36s |  and learn how those certs work
761.36s - 762.64s |  and how you updated that.
762.64s - 764.92s |  Guarantee, unless you're doing that on a day-by-day,
764.92s - 766.76s |  you're not going to figure it out.
766.76s - 769.40s |  But now it's running a real production device.
769.40s - 773.08s |  So it's, I already hear they're yelling at us
773.08s - 775.08s |  to get off the stage now.
775.08s - 777.08s |  Anyway, we came late.
777.92s - 779.16s |  We have a lot of stuff to talk about.
779.16s - 781.92s |  Come downstairs, ICS Village.
781.92s - 784.00s |  We have a lot of really great volunteers down there.
784.00s - 786.20s |  Bryce and I are down there.
786.20s - 787.36s |  We'll show you what's going on.
787.36s - 788.88s |  We will do all that stuff.
788.88s - 789.92s |  He's yelling at me again.
789.92s - 791.44s |  The second time he's come in,
791.44s - 793.40s |  that guy in the red shirt,
793.40s - 795.36s |  yelling at the guys that were late.
795.36s - 796.44s |  Thank you, everyone.
796.44s - 801.04s |  Our apologies for coming up here and doing this.
801.04s - 802.96s |  Yes, yes, yes.
802.96s - 811.65s |  Ashley, yes.
811.65s - 813.45s |  So it's not what we do.
813.49s - 816.53s |  We go off of usually like SANS critical controls.
816.53s - 818.25s |  We go off of industry things
818.25s - 819.45s |  because why?
819.45s - 820.29s |  They work.
820.29s - 821.13s |  They're right.
821.13s - 830.40s |  That's what you need.
830.40s - 831.60s |  Yep, we're happy to do that.
831.60s - 832.44s |  We're done.
832.44s - 833.28s |  We're done.
833.28s - 834.12s |  Thank you.
