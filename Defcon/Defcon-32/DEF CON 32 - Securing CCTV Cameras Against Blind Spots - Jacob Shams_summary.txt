**Securing CCTV Cameras Against Blind Spots**

- **Objective**: Investigate the side effect of **object detection** in CCTV footage and location-based confidence weakness.
- **Blind Spots**: Areas detected with lower confidence due to distance, angle, or height of objects.
- **Analysis**: Conducted under four lighting conditions (lab, morning, afternoon, night) using five object detectors (YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, SSD, DiffusionDet, RTMDet).

**Pedestrian Detection and Confidence Levels**

- **Factors Affecting Detection**: Position of a person (distance, angle, height) affects detector confidence.
- **Confidence Variation**: Detectors show confidence variation up to 0.7 based on position.
- **Video Analysis**: Conducted in different lighting conditions; consistent behavior across detectors like YOLOv3 and Faster R-CNN.
- **Camera Quality Impact**: Downgraded footage (1080p to 720p and 480p) showed persistent behavior, indicating independence from camera quality.

**TipToe Evasion Attack**

- **Concept**: Utilize blind spots to construct a path with minimum detection confidence.
- **Methodology**: Modify Dijkstra's algorithm to identify paths with the lowest maximum confidence node.
- **Threat Model**: Attackers manipulate paths without adversarial methods or machinery.
- **Evaluation**: TipToe reduces maximum and average confidence in paths by up to 0.1 and 0.16, respectively.

**Conclusion**

- **Object Detector Sensitivity**: Detectors are sensitive to changes in position; independent of model, video quality, and lighting conditions.
- **Public Area Analysis**: Confidence varies with pedestrian location in the frame.
- **Evasion Strategy**: TipToe effectively lowers detection confidence by leveraging frame positions.

**Questions and Discussion**

- Audience engagement through questions and clarifications about the methodology and implications of the findings.
