**Electronic Conference Badges**

- Electronic badges require significant investment in terms of **hardware**, **software**, **art design**, **testing**, **manufacturing**, and **provisioning**.
- **OpenTaxus** is introduced as a **simple**, **cheap**, **mass-producible**, and **open-source** badge design.
- Customization in **hardware** and **software** is possible using **KiCAD** for hardware and **CircuitPython** for software.

**Customization and Design Vision**

- Emphasis on **reuse** and **customization**.
- **Open hardware** allows for easy modification without starting from scratch.
- Possibilities include changing artwork, software, or even just the conference name while keeping the base design.

**Badge Design Walkthrough**

- **Hardware changes** can be made in KiCAD.
- **Software customization** is possible with CircuitPython, which allows for ease of use without needing a compiler.
- Infrared communication is used for **short-range** interactions, keeping privacy in mind.

**Cost Reduction and Manufacturing**

- Cost reduction is a priority, with a target of **$5** per badge.
- Use of **RP2040** microcontroller for cost efficiency.
- Manufacturing tips include using **offshore assembly** for better pricing on components.

**Vision for OpenTaxus**

- Aim to have a platform where organizers can input conference details and receive **board files**, **bill of materials**, and **code** without starting from scratch.
- Encouragement to collaborate between **PCB designers** and **embedded software developers**.

**Logistics and Pitfalls**

- **Hand soldering** is not recommended for large quantities; use **mass manufacturing**.
- **Flashing** and provisioning require careful handling to avoid system errors.
- **Schedule management** is crucial; always allow more time than anticipated.

**Conclusion**

- **OpenTaxus** aims to make badge creation accessible, customizable, and cost-efficient.
- Encouragement to use **CircuitPython** for its accessibility and ease of use.
- Opportunity for learning and interacting with hardware and software through badge customization.
