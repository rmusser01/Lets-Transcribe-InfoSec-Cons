**Introduction**
- Speaker: Michael Aguilar
- **Topic**: Dysfunctional Unity in Medical Device Security
- **Background**: Principal consultant for SecureWorks Adversary Group
- Discusses vulnerabilities in medical devices and challenges with SBOM, CVEs, and security guidelines

**Speaker's Expertise**
- Offensive security practices including physical security, social engineering, adversary simulations, and exploitations
- Interest in cycling, running, swimming, and loud music

**Medical Device Security Concerns**
- Vulnerabilities in medical devices and hospital networks
- **Dysfunction**: Abnormal interpersonal behavior among security researchers, manufacturers, and rule enforcers
- Issues with CVE release and federal guidelines

**Challenges with Vulnerability Disclosure**
- Difficulty in releasing CVEs due to manufacturer control over CNAs
- Long delays in addressing vulnerabilities
- Importance of fixing vulnerabilities to prevent exploitation

**Security Guidelines and Issues**
- Federal guidelines are recommendations, not mandates
- Manufacturers often neglect necessary security measures
- **Interconnected Devices**: Risks associated with networked medical devices

**Exploitation Risks**
- **Legacy Devices**: Use outdated protocols and hardware
- **Network Ports**: Often left unprotected in hospitals
- **Active Directory Vulnerabilities**: Potential for privilege escalation and domain takeover

**Physical Security**
- **Protected Areas**: Often not secure enough
- Importance of continuous adversarial assessments

**Testing and Assessments**
- Need for thorough testing, not just superficial scans
- Importance of hiring skilled testers for comprehensive security assessments

**Future Outlook**
- **Collaboration**: Importance of working together to improve security
- **Neutral Grounds**: Need for unbiased CVE reporting and handling

**Conclusion**
- Call for better decisions in medical device security
- Encouragement for collaboration to address critical vulnerabilities and improve overall safety
