**Presentation Overview**
- Topic: Exposing vulnerabilities in large off-grid solar systems
- Speakers: Dan Berte & Alexandru Lazar from Bitdefender
- Focus: Three significant vulnerabilities in solar management platforms posing national security risks

**Research Background**
- Experience: Over 10 years in IoT vulnerability research
- Publications: 25+ high-profile cases, numerous white papers
- Notable Cases: Ring doorbell, LG TVs, Amazon Fire Stick, August lock, Wyze cameras

**Vendor Responsiveness**
- **Concerning Statistics**:
  - 30% of vendors do not reply or delay responses
  - 20% take over a year to address vulnerabilities or never patch them
- **PSA to Vendors**:
  - Appoint a permanent contact
  - Set up a vulnerability disclosure program
  - Use a PGP key and monitor the inbox

**Power Grid Threats**
- **Natural vs. Cyber Threats**: Squirrels and natural events are major threats, not cyberattacks
- **Squirrel Terrorism**: Most frequent disruptors of the power grid

**Solar Energy Security Concerns**
- **Growth**: Over 500 gigawatts added last year
- **Security Question**: Is it keeping up with the growth?
- **Investigation Focus**: Manufacturer Dey and platform Solarman

**Vulnerability Findings**
- **Initial Investigation**: Man-in-the-middle attack on Dey cloud app
- **Hard-Coded Credentials**: Found in login requests
- **Access Point Vulnerability**:
  - Exploit requires physical proximity
  - Possible to access user interface and network

**Platform Flaws**
- **Search API Leakage**: Exposes user and organization data
- **Account Takeover Potential**: Over 1 million accounts vulnerable
- **Token Exploitation**:
  - Tokens from Dey work on Solarman
  - ID and email changes allow account access

**Impact and Response**
- **Affected Users**: Estimated 3.5 million users, 330,000 businesses
- **Potential Risks**: Overloading or underloading the grid
- **Platform Reach**: Serves 20% of global solar capacity
- **Vendor Response**: Some vendors patched vulnerabilities quickly

**Call to Action**
- **Vendor Recommendations**:
  - Establish vulnerability handling protocols
  - Use PGP keys for secure communication
- **Encouragement**: Visit IT village for more information and challenges

**Conclusion**
- **Security Awareness**: Highlighting potential changes in threat landscape
- **Open Invitation**: Audience invited to ask questions and engage further
