  "description": "DEF CON is a siren song for the hacker mind. Clever people around the world hear it and are pulled, every year, to Las Vegas. They mass by the tens of thousands, streaming through the halls of DEF CON to watch talks given by absolute legends about incredible escapades, to gaze in wonder as true wizards bend bytes to their will in the CTF room, and to dream about one day reaching to those heights themselves.\n\nSome have the critical combination of grit, perseverance, raw talent, and (let's face it) privilege to push through to those dreams of greatness. But among even the clever and the motivated, it is rare for n00bs to rise to l33tness without support. Some find this support in inspiring classes in college. Others, among friends or mentors. But many don't find it at all, and remain in the hallways, dreaming.\n\nDo you want to leave the hallways and hack the planet? We are hackers, educators, and learners who are creating DEF CON Academy, a concerted effort to maximize hacker potential by providing open, clear, approachable, and inclusive practical resources for budding hackers to transcend and rule cyberspace. Through extensive DEF CON event presence and year-round hacking resources, we will pro up the noobs of the world and bring the community, at scale, to the next level of skill.\n\nCome, listen, and learn how we can help!",

0.02s - 6.50s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Alright. Welcome to the sneak peek for uh something you're super excited about. Barry and I
6.50s - 13.50s |  have been working on this for a little while now. Um along with the amazing people you see
13.50s - 18.50s |  on stage here. We'll talk about everybody in turn. But first we'll talk about Defcon Academy.
21.18s - 26.18s |  So. Uh is there a can people see the slides somewhere? Oh they can. Oh great perfect. Alright.
27.18s - 32.18s |  So first things first. On the slide there's a URL. CTF dot Defcon Academy. While we talk go
37.62s - 42.62s |  there. CTF dot Defcon Academy. On the bottom there's a link to get started with a little
46.00s - 52.80s |  challenge race. It's not extraordinarily hard stuff. It's it's test your Linux knowledge. How
52.80s - 59.26s |  much Linux do you know? At the end we're gonna do a little award ceremony for the people
59.26s - 63.34s |  farthest ahead in that race. We'll just see how many people we have time to give challenge
63.34s - 68.24s |  points to. It's gonna be awesome. And we'll check in throughout the the talk if we have time.
68.24s - 73.24s |  Awesome. Okay. Welcome. Let's talk about us. Yes. I think that's a great idea. Uh Barry take it
75.62s - 82.26s |  away. I don't know why I'm first. But. Hi. My name is Perry Adams. I'm currently a uh special
82.28s - 87.62s |  assistant to the director at DARPA. But before that I was as you can see on the screen a uh
87.62s - 93.96s |  CTF player. That picture in the middle is proof that at one point in time I did know how to use a
93.96s - 98.96s |  computer. Uh the jury's still out on if that's still the case. Uh oh. Uh case in point.
103.00s - 108.00s |  Computers. How do they even work? Uh but I played for uh the CTF team RPI sec and that picture
108.96s - 113.96s |  is of us playing at DEF CON finals uh in 2018. And uh RPI sec and CTF was really how I got
118.96s - 124.34s |  started playing uh I got started in computer security. And that's really what we're gonna be
124.34s - 129.74s |  talking about today. The kind of uh education that that provided me and how we want to give
129.74s - 135.12s |  that to the rest of you. As I was putting together these slides uh what was next to all those
135.14s - 140.18s |  pictures was a picture of my cat and because it's DEF CON I thought it was appropriate to at
140.18s - 145.72s |  least have one of those in the slides. Uh after I played CTF for a while I ran DEF CON CTF
145.72s - 151.46s |  for a little bit. Uh that is uh from one of the years where we were writing challenges. That
151.46s - 158.26s |  picture is of uh three uh two of my uh uh fellow challenge authors the year that our challenge
158.26s - 163.20s |  melted the infrastructure just a little bit which goes to show that computers are hard and
163.22s - 168.92s |  I'm not sure if I know how to use them correctly. And now in my day job I am at DARPA where
168.92s - 174.80s |  one of the things that I have done is create AICC which if you haven't seen yet I really
174.80s - 180.56s |  encourage you to go check it out over there. We're very proud of what we've been able to do.
180.56s - 187.08s |  And the kind of software security challenges that AICC is working to address is exactly what
187.12s - 193.96s |  we hope to educate people about with DEF CON Academy. And uh finally I have this picture up
193.96s - 200.70s |  here because I talked about how I learned about computer security by playing CTF but what was
200.70s - 207.08s |  so formative for me was having my teammates on RPISEC to help me learn. When I first got
207.08s - 213.08s |  started they told me that I could not have hypothetically let's say they told me I could not
213.08s - 218.10s |  have IDA until I had learned how to solve a CTF challenge using OBJDUMP. And if you haven't
221.10s - 227.20s |  seen the output of OBJDUMP that's what a binary looks like. It's much less pretty than IDA and
227.20s - 233.28s |  this was of course before we had Ghidra. But when I was doing this I had people I could call
233.28s - 238.18s |  I had uh I could phone a friend I could get help and that's really what we're trying to do.
238.18s - 242.46s |  What they've been trying to do with DEF CON Academy.
242.46s - 248.50s |  Thanks Mary. So before I talk about myself which I love doing I want to uh check on one
248.50s - 254.20s |  terrifying thing. Oh this is counting upwards. Okay thank God. Alright. Awesome. So then we can
254.20s - 264.20s |  just calmly continue. Alright. I'm Zardis and I am uh I can say with some trepidation that I'm
265.08s - 273.80s |  that I'm way too loud. Um that I've been coming to DEF CON since DEF CON 9. This is super cool
273.80s - 285.84s |  DEF CON 9. Is that my feedback? You gotta keep them separated. DEF CON 9 was it's this guy.
286.72s - 311.43s |  That's what it's like working with Jan. Every day. Alright. You wanna. Every time.
317.22s - 327.30s |  Ladies and gentlemen the Dark Tangent. Honorary AV uh maestro. Okay cool. So um I've been coming
327.30s - 336.50s |  to DEF CON since DEF CON 9. Right. This was a long long time ago. Um and uh from DEF CON 9 up
336.50s - 342.58s |  until DEF CON 17 I would come to DEF CON. I'd wander the halls. I'd look around at all this
342.58s - 349.78s |  incredible hacking. I'd get really amped up but I wasn't really making progress. I was slowly
349.78s - 354.50s |  very very slowly building up my skills over the course of eight years and then after eight years
354.50s - 362.26s |  an eternity in cyber security time I finally got into CTF. I started playing CTF with team
362.26s - 371.22s |  Shellfish and then my life as a hacker ah my life as a hacker accelerated rapidly. Uh within
371.22s - 378.02s |  a couple years from that I'd created with uh my uh colleagues one of the uh most powerful
378.02s - 388.02s |  binary analysis tools on the planet. Later with uh also amazing colleagues we started hosting
388.02s - 393.54s |  DEF CON CTF. We went from running it uh from playing in it to hosting it. Then I became a
393.54s - 402.98s |  professor. That's still us? I gotta get to my alright. Uh later we went from uh
403.54s - 407.54s |  playing to hosting and then I became professor at Arizona State University.
409.99s - 417.64s |  Dude I feel like I'm at a sci-fi. This is awesome. This is great. We can probably just turn this one
417.64s - 432.45s |  off. Awesome. Okay. So um and all of this happened relatively quickly once I started playing CTF and
432.45s - 440.45s |  once my security knowledge started getting ramped up very rapidly and there was this inflection point
440.45s - 448.21s |  in DEF CON 17 but that took eight years to get there right and what I've been thinking for a
448.21s - 454.21s |  long long time is how do we accelerate that? What was missing here? And Perry alluded to it.
455.17s - 466.13s |  When I started I didn't have a group that could mentor. I was a high schooler but that doesn't
466.13s - 471.81s |  stop people. I've seen high schoolers accelerate rapidly in cyber security skill when they have
471.81s - 481.51s |  the right environment to enable them right and so our question was our question was how do we
482.15s - 488.95s |  actually make this possible for the DEF CON community? Alright. Preview. It looks like a belt.
489.83s - 501.67s |  Alright. So DEF CON 17. Shellfish. DEF CON CTF. This is my view into what the difference was from
501.67s - 506.87s |  before I was a pro to after I was a pro and and spoiler alert I'm still not a pro but I would
506.87s - 513.91s |  tell all of my students if you want to get really great at cyber security you have to go play CTF
513.91s - 521.83s |  right and this is a picture for example of my students playing one of the CTFs that I hosted
521.83s - 531.59s |  with Adam who's sitting right here and they show up and they do awesome but this is the success
531.59s - 538.39s |  stories that you see what you don't see in the CTF community is the hundreds and hundreds of
538.39s - 547.27s |  students for every one that play CTF that try to play CTF and face the reality that
547.27s - 554.47s |  capture the flag competitions are not designed for education they're designed to test your skills
555.43s - 567.86s |  so this is intentional in CTF. A CTF competition is created by hackers for hackers to challenge
567.86s - 575.86s |  hackers specifically and no one wants to play a CTF where the answers are all obvious and the
575.86s - 582.74s |  challenges are easy and so on and and so CTFs basically by definition become a very boring
582.74s - 587.62s |  teaching tool. And when I got started playing CTF the thing that was fun about it was that I had a
588.26s - 594.10s |  team who I'd play with and we'd go and we'd spend 48 hours in a lecture hall that we certainly did
594.10s - 600.74s |  not we weren't allowed to actually be in overnight but that's what we would do and it felt very
600.74s - 605.70s |  collaborative and we could learn from each other but for many people they don't have that resource.
606.58s - 613.46s |  Yeah and so figuring out what a replacement resource is for that that's one of the challenges
613.46s - 620.66s |  that we kind of set to ourselves that resulted in DEFCON Academy. That's DEFCON Academy's first
620.66s - 628.50s |  goal. Our first goal is getting people from DEFCON 9 to DEFCON 17. Getting them to the point where
628.50s - 635.78s |  they can start have the skills to start playing CTF to start contributing actively in cyber
635.78s - 644.42s |  security and then we have a second question. Something that I've seen recently as I've
644.42s - 649.94s |  trained up more and more students with cyber security knowledge is that people learn this
649.94s - 656.26s |  knowledge they have the technical skills to dive into CTF competitions to really start accelerating
656.26s - 662.42s |  more and more and more but they there's still something missing. The competition part of a CTF
662.42s - 670.66s |  competition the chaotic environment the lack of educational resources specific to do with
670.66s - 677.22s |  cutting-edge CTF challenges that makes things hard and that is where the mentorship that Barry
677.22s - 684.18s |  mentioned comes in. So how do we streamline that process? Get people once they have technical skills
684.18s - 689.54s |  to actually engage with a community where they can test these skills and and interact with others
689.54s - 700.34s |  that are doing so. Then how do we keep pulling that talent back into DEFCON so that we can have a
701.94s - 707.30s |  kind of self-reinforcing loop that'll continue with the community continue building the community
707.30s - 720.60s |  more and more. A little louder? Then I get the if I do this hold on test all right we're still good
720.60s - 730.60s |  okay no uh you know tone of god over here okay so um and then of course once people go and they
730.60s - 734.76s |  they they learn all the cyber security stuff and they're cyber security master hackers how do we
734.76s - 741.64s |  get people to actually be able to use this as a living? How many of you make a living doing
741.64s - 751.72s |  cyber security? Awesome. How many don't but would like to? All right so how do we get you
752.84s - 758.60s |  to the place where you can make that living? And then how many of you are cyber security pros
759.24s - 767.83s |  master hackers? I see my students trying to raise their hands over there uh one day well we'll get
767.83s - 774.95s |  you there as well. All right so the answer of course DEFCON Academy and DEFCON Academy is going
774.95s - 781.75s |  to at least take steps to solve all of these problems. So Perry what do you hope to see out
781.75s - 789.35s |  of DEFCON Academy? Well so DARPA has a history of funding work in uh cyber security education but
789.35s - 797.03s |  specifically in things like binary exploitation vulnerability research etc uh things like DARPA
797.03s - 803.43s |  chess uh focus on uh improving computer human interactions that was something that you all
803.43s - 809.43s |  worked on. We actually have some other PMs in the office or in the audience who are leading some of
809.43s - 816.07s |  these efforts and so that was really what DEFCON Academy came out of for for DARPA was how can we
816.07s - 822.23s |  bring the cyber security education resources that we've been developing and open sourcing
822.23s - 828.15s |  uh with uh the many groups that DARPA works with including ASU and how do we bring them to the
828.15s - 835.51s |  community? And so what I really hope to get out of this is uh we've spent a decade more than that
835.51s - 841.67s |  uh researching how to best educate people in this space uh that combined with all of the expertise
841.67s - 847.91s |  that running DEFCON CTF playing DEFCON CTF and other kinds of CTFs have built up I I think there's
847.91s - 853.11s |  a huge amount of potential to revolutionize how we do cyber security education especially in
853.11s - 859.51s |  the vulnerability research binary exploitation memory safety space which is so fundamentally
859.51s - 867.35s |  important today. I agree and you know what I would build on that with is that whatever specific
868.31s - 877.43s |  first uh goal you set for students binary exploitation memory safety etc the if you can get
877.43s - 884.47s |  a hacker to skill up to that you can get them to skill up to web security you can get them to skill
884.47s - 893.43s |  up to network operations to threat hunting it all folds together and use a common uh process of
893.91s - 903.03s |  process of learning and thinking about our own experiences talking long long hours with
903.03s - 911.51s |  dark tangent we came up with this idea that hey let's actually make a part of DEFCON that is
912.07s - 917.99s |  hyper optimized to make this happen for students. So but I want to add one other thing too the other
917.99s - 922.79s |  part of this is is uh set up and the pain and suffering that goes into actually creating an
922.79s - 927.67s |  environment in which you can learn uh and the infrastructure part is boring and sometimes we
927.67s - 931.91s |  don't think about that as research but having played a lot of CTF I know that setting up an
931.91s - 936.55s |  environment is very annoying very painful and when I first started out that was the last thing I
936.55s - 941.75s |  wanted to learn how to do. I didn't know how to boot Linux when I joined RPISec that's very
941.75s - 947.83s |  embarrassing uh so I'm sharing it here today and we're not gonna spread that uh and so I think one
947.83s - 955.35s |  of the best aspects of this and one of the uh other pillars is that it removes the initial uh
955.35s - 961.03s |  pain from learning and it puts you into the fun environment immediately. So how can we
962.55s - 968.95s |  take a random DEFCON attendee grab them out of the hallway and once they start stop screaming and
968.95s - 977.51s |  hitting us actually give them an opportunity to just start learning immediately. No startup costs
978.23s - 986.39s |  no confusion just go and in other words how can we take this DEFCON 9 to DEFCON 17 eight years
987.27s - 993.99s |  and we narrow them down well. I actually think the best way to put it is how can we make Connor
993.99s - 1000.79s |  do all of the infrastructure set up for uh DEFCON attendees. Exactly it's uh basically uh
1001.19s - 1007.99s |  uh tasking all the way down um because the answer to that is Connor will find his own students.
1009.27s - 1015.27s |  All right so there's two parts to learning there's a lot of learning research learning
1015.27s - 1021.67s |  learning is is a thing that humans have done maybe for years maybe even decades. So
1022.55s - 1028.79s |  there's theory and practice right you might say well okay let's have a DEFCON academy that that
1028.79s - 1035.99s |  runs courses we'll like have uh you know our powerpoint slides we'll pull in hackers off the
1035.99s - 1041.59s |  out of the hallway and we'll uh have them viewing the powerpoint slides and I did this I do this a
1041.59s - 1046.31s |  lot this is a picture of my students from last semester. No I'm just kidding I pulled this off
1046.31s - 1052.47s |  the internet but because my students are all riveted in class but just like you all exactly
1053.27s - 1059.51s |  you have all been in classes throughout your life where things are boring people are rambling on
1059.51s - 1067.35s |  about the stack gets subtracted from when a function starts and you get a lot of information
1067.35s - 1072.79s |  and not a lot of it sticks right you might have like one or two practice problems but
1073.91s - 1079.27s |  the modern state unfortunately of cyber security education is actually pretty poor
1079.67s - 1085.59s |  and this is uh really interesting because it's understandable academically there's this thing
1085.59s - 1090.95s |  called the learning pyramid full of really awesome made-up numbers where you know you can say hey if
1090.95s - 1096.47s |  I go and I lecture to you you will learn like five percent of the material or retain five percent of
1096.47s - 1101.99s |  the material but if I you know have you read about it uh yourself you'll you'll learn more
1102.95s - 1109.67s |  and if I uh have you practice actually practice the stuff you will learn a majority you'll learn
1109.67s - 1115.75s |  75 percent of it and then of course this whole thing the bottom you got to teach someone to
1115.75s - 1121.91s |  learn it all but this is called the learning pyramid it's like all um a lot of actual
1122.47s - 1130.47s |  education research that has come into gone into building this and it really um showcases kind of
1130.47s - 1138.71s |  what's wrong with a lot of modern cyber security education and what you end up with most modern
1138.71s - 1145.51s |  coursework is you get an enormous amount of information you pump up your brain you get the
1145.51s - 1153.43s |  theoretical info but you can't really apply it in practice and it's like if in karate kid
1153.43s - 1159.91s |  mr miyagi made uh explained to the karate kid how to wash a car and they never actually did
1159.91s - 1164.39s |  the wax on wax off and then he throws him into the ring and the kid gets beat up and we don't
1164.39s - 1174.07s |  have our awesome uh ending all right so can't quite do existing coursework all right well that's
1174.07s - 1180.31s |  not a problem because there's a whole conference where every year for an entire weekend people
1180.31s - 1188.79s |  descend into las vegas and learn and and and and celebrate hacking and party which conference is
1188.79s - 1196.07s |  that yawn i forget the name escapes me at the moment jeff do you know sorry i'm unplugged
1198.23s - 1205.75s |  everyone has uh yeah i've heard rumors yeah exactly i i think it might be um penny arcade expo
1205.75s - 1215.57s |  no of course we're talking about you all about defcon but i went to a defcons it's very easy
1215.57s - 1219.89s |  to go to a defcon and wander around aimlessly who here has aimlessly wandered through defcon
1220.85s - 1227.01s |  yeah yeah me too and and and it's an incredible experience you have to of course aimlessly
1227.01s - 1234.29s |  wander through defcon for some amount of time but we also want to have a much more streamlined
1234.29s - 1242.05s |  optimized and guided path to learning available to the people that want it all right so then
1242.05s - 1249.33s |  when i started the professor i said okay i understand all this stuff now i see that ctf
1249.33s - 1254.29s |  is a problem because i keep sending my students to ctf and they keep you know just disappearing
1258.40s - 1269.12s |  yeah but there are these things called war games war games are these incredible collections of
1269.12s - 1276.64s |  challenges online i maintain a list at wargame.nexus if you're interested hundreds thousands
1276.64s - 1282.24s |  of hacking challenges available to anyone that wants them you can go and and and and start right
1282.24s - 1291.84s |  the problem is it's very similar to what plagues ctf from an educational perspective right perry
1291.84s - 1298.32s |  you've done war games i have and actually i think rpi sacks modern binary exploitation one of the
1298.32s - 1304.16s |  first uh online courses uh in this uh in this stuff is on that list and that was how i learned
1304.80s - 1310.40s |  it is and modern binary exploitation is an excellent example of a war game created
1310.40s - 1316.80s |  educationally because it has educational materials and it has challenges to reinforce this but the
1316.80s - 1324.08s |  majority of war games out on the internet are also made to show off the challenge writing skill of
1324.08s - 1332.64s |  the author which is awesome and test and and and challenge the people solving which it makes it
1332.64s - 1337.92s |  very difficult to actually learn with i'll say that i could not have done the course material i
1337.92s - 1342.80s |  did i could not have done the war games i did without having friends who could help me when i
1342.80s - 1348.24s |  got when i got stuck that was that was the defining factor and so what what i found when i would push
1348.24s - 1354.00s |  this war game idea is that it worked as long as i was there to mentor the students about once a week
1354.48s - 1362.32s |  the moment i disappeared the war game attempt broke down as a learning uh route at scale
1363.04s - 1369.84s |  right and you know you can't really blame people for this there you can only sit so long at a
1369.84s - 1374.72s |  computer confused and and lost look at this picture this guy's even thinking of going to
1374.72s - 1379.60s |  the beach down there on the top left for some reason um before it gets too old but
1379.92s - 1384.64s |  but as barry said there are good educational style
1386.24s - 1391.76s |  materials out there and we kind of ran with this and this is something we're bringing into
1391.76s - 1401.12s |  Defcon Academy we created Pwn College. Yon, what is Pwn College? Well Barry, I'm glad you asked.
1402.08s - 1410.80s |  Pwn College is a revolution in online security education but it's only one it's a paradigm shift
1410.80s - 1416.16s |  it's a paradigm shift Jeff understands the uh DoD language that i'm trying to bring to the talk
1416.16s - 1422.00s |  today exactly but the talk isn't necessarily about Pwn College we're using Pwn College
1422.00s - 1430.32s |  as an example here as one part of Defcon Academy uh Pwn College is an online teaching tool first
1431.44s - 1438.64s |  and challenge tool second and I'll show you what I mean the way that we teach in Pwn College is we
1438.64s - 1446.80s |  take a topic over here we have this this this guided path carefully curated through for real
1446.80s - 1452.56s |  we're 10 minutes late 10 minutes left I'm just starting to to talk 10 minutes until
1453.28s - 1459.52s |  till belting okay okay and I'd encourage you to visit uh Pwn.college uh right now Yon claims that
1459.52s - 1468.72s |  you can even do it on your phone yeah you can so quick thing Pwn.college guided materials it has
1470.24s - 1478.80s |  lectures that introduce the core of a topic that five percent and then to explore the edge cases
1478.80s - 1484.40s |  that you will be confused about if you only retain that five percent we have challenge problems
1485.36s - 1491.92s |  hundreds of challenge problems that will pull your knowledge wider and wider and wider and
1491.92s - 1497.92s |  let you understand the concept it's as if we took Mr. Miyagi and we put him in your web browser
1499.88s - 1504.60s |  Pwn.college starts at the very beginning which some of you are doing right now the Linux Luminarium
1504.60s - 1511.08s |  goes through incredibly advanced material where by the time you finish Pwn.college you will have
1511.16s - 1520.68s |  exploited uh JIT vulnerabilities in Chrome's v8 etc etc yeah and I want to interject and say that
1520.68s - 1525.88s |  this is all in your web browser like you just said and that is a fundamentally important concept
1525.88s - 1532.76s |  here uh when I uh showed that uh objjump earlier I was on my iPad and I needed a Linux terminal
1532.76s - 1537.32s |  and I just pulled up Pwn.college and I booted into it but when you say there's v8 challenges
1537.32s - 1543.08s |  when you say there's Linux kernel challenges that is the truly impactful thing students don't have
1543.08s - 1546.76s |  to stand up their Linux kernel they can go to the browser students don't have to stand up a Linux
1546.76s - 1552.60s |  environment they can go to the browser and it's an Ubuntu uh instance with Ghidra and Idafree
1552.60s - 1560.28s |  and all of the resources they might need that is very powerful. And in fact we can well let's see
1560.28s - 1566.92s |  if we have time to demo it we were going to demo it on stage but that's fine um there is an
1566.92s - 1572.44s |  enormous amount of material already we're building out more to pull DEF CON hackers
1573.24s - 1580.92s |  kicking and screaming through into having uh practical demonstrable skills that they can
1580.92s - 1592.20s |  then build up on we have uh let's uh actually talk about one thing here we have a set of material
1592.20s - 1598.60s |  where at every stage of your cyber security journey you get a reward you've gamified learning
1598.60s - 1604.60s |  and we've done it with belts over here in about 10 minutes we'll have a belting ceremony
1605.96s - 1609.64s |  where people that have gone through the material before will earn their belts
1611.08s - 1617.64s |  and walk out of here belted. Who uh. The first uh the first of a yearly ceremony something we'll
1617.64s - 1624.12s |  talk about very soon. Who uh who here is gonna get belted? Awesome you guys start lining up
1625.00s - 1633.16s |  and we'll give you all a hand in a second all right so uh and and and this is a uh
1633.16s - 1638.60s |  tradition now in Pwn College that goes back a long way this is uh me with with Connor and his PhD
1638.60s - 1644.12s |  defense um and he's uh. Sign up on the uh on this side of the stage. A bunch of belts here we send
1644.12s - 1652.92s |  them out all over the world and we drive you into these crazy experiences with Pwn College where
1652.92s - 1657.96s |  like we said earlier you're exploiting v8 you're exploiting the Linux kernel you understand all of
1657.96s - 1664.92s |  this ideally understand it well on a practical perspective when where you can demonstrably
1664.92s - 1670.52s |  carry out these exploits even though you might have come to Pwn College without knowing what
1670.52s - 1678.44s |  Linux is right. As Perry says this is all doable on the internet turnkey you just go to Pwn.college
1678.44s - 1685.08s |  and you start up. All right so that's Pwn College that's not Defcon Academy. What is Defcon Academy?
1686.04s - 1693.24s |  Defcon Academy will use Pwn College and other resources like Pwn College another amazing one
1693.24s - 1699.88s |  is CryptoHack. Who here has heard of CryptoHack? Awesome if you like Pwn College also check out
1699.88s - 1706.28s |  CryptoHack it is in a lot of ways extremely similar in philosophy but for cryptography
1706.28s - 1718.04s |  right. During the Defcon party event during this weekend we're going to have a dedicated space
1718.04s - 1725.88s |  where you can go and you can start Pwn College you can continue Pwn College you can earn belts
1726.60s - 1736.76s |  for your uh progress in Pwn College where we'll have dedicated tutors like Perry Adams
1737.48s - 1746.53s |  who will sit down and remember when she was doing her first buffer overflow. And Connor Nelson
1747.17s - 1749.57s |  and Adam Dupay. I don't know if you want me as your tutor.
1750.13s - 1759.09s |  Um we'll have skill demonstrations we'll have uh exploitation races between people that have
1759.09s - 1764.85s |  just learned the material we'll have a lot of hype it's going to be really really awesome right and
1764.85s - 1769.65s |  it's going to be a place at Defcon specifically created specifically dedicated toward learning
1771.25s - 1778.05s |  specifically dedicated toward taking people that don't have the skills but want them and turning
1778.05s - 1783.81s |  them into people who do have the skills and are ready to apply them and we'll have something going
1783.81s - 1791.41s |  year round year round we will have regular help sessions live on twitch or discord where we will
1791.97s - 1798.93s |  help people learn four minutes and these these guys so all right we've covered the first third
1798.93s - 1805.89s |  of the talk so far yeah don't worry it's our fault that's how we we start in but as I mentioned after
1805.89s - 1811.65s |  people build the skills there's still a bit of a gap in applying them in practice whether it's a
1811.65s - 1822.05s |  chaotic environment of a CTF or a um or a you know the real world of of cyber security and so for the
1822.05s - 1829.01s |  chaotic environment of the CTF we have a solution with Defcon Academy sorry with Defcon Academy
1829.01s - 1835.73s |  we are working with some of the top CTF teams in the world the people that you see most years
1836.69s - 1844.45s |  up there on the the Defcon CTF contest area hacking away their entire Defcon with crazy
1844.45s - 1852.21s |  difficult cutting edge challenges and we're working with them to create a CTF Academy
1852.21s - 1858.77s |  where as you graduate from those first eight years track which hopefully will be compressed a
1858.77s - 1866.29s |  lot as you graduate from Pwn College and similar platforms you will be apprenticed in CTF teams
1866.29s - 1871.01s |  with top hackers such as Clasm over there who lead you through
1873.09s - 1879.65s |  who will lead you through learning to actually dive into real security all right how will we
1879.65s - 1885.41s |  help Defcon itself with Defcon Academy not just the attendees but the the community well
1886.05s - 1893.41s |  we'll skip to one specific thing a couple days ago or yesterday I guess uh um
1895.41s - 1905.81s |  Jake Braun announced uh Defcon Franklin. Defcon Franklin is an initiative to help change the world
1905.81s - 1913.65s |  by facilitating the volunteering of Defcon resident expertise in places in the public world
1913.65s - 1918.77s |  where they're needed well they need the expertise and Defcon Academy will be creating a lot of
1918.77s - 1927.17s |  expertise we'll work to create a channel from Defcon Academy to Defcon Franklin to make this
1927.17s - 1933.73s |  a reality and give you who goes through Defcon Academy the output to show off those skills
1934.69s - 1944.61s |  all right um let's talk about who is part of Defcon Academy who is Defcon Academy
1944.61s - 1950.61s |  could you say that for a second first the Chancellor we have the Chancellor of Defcon
1950.61s - 1959.25s |  Academy the one and only the Dark Tangent then I forgot which order I have this in the Vice Chancellor
1960.21s - 1967.41s |  the Paribas the Provost of Defcon Academy yours truly
1968.21s - 1976.45s |  this is Artis we have the Dean of Binary Exploitation Adam Dupay elbow elbow wrist wrist
1977.73s - 1985.97s |  Adam Dupay is a uh uh master hacker who has hosted Defcon CTF right by my side you've seen
1986.85s - 1994.13s |  him with me uh at the closing ceremonies very very very lucky to have him supporting our binary
1994.13s - 2001.33s |  exploitation route the Dean of Reverse Engineering Fish if you know CTF you know this legend uh
2001.33s - 2008.61s |  probably one of the top reverse engineers in the world now teaching you how to be like him
2008.61s - 2014.05s |  which is a terrifying thought he can read straight assembly code like it's uh like
2014.05s - 2020.53s |  it's source code it's scary all right we got the Dean of Student Advocacy Rob Waas where are you
2020.53s - 2027.33s |  Rob Waas Rob Waas is advocating for uh students to get belts off stage over here and the Dean
2027.33s - 2036.29s |  of Educational Technologies Connor Nelson he is the reason that Pond College is usable over a browser
2036.29s - 2042.21s |  or usable at all really I wasn't joking when I said he's the one doing the infrastructure
2042.21s - 2047.49s |  all right that being said this is just what we're starting with the goal right now is to get a
2047.49s - 2053.81s |  minimum viable product of Defcon Academy because we're launching in full next year next year we'll
2053.81s - 2062.93s |  have in-person uh amazing uh area where you'll be able to learn etc etc etc and we'll have
2062.93s - 2067.49s |  kind of a proof of concept of all of it we'll have a proof of concept at least one CTF team
2068.45s - 2073.73s |  already shall we just sign up maybe at least two CTF teams that are ready to take and apprentice
2073.73s - 2081.17s |  awesome people we'll have multiple uh platforms like Pond College ready to go and we'll have
2081.81s - 2089.41s |  a couple of ways that you can go and help Defcon but as we extend we need more deans so if you
2089.41s - 2095.89s |  are interested in being a dean of Defcon Academy and are interested in spreading your knowledge
2096.53s - 2107.65s |  to budding hackers talk to us all right let's do the belts okay so Pond College has a set of
2107.65s - 2114.45s |  different steps and materials first students come in knowing nothing and they learn and they learn
2114.45s - 2120.85s |  introductory concepts in cyber security command injection in simple websites uh
2121.81s - 2127.73s |  uh file permission issues these sort of things after they learn that they earn the orange belt
2128.69s - 2135.97s |  they move on to learn about how the security of programs fail things like buffer overflows
2138.61s - 2144.93s |  things like how to reverse engineer programs to find issues etc they earned a yellow belt at that
2144.93s - 2150.93s |  stage they move on to system security talking about going from user space to kernel space
2152.21s - 2161.33s |  through a race condition uh uh vulnerability inside a kernel driver for example then they
2161.33s - 2169.25s |  earn the green belt and finally they go through crazy esoteric and advanced concepts in software
2169.25s - 2177.01s |  exploitation stuff like micro architectural uh side channel attacks and other just absolutely
2177.01s - 2182.85s |  wild things and they earn their blue belt so we'll be belting uh do we have blue belts today
2184.37s - 2191.33s |  wow three blue belts today all right awesome so we'll be belting all sorts of people right now
2191.33s - 2197.73s |  we'll go through them and dark tangent and the rest of the Defcon Academy team will confer
2198.21s - 2206.53s |  their new hacker ranks let's start with the orange okay awesome all right come on up
2208.85s - 2215.57s |  all right you can say your handle if you want uh gordon all right well congratulations
2218.05s - 2226.45s |  congrats and uh over here oh we'll get a picture all right and you are just john john just john
2226.45s - 2236.61s |  okay welcome yeah no all right up next we have i'm chloe chloe welcome congrats
2241.59s - 2253.16s |  jonathan jonathan welcome spicy dll spicy dll congratulations
2257.40s - 2261.96s |  oh dirac delta you're getting your blue belt no i'm giving yellow your yellow belt okay well
2261.96s - 2278.02s |  i recognize you anyways all right i'm such a noob sasha noobs josh l josh l josh l welcome
2287.48s - 2297.09s |  wherever i'm eddie eddie welcome all right these hackers have pushed through
2297.97s - 2308.69s |  increasingly insane material like material that really is is almost insane to have
2308.69s - 2314.05s |  in some educational contexts uh material where at the end of it these blue belts out there
2316.69s - 2322.13s |  yeah we'll do a picture we'll stand forever all right so the blue belts over here we're afraid
2322.13s - 2328.05s |  of them because i am a thousand percent sure that with their knowledge they're like one step away
2328.05s - 2341.04s |  from exploiting the punk college server itself all right let's honor these amazing hackers with
2341.04s - 2356.12s |  their achievement awesome all right good job guys so five minute mark okay so this is an event that
2356.12s - 2362.52s |  we're gonna get increasingly crazy about um in the in person now let's do the uh
2364.04s - 2368.68s |  yon is very sane he would never get crazy about anything yeah let's check out one more thing
2369.56s - 2387.08s |  ctf.defcon.academy we'll see the scoreboard oh oh it's not that's interesting yeah it's not one
2387.08s - 2395.56s |  sec i have to uh for us let me load out this up i think i have to hit escape nope
2398.04s - 2406.92s |  hit escape here yes perfect okay what's your password well the username is demo
2409.32s - 2416.76s |  all right actually right 404 file not found you gotta join that seems bad connor you gotta join
2417.72s - 2422.12s |  i don't want to join i just want to look at a scoreboard well you gotta join it's private okay
2424.90s - 2433.14s |  nice come on all right 20 people hacking now in the audience 24 people have solved things there's
2433.14s - 2443.30s |  603 total solves let's look at the rankings is our server melting absolutely not it's definitely
2443.38s - 2449.22s |  the defcon wi-fi it's not a live demo all right while while uh that's loading we'll just pull
2449.22s - 2455.94s |  this up on my phone have you tried refreshing it's spinning it's got i tried turning it on
2455.94s - 2464.42s |  and off again ctf oh this is this is probably it's loading it says loading there we go
2465.62s - 2472.02s |  okay awesome we have someone that solved the whole thing who is chi chesum right there
2472.98s - 2477.94s |  all right oh nice well you can come back up and get uh a challenge coin
2478.66s - 2481.78s |  do you have one who's oh where's knob knob goose knob knob goose is here
2482.34s - 2489.06s |  another name i recognize knob knob goose isn't here is are they just hacked in all right
2489.06s - 2493.86s |  knob knob goose you can come get a challenge called santa montes shunt derek delta if you
2493.86s - 2499.86s |  have solves on defcon academy run up get a challenge coin in the meantime
2500.66s - 2506.74s |  thank you for uh coming to this soft launch preview of defcon academy um
2508.02s - 2517.30s |  that started from the beginning we'll just fast forward here two minutes that's two more minutes
2517.30s - 2526.90s |  than we need my friend all right awesome so defcon academy wouldn't exist if it wasn't for
2527.78s - 2534.34s |  the awesome efforts of you all who dive into this educational stuff and make it worth it
2534.34s - 2539.86s |  and it wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the awesome efforts of the dark tangent
2539.86s - 2546.58s |  who supports these awesome sort of things and perry thank you because you your vision
2546.58s - 2555.94s |  made this actually possible you're welcome all right and all of these guys awesome thank you
2556.26s - 2558.82s |  and connor nelson and connor nelson
2561.38s - 2564.66s |  thank you hey you finished early
