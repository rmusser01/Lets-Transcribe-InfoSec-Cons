**Introduction to Satellite-Based Air Traffic Control Security**

- **Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Contract (ADS-C)**: A satellite-based aviation datalink application for monitoring aircraft in remote regions.
- **ADS-B vs. ADS-C**: ADS-C is crucial where ADS-B lacks connectivity, especially in remote areas like oceans or mountainous regions.

**Overview of ADS-C**

- **History and Impact**: Although conceived over 30 years ago, ADS-C's security has been largely unexplored.
- **Technical Details**: ADS-C lacks authentication, making it vulnerable to attacks.
- **ADS-C Message Analysis**: Over 120,000 real-world ADS-C messages were analyzed using software-defined radio receivers.

**Vulnerabilities in ADS-C**

- **Lack of Authentication**: Allows generating and sending arbitrary ADS-C messages.
- **Protocol Weaknesses**: Vulnerabilities range from passively tracking aircraft to actively altering aircraft positions via downlink and uplink attacks.

**ADS-B and Satellite Security**

- **Satellite-Based ADS-B**: Mirrors terrestrial vulnerabilities; companies claim it's secure due to satellite distance, but it’s an engineering challenge to overcome.
- **Security Myths**: Space-based ADS-B is not inherently secure, and theoretical attacks are possible despite regulatory limitations.

**ADS-C Functionality**

- **Data Transmission**: ADS-C transmits aircraft position, altitude, speed, and more to ground stations.
- **Satellite Communication**: Uses geostationary or LEO satellites to relay information to air navigation service providers.

**Importance of ADS-C**

- **Remote Monitoring**: Essential for monitoring aircraft over remote areas without terrestrial surveillance.
- **Efficient Airspace Utilization**: Enables reduced reliance on traditional voice communication and better airspace management.

**Security Analysis of ADS-C**

- **System and Threat Models**: Involves satellites, ground stations, and aircraft stations, with potential eavesdroppers and active attackers.
- **Eavesdropping**: Allows reconnaissance on aircraft by tracking their positions and identifiers.
- **Active Attacks**: Can lead to denial of service or spoofing of aircraft positions.

**Practical Insights and Testing**

- **Receiver Setup**: Utilized software-defined radios and antennas for downlink and uplink message reception.
- **Message Injection**: Demonstrated the ability to inject arbitrary ADS-C messages, highlighting security flaws.

**Conclusion**

- **Security Concerns**: ADS-C lacks authentication, allowing both passive and active attacks.
- **Ease of Setup**: Setting up attack systems is straightforward and cost-effective, posing a significant security threat.
- **Future Talks and Papers**: Additional discussions on signal injection and related security issues are scheduled at upcoming conferences.
