  "description": "I conducted thorough research on a corporate banking software widely utilized by numerous banks globally. This research was conducted during a bug bounty program for a leading bank in middle east, which employs this software. By examining their marketing brochures, we identified the third party company responsible for its development and after looking at their client we found out, their software is utilized by 60-70% of banks worldwide.\n\nIn this talk i will explain how did i recon corporate banking application from extracting interesting endpoints and methods. Further used them to find attack surface. Furthermore, I will delve into the methods used to uncover critical vulnerabilities within their application, including SQL injections, bypassing access control mechanisms etc.",

 Alright, I would like you all to give me a put your hands together and welcome to the stage our next presenters
7.00s - 9.00s |  Nick's and
9.96s - 11.96s |  Charlie I am so sorry
17.34s - 24.10s |  Hey, yeah, so today we are talking about hacking corporate banking for fun and profit so
26.34s - 30.46s |  Introducing myself, I'm a full-time bug bounty hunter for for SNAK
31.18s - 37.38s |  I also recognized in 2021 as and as one of their liaison hacker and
38.50s - 40.50s |  I will sorry
40.58s - 42.02s |  Okay
42.02s - 46.02s |  I'm also I'm also founder of besides and about and
47.18s - 50.14s |  I am advisor at risk profiler dot IO
51.66s - 53.58s |  Hey guys, my name is Charlie waterhouse
53.58s - 59.62s |  I am a security analyst and was on the back side of this helping triage these phones as they came in and we kind of
59.62s - 66.06s |  Work together to go a little further and figure out some stuff on this. I have spent non-traditional and pin testing background
66.06s - 73.22s |  I spent 22 years as an airline flight attendant international manager and speaker and translator in the meantime, though
73.22s - 77.94s |  I've also done over 2,400 engagements based on a wasp and reviewed about
78.50s - 83.34s |  25 30,000 reports from a lot some of you guys out here that have seen me on the back end of that
83.78s - 87.78s |  I work with a lot of our large corporate clients to help them understand the flaws
88.30s - 94.34s |  And as I like to say translate the geek side to non-geek so that the guys who would not technical understand what we're looking at
96.30s - 99.54s |  So to start we're gonna give you guys a little bit about this
100.66s - 106.22s |  During the bounty hunt on this we were kind of looking at this was a private program for a large large bank
107.14s - 112.78s |  And the scope was our corporate banking application. This is the back end where they're doing transfers and setting up stuff
113.90s - 115.74s |  after exploring a bit
115.74s - 121.02s |  We found that there was a third-party application that was running and claim to be used by 60% of the bank
121.02s - 123.46s |  So this was like, okay now we can start digging a little more
123.90s - 130.45s |  The program has three roles. We have a maker verifier and checker the maker initiates a transaction
130.73s - 133.29s |  The checker ensures everything's in place and ready to go
133.65s - 137.77s |  Verifier is the final checkbox and so the app has corporate groups
137.77s - 143.17s |  Each was managed by different branches and they're all separate not linked to each other recognized by GCIF now
143.53s - 146.25s |  One of the things we found out from my end when we started looking
146.85s - 154.01s |  Louder louder always. Okay. So when we started looking we found that the GCIF is actually kind of a unique thing
154.01s - 159.65s |  I we started poking around. This is a Google patent for linking your bank accounts together
159.93s - 162.37s |  So let's say that you have a large corporate bank
162.37s - 166.45s |  You have a loan that's for your house for your car for your bank for your credit cards
166.53s - 172.61s |  They're all linked you through your GCIF. So it's your universal identifier across different divisions within the same bank
173.29s - 176.25s |  so let's keep that in mind when we're going through this and
177.17s - 180.49s |  Next slide so we can see what each role looks like with the maker
180.93s - 185.53s |  The verifier and the authorizer these are pretty standard and look pretty similar
186.13s - 187.77s |  So at this point
187.77s - 189.77s |  Nix you want to take it over where you were at on this?
191.29s - 192.81s |  Yeah, so
192.81s - 194.81s |  So client has given some
195.25s - 200.65s |  SLA's when they are going to fix all these vulnerabilities. So starting from critical
201.25s - 205.45s |  Which which is which has been given that they will fix in like 15 days
206.89s - 209.77s |  High up to 30 days medium up to 90 days
209.77s - 218.48s |  But they they never followed it and they fix all the vulnerabilities after one year. So
221.24s - 227.52s |  So getting to know the application it's using servlets kind of a single-page app which we tend to kind of go in how much there
228.56s - 230.76s |  The maker role has administration
231.32s - 237.16s |  Application module on it and so we're kind of noted that and that each role has custom permissions
237.64s - 239.64s |  But the maker role does have that admin
240.16s - 242.64s |  But it doesn't have all the admin purposes permissions
243.64s - 245.64s |  There's a servlet path for the front office
246.04s - 248.04s |  That we see here and the admin path
248.32s - 254.00s |  what we kind of want to focus on though is these widget IDs and the event IDs because these are going to come critical as
254.00s - 256.36s |  We go through and we're going to use them through those
256.64s - 263.28s |  Modifiers several pages with keywords that we saw with that event ID and then we had the modifiers to go in with it
263.28s - 268.36s |  And then the front office was in the web portal spot and input validation was required to get in
271.80s - 277.80s |  So there was there was two sides of it this application one is a front-end and the other is the back-end
278.16s - 282.24s |  Back-end is not really a back-end, but they have given custom permissions on it
283.24s - 290.08s |  It is kind of very large application, so they haven't provided much much of like
290.80s - 292.80s |  permissions on it
292.80s - 294.48s |  so
294.48s - 300.08s |  So when there was a demo, sorry, so so I started recon on the application
300.08s - 306.50s |  I found that they are running a third-party application and this third-party application was a
307.20s - 310.56s |  demo only so I couldn't find much information available on the
310.80s - 313.00s |  And I don't want to call them and
313.84s - 316.24s |  Have a demo setup for myself
316.96s - 321.76s |  So I go ahead and decided to review their JavaScript files
323.00s - 325.00s |  JavaScript so basically
325.00s - 332.12s |  This application has two event IDs as to two parameters event IDs and widget widget IDs
332.52s - 339.00s |  So what I did I and and there was there was one more parameter GC GC
339.00s - 345.68s |  If which Charlie just explains that is used to I need I identify the bank customer all across the world
345.88s - 347.88s |  so what I did I
348.04s - 350.04s |  used a graphic script to
350.56s - 357.00s |  Figure out all the event IDs because what happened is if you want to serve any functionality in this application
357.00s - 359.00s |  You have to change the event IDs
359.64s - 362.12s |  in the in the parameter and you will get
363.00s - 366.34s |  If you if you have access to that particular functionality you will
367.34s - 370.18s |  Able to load it. So what I did I just
371.18s - 373.38s |  grab all the event IDs
373.94s - 375.94s |  through through a graphic script and
377.62s - 383.58s |  And and each there was like common.js file, but
384.10s - 389.46s |  In each page you load the event IDs you will get a new
390.86s - 394.70s |  JavaScript file and it has a it will contain a new
395.38s - 400.98s |  Event IDs for next for maybe for the next functionalities. So
401.82s - 403.66s |  so this is like
403.66s - 409.58s |  this is like a few event IDs that I found from just just to start from and
410.02s - 417.22s |  After I after I go load these event IDs in the application. I found like more than
417.90s - 419.26s |  500
419.26s - 421.26s |  modules running on this application
422.10s - 424.65s |  so
425.09s - 427.33s |  Starting from the our first findings
428.01s - 429.17s |  so
429.17s - 431.17s |  It's an acceleration from
431.29s - 436.69s |  Authorizer to admin role. So what they are doing that the maker role has admin button
436.69s - 442.17s |  So when when I click the admin button, it will redirect me to the admin admin panel of it
442.21s - 446.45s |  But the admin panel also do not have much permissions available
446.81s - 450.37s |  Just a couple of couple of modules are loading
450.57s - 455.09s |  So what so when I click click the click that
455.73s - 463.33s |  admin role what I found that they are generating they are basically checking that if this role has
463.77s - 466.85s |  dual dual code dual role available on their
467.41s - 469.25s |  on their
469.25s - 471.09s |  on their
471.09s - 475.77s |  Privilege, I mean on their like like if I go through authorizer
475.77s - 481.93s |  It will check that if if this role has dual permissions available or not
482.25s - 487.69s |  if dual permissions are available, it will assign that admin panel to me, so
488.85s - 493.05s |  what I did I just load this URL from from the
494.09s - 496.25s |  from the authorizer role and
497.05s - 502.93s |  It will allow me access to the admin panel, but there was no module was loading
502.93s - 507.65s |  There was just they were just maybe just hiding the modules
509.05s - 513.05s |  From the admin application. So what I did I just use the event IDs
513.61s - 520.25s |  Put the event IDs in in the parameter and try to load try to load different modules
521.21s - 523.21s |  from this generated
524.25s - 530.17s |  Administration from the authorizer role, so I did it one by one from the
531.17s - 533.37s |  Starting from the user list report, so
534.93s - 536.93s |  When I when I load the event IDs
537.21s - 540.37s |  I found that the page is
541.77s - 547.57s |  Template page is loading and while clicking on submit. I was able to access all their
548.25s - 550.89s |  user from the from an authorizer role
552.37s - 553.73s |  So
553.73s - 559.49s |  Using those event IDs and there are some frames URLs as well. So the frame see wires are connecting
560.33s - 562.77s |  connecting to the event IDs only so
565.65s - 572.01s |  Whatever you load even the even the frames or event IDs you will get the same information and
573.21s - 577.33s |  Just by loading one by one event IDs. You will actually able to
577.93s - 587.47s |  Access all of their admin panel from an authorizer or verifier role. So it was just hiding hiding the hiding the
588.47s - 594.79s |  Modules not actually authorizing the user for that particular role
595.79s - 596.99s |  so
596.99s - 599.91s |  This is the this is the second finding. I found like
600.79s - 603.87s |  This is again. I'm I was using
606.11s - 608.11s |  Event IDs to load up
608.55s - 610.47s |  to load a particular
610.47s - 613.51s |  particular function, so what I did I
614.39s - 618.79s |  Using this GS link finder I caught up with a particular page
619.51s - 625.83s |  limit setup main page dot GSP and when I load this page, I was actually able to
626.71s - 628.19s |  get a
628.19s - 629.95s |  get a
629.95s - 633.67s |  Get a page where I was able to set up their
634.83s - 636.47s |  customers
636.47s - 642.83s |  Whatever whatever withdrawal or whatever daily limit they want to set for each customer. So
643.51s - 645.15s |  I can set it for
645.15s - 649.75s |  They are all customers as well. So once I click and
650.59s - 652.59s |  approve this
653.23s - 655.23s |  They just simply
655.31s - 658.45s |  Set up their limit to all the all the customers they have
666.36s - 670.92s |  Yeah last minute prep, sorry guys, it's to mean it's supposed to be a very surprised cat there
672.48s - 676.30s |  So, yeah, so
676.66s - 680.62s |  So when when I so there was another under part of this
681.30s - 688.14s |  This functionality that I didn't didn't tell you that when you once you submit the submit the
689.66s - 692.18s |  Submit any request it will actually go to the
692.78s - 698.78s |  Go to as authorizer. So you have to authorize that request in order to get it approved. So
699.54s - 703.10s |  So these IDs are these event IDs are quite simple
703.10s - 708.38s |  so as you say as you can see if you want to leave any page or modify any page or
709.10s - 714.46s |  Authorize any page you just have to modify a simple value like view modify or
714.98s - 721.46s |  and just just have to just have to alter those values to set set this up and
722.86s - 724.86s |  once once you load this
725.46s - 727.46s |  let's say you modify something and
727.98s - 733.42s |  You end up in authorization page and you just have to modify the auth ID and
733.70s - 739.18s |  Once you are once you go to the auth ID you will you will have to do I mean they display
739.78s - 746.70s |  The value you just modified you just have to authorize that value to have it set up for all the users
747.26s - 749.26s |  so
749.74s - 751.62s |  So
751.62s - 754.78s |  Since I since I modified a value from here
755.06s - 761.18s |  I just modify I just go to the authorization page and there was a request pending that
762.06s - 763.22s |  that
763.22s - 768.78s |  This this particular thing is modified. You just have to authorize it or unauthorized unauthorized
768.78s - 773.46s |  so just for since since it it was client application, and I don't want to
774.46s - 775.94s |  impact it much
775.94s - 781.74s |  so I just use the unauthorized button to simply reject the request which I just
782.10s - 789.78s |  Sent for modification since it was for all the customers. So just just for a safer side. Maybe they are using a
790.42s - 791.78s |  broad
791.78s - 793.02s |  behind
793.02s - 796.62s |  And showing us this is a staging environment only
798.54s - 805.22s |  So so from from from authorized page, I just click on the authorizer ID which was
805.78s - 808.26s |  which was which I just modified and
809.10s - 810.70s |  On this page
810.70s - 812.70s |  There was two two things
812.70s - 819.10s |  Authorize reject you if you if you authorize it will set up for all the cost all the all their customers if you reject
819.10s - 823.94s |  It will instantly reject and do not modify the those limits to all the customers
824.44s - 828.02s |  So I just rejected it and and simply got rejected
829.06s - 830.22s |  so
830.22s - 832.22s |  in the finding three the
832.34s - 835.14s |  It was a customer onboarding ID or
835.90s - 839.06s |  Again it was it was through the event IDs only and
839.94s - 843.74s |  I found an interesting event IDs from the from the JS that
844.74s - 848.62s |  customer set of view page, so I thought I thought I
849.26s - 853.58s |  Might I might be able to I might be able to set up the customer
854.34s - 859.50s |  customers information from this page, so what I did I just go to the
859.54s - 861.94s |  So what I did I just go to the
862.98s - 869.06s |  servlet and I modified the event IDs to customer set it set up view main page and
869.70s - 871.54s |  what I and
871.54s - 873.54s |  there was and
873.54s - 877.38s |  When when I loaded it was actually loading that customers
878.82s - 880.82s |  customers in information and
882.42s - 884.82s |  There was there was one more button that is
885.18s - 892.26s |  Action if you if you want to modify modify or thrice or something you can use action or either you can just mode
892.26s - 894.46s |  do you just put the value in the
895.18s - 900.90s |  Event IDs itself so once you once you get once you got the event
901.22s - 906.02s |  once you got the that customer did you you just have to click on it and
907.86s - 909.58s |  And
909.62s - 914.66s |  You can you can modify whatever the group name or you can even
915.98s - 917.98s |  remove the remove the
918.58s - 922.74s |  corporate ID from from that particular customer so once you remove the
923.42s - 928.66s |  corporate ID that from that customer actually all their accounts could get unlinked and
929.94s - 936.78s |  They they're even their customers do not have do not able to access their account informations
937.34s - 943.20s |  so
943.20s - 949.88s |  Well, well, so again once I once I submit this request I have to authorize this
950.20s - 952.20s |  so I just modified the
953.00s - 956.40s |  Event ID to auth page and once I go there
956.40s - 963.00s |  I just have to authorize or reject this in order to approve it for that dot that particular customer
963.36s - 966.83s |  so while while while
967.51s - 971.79s |  While doing this all of all of this. I also found found that
972.79s - 977.55s |  The customer setup page was also vulnerable to accesses
977.67s - 982.47s |  so what I did I just put the put the access payload in their
983.51s - 985.51s |  their
985.79s - 987.43s |  Relationship manager
987.43s - 989.07s |  name and
989.07s - 993.87s |  Whenever they see the relationship manager name on their bank
994.87s - 996.19s |  bank
996.19s - 1000.59s |  Account the the accesses payload will pop up and I can
1001.11s - 1004.75s |  able to grab their cookies just from just straight from their
1005.43s - 1006.59s |  their
1006.59s - 1008.59s |  bank bank account
1008.75s - 1013.53s |  so
1014.53s - 1016.53s |  So the as I said
1016.53s - 1023.37s |  There was a there was two side of this application one is for the front front office and one is the back office
1023.77s - 1025.77s |  the front office
1025.81s - 1032.13s |  Contains the widget widget servlet and the back of back office contains
1033.37s - 1035.37s |  contains the
1035.81s - 1038.33s |  Another another servlet, so
1039.73s - 1045.05s |  So what I did I just I just sort all the widget controller and
1045.57s - 1047.81s |  try I start fudging for
1048.81s - 1051.97s |  SQL SQL injection vulnerabilities, but I found that
1052.97s - 1056.61s |  There was one parameter that is called the DIR
1056.81s - 1061.45s |  It was giving me 500 internal server error while supplying a single single code
1061.57s - 1063.45s |  so I
1063.45s - 1067.45s |  So I thought I mean there was a change in response
1067.45s - 1071.05s |  So I thought let's try some Boolean and blind conditions
1071.21s - 1077.17s |  so when I try when I started fuzzing for Boolean and blind based I found that
1078.01s - 1084.77s |  There was a Boolean based blind is working and the database is Oracle and I
1085.37s - 1091.89s |  I just I just use a SQL map to dump all their all their databases and I
1092.09s - 1095.81s |  Was able to fuzz I was able to get all of their
1096.85s - 1099.09s |  all of their database systems
1101.52s - 1103.16s |  so
1103.16s - 1110.40s |  Since since I was able to since I was able to escalate the escalate the authorizer or very very fire rolled in the
1110.80s - 1114.56s |  admin panel, so I just used an authorizer role and
1115.52s - 1121.20s |  I tried to weave the customer customer we've set a customer set of view page and
1121.68s - 1127.80s |  I found that the customer name and content customer and customer underscore name was vulnerable to
1128.40s - 1130.40s |  again Boolean based blind and
1131.08s - 1133.52s |  What I do I just went ahead and
1134.88s - 1141.32s |  Started started the SQL map on it and I was able to dump all their DB again
1142.96s - 1148.40s |  So I got like I said like this was fun and profit
1148.40s - 1153.04s |  So I got all the fun and I got all of profits as well
1155.16s - 1156.44s |  So
1156.44s - 1160.64s |  So later after an year they come and they said that
1162.28s - 1164.40s |  We have fixed all the issues
1164.52s - 1171.04s |  so what they did they just removed the corporate admin power module from the application and they think that it's
1171.48s - 1173.48s |  fixed from their side and
1173.76s - 1180.76s |  on the on the on the front end they they come after another one year and they put the
1181.24s - 1182.76s |  cloud fear
1182.76s - 1189.75s |  Across their application and they think that it's fixed again. So that's
1190.95s - 1196.55s |  Yeah, so looking at it from my end from the triage in you have to ask what the clients always ask us
1196.55s - 1202.43s |  What what it's matter if you come in you do a cross-site scripting you pop a alert that just says one
1203.07s - 1208.27s |  The CEO is gonna go. Okay, what we had to kind of go in and explain to him is not only do we
1208.99s - 1213.99s |  Manage to have almost full admin access from any role across your system
1214.23s - 1218.91s |  we managed to also dump your entire SQL database and showed them a row in a column that we pulled and
1219.31s - 1225.15s |  So we can also take care of that and then in addition anybody who has a relationship manager listed
1225.15s - 1228.79s |  I can now get their creds. That's all his high-value clients
1229.51s - 1233.75s |  When we see these relationship managers in our banking app, imagine that just stole your ID
1234.35s - 1236.83s |  That's where they start coming in and they go. Oh
1237.83s - 1242.63s |  And yeah, that's when you want to be that guy going this is what I found you
1243.15s - 1245.95s |  And so getting their attention with this when they see it
1245.95s - 1250.83s |  They were paying a lot of attention once they saw clearly what the impact was that basically
1251.39s - 1253.39s |  Nix ran roughshod over him
1253.95s - 1258.39s |  So yeah, that's kind of what we're looking at with bad session management
1258.87s - 1260.07s |  so
1260.07s - 1262.07s |  Anything else add next?
1262.07s - 1267.91s |  That's all for a month. All right. Thank you guys. Hopefully this was kind of informative and you guys learned something
