0.00s - 4.46s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Good morning, everyone. Welcome, DEF CON.
4.46s - 9.16s |  Thank you all for being here so early in the morning with me.
9.16s - 10.86s |  This talk is Porn and Privacy.
10.86s - 14.06s |  Hopefully, you're in the right room.
14.06s - 18.26s |  I do have to start because my time has already started,
18.26s - 21.26s |  and I have to be done by a certain time.
21.26s - 24.50s |  So I know some of you are still joining in,
24.50s - 30.60s |  and I have to get started.
30.60s - 33.40s |  Who am I? My name is Edna Johnson.
33.40s - 34.74s |  I also go by ET.
34.74s - 37.00s |  I use they, them pronouns.
37.00s - 39.00s |  I'm a cybersecurity professional
39.00s - 42.20s |  as well as a master's degree student.
42.20s - 46.06s |  I compete in OSINT CTF competitions,
46.06s - 50.04s |  and I advise my friends on digital safety.
50.04s - 53.40s |  I do want to give a content warning for this talk.
53.44s - 56.70s |  I'm going to be talking about subjects that may be triggering,
56.70s - 61.00s |  and if you do have any triggers regarding these issues,
61.00s - 63.04s |  I will happily share this information
63.04s - 64.80s |  with you at a later time.
64.80s - 66.86s |  But I'm going to be talking about nonconsensual
66.86s - 70.16s |  intimate image abuse or revenge porn,
70.16s - 75.45s |  deep fakes, and sextortion.
75.45s - 77.05s |  And I want to give a disclaimer
77.05s - 79.13s |  that as a cybersecurity professional,
79.13s - 82.15s |  I am here sharing my technical knowledge
82.15s - 83.93s |  to make your digital life safer,
83.93s - 85.19s |  and it is important to note
85.19s - 87.53s |  that I'm not a mental health professional.
87.53s - 89.59s |  While I'm here to provide guidance
89.59s - 92.47s |  on matters that affect your personal lives,
92.47s - 95.27s |  I am not equipped to offer mental health assistance.
95.27s - 98.73s |  So if needed, I do encourage you to seek help
98.73s - 103.47s |  from an appropriately trained mental health profession.
103.47s - 105.73s |  Our roadmap today is I'm going to be going over
105.73s - 109.69s |  some obscenity laws that are being passed in states.
109.69s - 113.15s |  I'm going to cover NCIIA,
113.15s - 117.03s |  nonconsensual intimate image abuse or revenge porn.
117.03s - 120.49s |  We're going to go over some deep fake,
120.49s - 123.09s |  and then we're going to go over how to minimize the risk
123.09s - 125.39s |  of images being abused online.
125.39s - 127.73s |  And if they have been abused,
127.73s - 135.70s |  how to recover from those images when they've been leaked.
135.70s - 138.90s |  So the first thing is the obscenity laws.
138.94s - 144.14s |  States all have been passing laws
144.14s - 150.34s |  where they're requiring you to upload your government ID
150.34s - 152.40s |  to be able to access adult content
152.40s - 154.84s |  or pornographic material.
154.84s - 161.26s |  And so Pornhub, for example, has been blocking states
161.26s - 165.14s |  from being able to access their website
165.14s - 168.54s |  because of these laws, because of the privacy implications
168.54s - 170.08s |  that it contains.
170.08s - 174.98s |  So if you're coming from any of these eight states currently,
174.98s - 180.04s |  that is Utah, North Carolina, Texas, and others,
180.04s - 181.90s |  you'll get a message from Pornhub showing you
181.90s - 186.90s |  that says basically, dear user,
186.90s - 189.74s |  if you're visiting from these states,
189.74s - 193.58s |  your government officials have this requirement
193.58s - 195.38s |  to show your ID.
195.38s - 202.24s |  And that is tying your porn habits to your actual identity.
202.24s - 207.64s |  And thank you.
207.64s - 210.52s |  So that is a privacy concern.
210.52s - 214.92s |  Okay. Yeah, that works.
214.92s - 216.12s |  Okay, thank you.
216.12s - 218.78s |  Sorry about that.
218.78s - 223.78s |  All right, so these eight states have already passed these laws,
223.82s - 225.68s |  and they're in effect currently.
225.68s - 229.98s |  And so when people are accessing porn from these sites,
229.98s - 232.18s |  they're either needing to use a VPN
232.18s - 240.19s |  to access porn providers that are blocking the site
240.19s - 245.79s |  or they have providers that aren't as,
245.79s - 247.39s |  you know, compliant with laws.
247.39s - 251.55s |  And so those might be a little more sketchy websites.
251.55s - 253.43s |  More states are currently passing these laws,
253.43s - 258.63s |  such as Florida just had this law go in effect on July 1st.
258.63s - 260.67s |  And these laws are typically packaged
260.67s - 264.79s |  with some kind of a child protection,
264.79s - 267.79s |  internet protection bill.
267.79s - 272.37s |  So, for example, in Florida, they have now provided a law
272.37s - 277.29s |  that gives a minimum age for kids to use social media.
277.29s - 289.86s |  And so they tied that in with this adult material block.
289.86s - 292.32s |  Thank you.
292.32s - 294.20s |  So I'm going to go over some basics
294.20s - 296.32s |  regarding interdigital privacy.
296.32s - 299.10s |  And a lot of you, most of you probably already know this,
299.10s - 300.26s |  but I want to make sure we all have
300.26s - 302.72s |  the same fundamental knowledge.
302.72s - 305.60s |  So digital privacy refers to the protection
305.60s - 309.36s |  of private citizens' online information.
309.36s - 312.96s |  So that can be companies collecting information on users,
312.96s - 314.46s |  visiting websites,
314.46s - 319.60s |  or it can be you're sharing information on social media.
319.60s - 321.00s |  All of our activities online
321.00s - 322.76s |  are going to leave a digital footprint,
322.76s - 327.40s |  and that information can be used to help identify us.
327.40s - 331.16s |  Personal Identifiable Information, PII,
331.16s - 335.12s |  is information connected to a specific individual
335.12s - 338.16s |  that can be used to uncover their individual identity,
338.16s - 340.30s |  such as social security number,
340.30s - 345.40s |  full name, email address, and phone number.
345.40s - 348.50s |  Make sure you're using strong account security basics.
348.50s - 351.76s |  So the basics are necessary.
351.76s - 355.30s |  And first, make sure you have strong passwords
355.30s - 360.00s |  so you can accomplish that by using passphrases,
360.00s - 365.62s |  using at least 10 or more characters in your password.
365.66s - 368.86s |  Use multiple character types, such as numbers,
368.86s - 372.22s |  special characters, upper and lowercase letters.
372.22s - 374.42s |  And then use a password manager
374.42s - 376.52s |  to manage all of those passwords,
376.52s - 379.06s |  and examples include bit warning,
379.06s - 382.66s |  key pass, and one password.
382.66s - 386.16s |  Additionally, I recommend using a two-factor authentication
386.16s - 389.02s |  or a multi-factor application,
389.02s - 392.66s |  and those could be SMS or text messages,
392.66s - 395.46s |  applications such as Google Authenticator,
395.46s - 398.66s |  Microsoft Authenticator, Duo, and more.
398.66s - 404.02s |  Or you can use a hardware token such as YubiKey
404.02s - 405.42s |  for your security hygiene.
405.42s - 410.94s |  So if you're creating accounts on adult websites,
410.94s - 412.98s |  try to limit the personal information
412.98s - 417.48s |  and keep personal information off of those spicy websites.
417.48s - 419.34s |  Limit the information that you share
419.34s - 421.82s |  that could be used to identify you,
421.82s - 425.44s |  and I recommend using separate email addresses for activities
425.50s - 429.20s |  so you could have an email account
429.20s - 430.94s |  for your personal accounts.
430.94s - 434.64s |  So if you're emailing your dad and things like that,
434.64s - 437.00s |  a different email address for your banking,
437.00s - 441.34s |  and then an email account for your spicy websites,
441.34s - 443.70s |  your adult content websites.
443.70s - 446.70s |  That way, if any of those are compromised,
446.70s - 455.74s |  you're limiting the scope of damage that can happen.
455.78s - 458.60s |  OSINT or open-source intelligence,
458.60s - 462.34s |  that is the searching for and analyzing information
462.34s - 463.64s |  that is publicly available
463.64s - 467.30s |  and meant to produce actionable intelligence,
467.30s - 470.10s |  and that can be found using public records,
470.10s - 475.14s |  images or videos online by finding it on websites
475.14s - 479.14s |  or social media platforms or more.
479.14s - 484.98s |  All right, nonconsensual intimate image abuse, NCIIA.
484.98s - 487.72s |  Also known as revenge porn.
487.72s - 490.02s |  So nonconsensual intimate image abuse
490.02s - 494.92s |  is the distribution of sexually graphic images
494.92s - 498.08s |  of individuals without their consent.
498.08s - 503.42s |  This includes images originally obtained without consent
503.42s - 506.68s |  as well as images originally obtained with consent,
506.68s - 510.38s |  and this is usually in the context of a private
510.38s - 512.48s |  or a confidential relationship.
515.44s - 517.44s |  When you've been compromised
517.44s - 520.44s |  or your images have been leaked online,
520.44s - 523.18s |  you might feel like something is off.
523.18s - 527.42s |  You could have an influx of friend requests on Facebook
527.42s - 530.28s |  or lots of new followers on Twitter
530.28s - 535.22s |  or your inboxes are overflowing all of a sudden.
535.22s - 539.08s |  So when you are finding yourself in that situation,
539.08s - 542.92s |  the first step is to do OSINT on yourself.
542.92s - 546.26s |  You may want to find a friend to help you with this
546.26s - 551.36s |  because it could be an emotional experience to go through.
551.36s - 553.32s |  When you do find information,
553.32s - 556.56s |  you want to make sure to do online hygiene
556.56s - 560.62s |  and do checkups to make sure that you don't have information
560.62s - 564.46s |  that could make things worse.
564.46s - 568.96s |  So you want to limit the information shared online,
568.96s - 570.86s |  and you got to know what's out there
570.86s - 577.27s |  before you can start to clean it up.
577.27s - 580.91s |  Some of you may know of Caitlin Bowden.
580.91s - 586.85s |  Caitlin had her images leaked online,
586.85s - 591.67s |  and those images were from...
591.67s - 594.05s |  She had been in a relationship,
594.05s - 597.41s |  and the images were on her ex's phone,
597.41s - 599.97s |  and it wasn't her ex that shared them out.
600.03s - 602.27s |  It was...
602.27s - 604.27s |  The phone got stolen,
604.27s - 609.61s |  and the phone did not have any passcode on it.
609.61s - 612.51s |  So some stranger shared out her images,
612.51s - 615.97s |  and she wanted me to let you know that offline access
615.97s - 619.47s |  is only as secure as the device it is on
619.47s - 622.17s |  and that these are very special pictures,
622.17s - 625.13s |  and so conversations matter.
625.13s - 627.41s |  So make sure you have conversations with the people
627.41s - 632.08s |  that you're sharing ahead of time.
632.14s - 634.48s |  So when you're sharing your intimate images,
634.48s - 637.94s |  have those conversations with your partner
637.94s - 642.02s |  or your spicy friend about the expectations of those images,
642.02s - 644.44s |  where they can store those images,
644.44s - 650.64s |  such as on the phone or computer, any other place,
650.64s - 652.52s |  even on the cloud.
652.52s - 657.44s |  Are they able to show those pictures to other people?
657.44s - 661.32s |  Is it something that they can send to anyone else,
661.32s - 665.06s |  and do you expect them to be deleted at any certain point,
665.06s - 666.98s |  such as when you break up,
666.98s - 673.22s |  so that they are no longer in your possession?
673.22s - 674.52s |  When you're sharing images,
674.52s - 677.66s |  you want to make sure that you're watermarking them,
677.66s - 683.12s |  and that is to put a word across the image,
683.12s - 686.66s |  and you can do that both by putting the location
686.66s - 688.32s |  where those images were shared,
688.32s - 691.32s |  such as OnlyFans or Discord.
691.36s - 695.26s |  You can also put their name or handle,
695.26s - 697.96s |  such as TooHotToHandle or Dave,
697.96s - 701.92s |  and you can hide those watermarks within the image
701.92s - 705.92s |  in dark spots, like in shadows, and make them small
705.92s - 707.92s |  so that they're not really visible,
707.92s - 710.22s |  but then if they are leaked later on,
710.22s - 713.46s |  you're able to find out who was the source of the leak
713.46s - 717.02s |  or what was the source of that leak.
717.02s - 719.92s |  A lot of platforms already remove EXIF data,
719.92s - 723.72s |  but it is a good idea to remove EXIF data from your images
723.72s - 728.02s |  so that they don't contain, for example, your geolocation,
728.02s - 732.16s |  and you can create an inventory of a list of images
732.16s - 738.32s |  that you do share out so that you can easily reference
738.32s - 740.78s |  where those images were shared from
740.78s - 742.38s |  and who they were shared to.
742.38s - 751.88s |  So when you do have an incident with images being shared out,
751.88s - 757.68s |  there is a website called StopNCII.org,
757.68s - 761.88s |  and with the images that have been leaked,
761.88s - 765.08s |  you can upload and create a case on that website,
765.08s - 768.74s |  and they will go through all the major platforms,
768.74s - 773.94s |  such as Facebook, Instagram, Pornhub, OnlyFans,
773.94s - 782.65s |  and they will help you to remove the images from those platforms.
782.65s - 786.15s |  You're also able to remove those images from Google searches.
786.15s - 790.65s |  So a lot of times when images have been released,
790.65s - 793.25s |  they will contain your personal information.
793.25s - 799.45s |  It gets added to the images,
799.55s - 803.55s |  and they'll include whatever personal information they have about you,
803.55s - 808.35s |  and so you can request Google to remove from the Google search results.
808.35s - 810.35s |  So if you're searching your name,
810.35s - 815.95s |  your images that are your personal, explicit, intimate images
815.95s - 821.80s |  are removed from the Google search results.
821.80s - 825.80s |  Another process that you can do is a DMCA request.
825.80s - 831.20s |  This is using copyright law to have images that belong to you
831.20s - 833.50s |  removed from websites.
833.50s - 837.40s |  The DMCA.com website does have a section
837.40s - 840.90s |  that helps you go through the steps
840.90s - 845.10s |  of removing revenge porn from the web,
845.10s - 850.06s |  and you can find that on their website.
850.06s - 851.76s |  All right, so AI.
851.76s - 857.86s |  So recently, AI has been exploding in popularity,
857.86s - 865.96s |  and they're being created tools to abuse images,
865.96s - 871.06s |  and so AI is going to be used to change the world
871.06s - 874.16s |  as a tool to make the world better, right?
874.16s - 877.86s |  As a tool to make the world better, right?
877.86s - 883.06s |  So there's been a lot of new apps
883.06s - 887.56s |  that are mostly targeting young men,
887.56s - 895.06s |  where you can change images to either put somebody into a bikini
895.06s - 897.26s |  or remove all of their clothing
897.26s - 902.06s |  or put somebody's face onto other images,
902.06s - 905.56s |  and these are being advertised on Instagram.
905.56s - 910.76s |  They're not in some dark corner, dark web marketplace.
910.76s - 914.26s |  They're out there,
914.26s - 917.96s |  and so new laws are needed to be passed.
917.96s - 920.36s |  There's states that have passed laws against this,
920.36s - 927.60s |  but more comprehensive laws are needed.
927.60s - 929.60s |  Five minutes? Okay.
929.60s - 933.10s |  All right, so tips for using OnlyFans.
933.10s - 936.80s |  When you create an account, set up a monthly charge.
936.80s - 938.20s |  Use a fake name.
938.20s - 941.00s |  Do not use your real name.
941.00s - 944.40s |  Create new social media accounts for advertising it.
944.40s - 946.80s |  Don't tie it to your existing accounts,
946.80s - 952.00s |  and fake publicly available location.
952.00s - 956.20s |  To lower the risk of foreign, regionally block your state.
956.20s - 958.90s |  So if you're from Florida, block Florida.
958.90s - 960.80s |  That way you don't have people from high school
960.80s - 963.40s |  finding your OnlyFans account.
963.40s - 966.30s |  Make sure to watermark your photos.
966.30s - 968.90s |  OnlyFans does have an easy block feature
968.90s - 971.10s |  that allows you to delete their content
971.10s - 974.90s |  after they've been downloaded,
974.90s - 978.10s |  and if there is a leak, OnlyFans actually owns the content
978.10s - 980.10s |  that you publish on their website,
980.10s - 985.90s |  so they will send their lawyers to do the DMCA notices for you.
985.90s - 988.90s |  Make sure that you enable two-factor authentication.
988.90s - 991.40s |  There's a huge problem with accounts
991.40s - 994.90s |  that have been taken over on OnlyFans
994.90s - 998.10s |  where they set up two-factor for you,
998.10s - 1002.30s |  but they do have a support for getting control of it.
1002.30s - 1006.40s |  You have to contact OnlyFans to be able to get your account back
1006.40s - 1011.60s |  after it's been taken over by somebody else.
1011.60s - 1013.90s |  Catfishing tips.
1013.90s - 1016.20s |  So if you think you've been catfished,
1016.20s - 1021.00s |  use reverse image search to look up the pictures.
1021.00s - 1023.70s |  You may find that there's loads of other accounts
1023.70s - 1026.20s |  with many different names.
1026.20s - 1029.00s |  You can use Canary tokens or Grabify
1029.00s - 1032.00s |  to find out what their IP address is.
1032.00s - 1035.30s |  Try to verify the identity early on.
1035.30s - 1039.00s |  You can do that by doing a video call
1039.00s - 1041.00s |  or getting them to take a photo
1041.00s - 1045.40s |  with a specific sign or symbol that you request,
1045.40s - 1048.30s |  and make sure to take things slow in an online relationship
1048.30s - 1052.40s |  and don't send money to somebody you've never met.
1052.40s - 1054.90s |  Sextortion is a form of blackmail
1054.90s - 1058.50s |  where someone threatens to share a nude or sexual image
1058.50s - 1061.70s |  or video of you unless you give in to their demands.
1061.70s - 1065.40s |  It is illegal in most states, and if you pay a scammer once,
1065.40s - 1071.10s |  they will never leave you alone.
1071.10s - 1075.40s |  If you are being sextorted, do not give in to their demands
1075.40s - 1078.50s |  and all contact with the extorter immediately.
1078.50s - 1081.90s |  Turn off your social media accounts and LinkedIn accounts
1081.90s - 1085.60s |  and serve the blackmailer with a cease and desist notice,
1085.60s - 1091.50s |  and make sure to file a police report against the extorter.
1091.60s - 1095.10s |  Currently, states that have NCIA laws
1095.10s - 1099.60s |  are almost all of the states except for two.
1099.60s - 1103.60s |  States that have laws against extortion
1103.60s - 1107.50s |  is about half of the states in the United States currently,
1107.50s - 1112.40s |  and deepfake laws are in some of the states,
1112.40s - 1115.50s |  but it definitely needs to be improved on.
1115.50s - 1120.70s |  There is a new law going through Congress right now
1120.70s - 1125.80s |  regarding deepfakes, and we'll see how that goes through.

1138.10s - 1142.10s |  with support from cybersecurity professionals.
