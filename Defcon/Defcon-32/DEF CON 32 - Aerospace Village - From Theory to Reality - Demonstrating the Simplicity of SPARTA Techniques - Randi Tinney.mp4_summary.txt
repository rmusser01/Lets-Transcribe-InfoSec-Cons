**Introduction to SPARTA Techniques**  
- **Randi Tinney** represents the **Aerospace Corporation** discussing **SPARTA techniques**  
- Explains the simplicity and effectiveness of **SPARTA**  
- Background in **NASA's Independent Verification and Validation Center** and **Aerospace Corporation**  
- Roles include **exploit developer**, **vulnerability researcher**, and **website developer** for **SPARTA**  
- Part of the team that won the **Red Alert ICS CTF**  

**Overview of SPARTA**  
- **SPARTA**: A cybersecurity framework focused on **spacecraft** and **space-related systems**  
- Launched in **October 2022**  
- Similar to the **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** but specific to **space systems**  
- Intended for both **commercial** and **government users** to stay updated on attacks  

**Challenges in Space System Security**  
- Many attacks discussed are from a **tabletop perspective** due to classification  
- Difficulty in showing real-world attacks  
- Importance of simulated environments for understanding detection and blocking  

**Understanding Spacecraft Communication**  
- Simplified model: **Command and control server** sends commands to spacecraft  
- Components include **front-end processor**, **modem**, and optionally a **bulk crypto unit**  
- Communication flow: **Human readable** to **spacecraft communication** to **RF signal**  

**Potential Attack Vectors**  
- **Attack vector**: Focus on areas before the **bulk crypto unit**  
- Importance of securing **ground stations**, **command and control servers**, and **front-end processors**  
- Common industry misconceptions about system invulnerability  

**Demonstrating Attacks**  
- **Simple attacks** can be effective, such as **man-in-the-middle attacks** and **ARP spoofing**  
- **Sparta Cyber Exploiter**: A tool for **man-in-the-middle attacks**  
- Attacks demonstrated include **telemetry exfiltration**, **packet modification**, and **flooding**  

**Rogue Ground Station Attack**  
- Exploit **front-end processors** without authentication  
- Importance of **command and control database** in executing attacks  
- Combining attacks for more complex scenarios  

**Rogue Flight Application**  
- **Havoc**: A **backdoor** into **CFS** created by the **IBM JSTAR team**  
- Exploits **supply chain risks** by uploading malicious flight applications  
- Capabilities include **uploading files**, **downloading files**, and full **command access**  

**Summary and Countermeasures**  
- Importance of **defense in depth** to block attacks  
- Implement **bulk crypto units** and **space data link security** for improved security  
- **Sparta** includes descriptions of attacks and countermeasures  

**Conclusion**  
- Encouragement to adopt countermeasures and enhance security protocols  
- References to additional resources and talks on **Sparta and space system security**
