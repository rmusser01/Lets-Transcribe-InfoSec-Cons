 Okay, welcome everybody.
2.26s - 4.70s |  So if you're like me and you grew up with the Ninja Turtles,
4.70s - 6.70s |  you're gonna be really excited about this one.
6.70s - 10.94s |  We've got Daniel Eisler on behalf of Adversary Village,
10.94s - 13.78s |  Master Splinter's initial physical access dojo,
13.78s - 16.64s |  storytelling of Complex Adversarial.
16.64s - 24.26s |  Thanks so much and here we go.
24.26s - 27.00s |  Hi, maybe most of you don't know me.
27.00s - 31.96s |  And as you can see, I don't speak very well English.
32.08s - 35.12s |  So I hope you enjoy this talk.
35.12s - 38.26s |  Before I start, well, you already see it,
38.26s - 80.29s |  but it's important this very first announce.
80.29s - 83.25s |  Welcome, I am the Master Splinter.
83.25s - 86.53s |  And no, I'm not coming from the Comic-Con.
86.53s - 90.89s |  You can call me Rad, Splinter, Danny, or Daniel.
91.89s - 92.87s |  Oh, awesome.
92.87s - 93.73s |  Oh, hello, hello.
95.27s - 96.67s |  Okay.
96.67s - 97.51s |  Yeah, yeah.
98.49s - 103.11s |  Since 2015, I'm the team leader of Friendly Rats,
103.11s - 104.63s |  the social engineering unit
104.63s - 106.71s |  at DreamLab Technologies in Chile.
108.27s - 109.75s |  Friendly Rats, DreamLab.
110.91s - 113.19s |  I have the honor to present several cones.
113.19s - 115.51s |  I don't know if you, do you hear me?
115.51s - 116.59s |  No, not too much.
117.45s - 120.89s |  Yeah, I, okay, that's it.
122.69s - 125.47s |  Several cones associated with social engineering,
125.49s - 129.33s |  such as Ecoparty in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
130.59s - 133.33s |  Osintomatico in Madrid, in Spain,
133.33s - 136.23s |  Layer 8 in Rhode Island.
136.23s - 139.67s |  And with a lot of nervous and joy,
139.67s - 144.41s |  I will be, now is my fifth time presenting at DEF CON.
144.41s - 147.07s |  So thank you, Adversary Village.
148.65s - 153.35s |  Today, I'm gonna need the help of two volunteers
153.37s - 156.63s |  who wants to be real rats, ninja rats.
156.63s - 161.51s |  So to be more faster, I have,
161.51s - 164.15s |  no, no, but raise your hand, two persons.
164.15s - 167.03s |  I have one, two, okay.
167.03s - 168.47s |  Thank you, buddy.
168.47s - 170.47s |  No, no, but I will call you.
170.47s - 173.05s |  Thanks, thanks, don't go.
173.05s - 181.23s |  So welcome to the dojo.
181.23s - 183.53s |  Okay, all rats are welcome.
183.53s - 186.89s |  I could assure that everyone here
186.89s - 190.61s |  has social engineering success story.
190.61s - 192.51s |  I'm sure you'll treasure it,
194.17s - 197.85s |  even share it as an accomplishment or an adventure.
197.85s - 201.33s |  In fact, I love to hear that stories after this
201.33s - 203.41s |  with a beer, if you like.
203.41s - 208.17s |  Now, I invite you to imagine that, not the beer,
208.17s - 210.89s |  the story of social engineering.
210.89s - 215.69s |  And imagine that like a day job,
215.69s - 219.73s |  like us, Monday through Friday, all year long.
219.73s - 223.53s |  That's why our first adage will be,
223.53s - 226.73s |  there's no such a thing as luck.
226.73s - 230.29s |  I don't know if you can say that in Vegas,
230.29s - 233.05s |  but we don't trust in luck.
236.01s - 239.25s |  What I will try to do today is to share with you
239.25s - 242.65s |  how training, preparation, techniques and methods
242.65s - 246.41s |  can help in a social engineering service or in a red team.
246.41s - 250.49s |  So you can finally decide if luck really exists or not.
250.49s - 253.79s |  It's difficult to make an eye-catching story
253.79s - 258.69s |  when it has only existed in a report format.
258.69s - 261.89s |  As you will see, I will do my best.
263.41s - 267.73s |  So, it all starts in another country
267.73s - 272.73s |  with a critical infrastructure company of that nation.
273.11s - 275.37s |  We never expect to meet a client
275.37s - 278.45s |  who is really willing to give us a clue
279.45s - 282.05s |  as to what we are going to face.
282.05s - 285.93s |  He just point us to a few possible locations
285.93s - 287.65s |  where they might be found.
288.61s - 291.49s |  Control rooms, sorry, control rooms,
291.49s - 296.49s |  monitoring rooms, machine rooms, offices and data center.
298.17s - 303.17s |  One of the first thing we found in the assessment stage
304.81s - 309.81s |  was that due to the type of service this client provide,
310.41s - 313.99s |  in the case of any unusual activity
313.99s - 318.77s |  or unauthorized personnel, the collaborators,
318.77s - 323.09s |  any of them were authorized to reduce
323.09s - 325.89s |  or at least detain the intruder
325.89s - 329.87s |  until certain forces arrived.
333.49s - 336.89s |  We start the first week with information gathering,
336.89s - 343.14s |  focusing in the following three findings.
343.14s - 345.06s |  Corporate ID.
345.06s - 347.66s |  Thanks to a post in social networks,
347.66s - 352.66s |  we found a 3.2 feet long version of the corporate ID
352.94s - 356.96s |  with the personal ID of each of one of the developers.
358.38s - 361.74s |  The second one was relevant profiles
361.74s - 364.10s |  with exposed information.
364.10s - 369.10s |  We identified four strategic collaborators account
369.34s - 374.34s |  for identity impersonation and possible authorizations.
375.62s - 380.62s |  And the third one was weak accesses and credentials.
380.68s - 383.38s |  We found an internal login
383.38s - 385.86s |  without two-factor authentication
385.86s - 389.54s |  with the possibility of several consecutive attempts
389.54s - 392.00s |  to enter wrong credentials.
392.00s - 396.94s |  So maybe some, you know what happened with that.
398.06s - 400.74s |  The human, humans, sorry.
401.62s - 406.62s |  At this stage, it's very important to consider
407.18s - 411.22s |  as burned the rat performing the interaction
411.22s - 413.98s |  in the field for information gathering.
413.98s - 417.22s |  He can't be part of the physical intrusion
417.22s - 421.14s |  because collaborators could recognize him or her.
422.54s - 426.66s |  This phase allows us to achieve two findings.
426.66s - 431.30s |  First, the ID and the uniform design.
431.30s - 434.22s |  We validated the design was the same
434.22s - 438.98s |  as the one we found in the publication in the post.
438.98s - 442.14s |  Second one, we want to check
442.14s - 445.78s |  if indeed the attitude of the cats,
449.02s - 452.98s |  if one of us perform an inappropriate action.
452.98s - 457.98s |  So the burn rat took a picture of one of the accesses.
461.30s - 463.98s |  In less than two minutes,
463.98s - 466.74s |  he had one of the cats on his back,
466.74s - 468.50s |  almost breaking the camera
468.50s - 470.66s |  and demanding to delete the picture.
470.66s - 472.38s |  So it's gonna be tough.
474.10s - 476.22s |  How we organize in our unit?
477.26s - 479.66s |  To deal with any type of service,
479.66s - 481.60s |  we use the following distribution.
482.82s - 485.78s |  We have four kind of consultants.
485.78s - 490.22s |  Support, they are the ones who will immediately respond
490.22s - 493.02s |  to all the requests needed by the alpha team,
493.02s - 497.34s |  like information, supplies, mobilization,
497.34s - 499.66s |  buy some stuff, et cetera.
499.66s - 502.18s |  The Q, like the Q agent.
502.18s - 504.74s |  They are in charge for preparation devices,
504.74s - 509.74s |  payloads, scripts, Wi-Fi, malicious webpage, et cetera.
510.74s - 515.18s |  Then the alpha can be one or an alpha team.
515.18s - 518.14s |  There are experts in exploitation, execution,
518.14s - 520.94s |  capture, cloning and exfiltration,
520.94s - 524.10s |  recovery and access enabling.
524.10s - 528.10s |  And the last one, anyone here,
528.14s - 530.58s |  you could be one of these ones today.
531.86s - 533.38s |  Cover.
533.38s - 536.62s |  We work with freelance consultants,
536.62s - 541.62s |  from psychologists to actors, dogs to elderly people.
541.98s - 546.06s |  We use, one time my son used to work too,
546.06s - 547.18s |  with five years old.
548.46s - 550.90s |  The resorts are always good,
550.90s - 554.74s |  as they are not emotionally charged or stressed
554.74s - 556.72s |  about the success of the service.
557.72s - 561.08s |  The comments, their comments are usually,
561.08s - 564.12s |  this is the most fun I ever had,
564.12s - 569.12s |  or I wouldn't have imagined it will be so easy.
571.60s - 573.56s |  When they say that,
573.56s - 577.28s |  I start to see the hateful faces of the rats.
577.28s - 581.80s |  So I explained them that it looks easy,
581.80s - 584.80s |  thanks to the hard work of all the rats.
584.88s - 588.80s |  That's why they managed to get inside the data center,
588.80s - 593.44s |  manager's office or implant a device in a critical area.
593.44s - 596.30s |  So now you know our team.
597.44s - 601.16s |  So this was the plan or the organization.
601.16s - 603.48s |  The uniform used by the cats,
603.48s - 606.80s |  was not available for sale to public.
606.80s - 611.80s |  So our custom designer made her own research
613.08s - 614.48s |  to generate replicas.
615.16s - 617.08s |  So yes, we have a custom designer.
618.20s - 622.44s |  As you can see, it is necessary for the details,
622.44s - 627.44s |  including the natural aging and soiling of each uniform.
628.76s - 633.76s |  You can't always buy online or trust online stores.
636.92s - 640.96s |  This always happen when you buy online stores a uniform.
640.96s - 642.56s |  So don't do it.
643.44s - 645.48s |  Found a custom designer.
646.84s - 649.40s |  So what gonna do the Alpha team?
649.40s - 653.28s |  They gonna dress like a central office collaborator.
653.28s - 658.08s |  They will show up under the pretext of undertaking
658.08s - 662.88s |  a review of sanitization protocols
662.88s - 665.36s |  associated with COVID-19.
665.36s - 672.08s |  Of course, this project took place in that time.
672.12s - 673.56s |  Q.
673.56s - 676.80s |  During the second week, our Q guys
678.84s - 683.08s |  focus on four strategic profile email accounts.
683.08s - 688.08s |  Probably everyone is familiar with this kind of tools.
689.56s - 694.56s |  Who doesn't know, you can customize password dictionaries
694.68s - 697.52s |  for brute force attack.
697.52s - 702.52s |  So we achieve an effective access for four accounts
702.52s - 704.96s |  thanks to the low restrictions
704.96s - 706.88s |  on the weak password settings.
708.44s - 710.92s |  Those were the results.
710.92s - 715.92s |  So nothing very complex for these critical accounts.
717.83s - 720.23s |  What gonna make support?
720.23s - 723.35s |  Once inside of the email account,
723.35s - 726.51s |  we blacklist or spam all the people
726.51s - 728.75s |  where we are going to contact.
729.51s - 732.95s |  Support team should permanently check the spam mailbox.
732.95s - 736.87s |  And if they receive an email from one of these contacts,
736.87s - 738.59s |  respond as soon as possible
738.59s - 742.03s |  and delete both the spam email and the sent email.
742.03s - 744.03s |  So it's invisible for the user.
747.83s - 750.59s |  And another lethal weapon that we have,
753.15s - 756.47s |  it will seem maybe absurd for you,
756.47s - 760.83s |  but we register the phone number of our team
760.83s - 765.31s |  with the name of the user of the compromised email account.
765.31s - 769.75s |  So the phone call will be displayed,
769.75s - 771.35s |  the name in the screen.
773.39s - 776.39s |  I know it sounds basic, but believe me,
776.39s - 779.91s |  in a real scenario, it can save everything.
781.67s - 784.72s |  Cover.
784.72s - 786.68s |  Few days before the execution,
786.68s - 791.16s |  we sent on a script, a manual on protocols
791.16s - 793.96s |  on preventive measures for COVID-19
793.96s - 796.12s |  to our covering consultant.
797.52s - 802.52s |  As a guideline, he were to be 100% focused on coverage.
803.44s - 808.44s |  That is lead conversation, initiate presentations
808.44s - 810.84s |  and argue about our presence,
810.84s - 817.12s |  perform distraction actions to support the alpha team.
817.12s - 820.72s |  So in the preparation day, we met with the rats
820.72s - 824.24s |  to review objectives and all relevant information.
824.24s - 829.24s |  Names, position, contacts, roles, custom props,
830.40s - 834.68s |  technical language, pretext, possible situations,
834.68s - 836.48s |  issues and solutions.
836.96s - 841.96s |  And the last added value, it's a powerful weapon.
842.92s - 847.92s |  More than the phone, a nice but lethal sticker
848.72s - 853.72s |  for each collaborator who was going to interact with us
853.76s - 855.16s |  during the activity.
855.16s - 857.68s |  That is a principle of reciprocity.
857.68s - 859.00s |  It's so strong.
860.04s - 862.60s |  So let's start.
862.60s - 863.68s |  Execution day.
864.56s - 866.96s |  Support team, two consultants,
866.96s - 869.72s |  one in the field and other remotely
869.72s - 874.72s |  managing respectively the email account
874.72s - 879.72s |  and a telephone to impersonate the user profile.
880.00s - 881.20s |  Yeah.
881.20s - 884.96s |  The alpha team was composed of two consultants,
884.96s - 889.40s |  a cover consultant who will pretend to be our boss
889.40s - 891.08s |  and two other alpha.
892.04s - 895.60s |  We arrive in the first access.
895.60s - 897.84s |  The alpha team identified itself
897.84s - 900.32s |  as a corporate office staff.
900.32s - 903.16s |  With technical language, we speak with the guard
903.16s - 907.88s |  ending with, don't worry, we already know the facility.
907.88s - 912.00s |  The guard revealed allows us access
912.00s - 915.12s |  upon seeing our uniforms and credentials.
915.12s - 917.84s |  So it is important to understand
917.84s - 921.04s |  that once you are a interlocutor,
921.88s - 925.24s |  that considers you trustful person or better yet,
925.24s - 929.52s |  someone who can resolve situation.
929.52s - 931.08s |  Yeah, yeah.
931.08s - 934.72s |  Then you're standing in a privileged place.
934.72s - 938.08s |  The guard looked at us with appreciation
938.08s - 944.37s |  and announced over the radio that we were going on our own.
944.37s - 945.93s |  Okay.
945.93s - 949.13s |  Upon entering, we found ourselves in a maze.
950.21s - 953.01s |  We knew we didn't have to look like strangers
953.01s - 954.73s |  so we keep walking naturally.
955.69s - 957.97s |  We walked through several corridors
957.97s - 960.25s |  until we researched a security door
960.25s - 962.01s |  with proximity card opening
962.01s - 964.73s |  with two factors of authentication.
964.73s - 966.81s |  We stopped in front of the access,
966.81s - 971.81s |  simulating a conversation until a cat appeared.
972.37s - 977.37s |  A maintenance technician carrying a large number of boxes.
978.17s - 983.17s |  So we obviously very kindly helped him to open the door.
984.81s - 989.57s |  On the other side was an armed guard cat
989.57s - 993.01s |  who saw us in complicity with the technician
993.01s - 996.29s |  plus the uniforms and credentials.
996.29s - 1000.33s |  He went from the angry cat gesture, you know,
1000.33s - 1005.33s |  as a simple raised eyebrow of a cat who had just eaten.
1006.33s - 1007.17s |  You know, like.
1009.45s - 1011.93s |  So we advanced through the corridors,
1011.93s - 1016.93s |  very similar to those in Dead Star or Jurassic Park
1017.37s - 1022.37s |  or Resident Evil with double doors and control accesses.
1023.61s - 1028.61s |  So we knock at the crystal door and a cat on duty appeared.
1030.89s - 1034.13s |  Here, it's very important for you to understand
1034.33s - 1037.17s |  what is going on in the minds
1037.17s - 1041.69s |  and behavior of our consultants.
1041.69s - 1046.05s |  Cover must be 100% focused on establishing
1046.05s - 1051.05s |  a situation of comfort and trust with the cat.
1051.37s - 1054.73s |  So it is essential to play the pretext,
1054.73s - 1059.21s |  the game without any doubt, without any hesitation.
1059.21s - 1063.69s |  The alpha team members had to be perceived as a cat
1063.73s - 1066.77s |  as his companions, when in reality,
