**Introduction**
- This talk is about **physical security** and the **practical business aspects** of security.

**Speaker Introduction**
- Speaker's name: **The Magician**
- Magician's previous role: **Physical Security Assessor** at **Gold Sky Cybersecurity**
- Magician's hobby: **Physical Security**
- Magician's implant: **RFID and NFC-compatible** implant in their left hand

**Physical Security Controls**
- **Doors**:
  - Exposed hinges, latches, and strike plates can be exploited.
  - **Crash bars** in server rooms can be manipulated.
- **Windows**:
  - Insecure windows can be manipulated similarly to doors.
  - **Shoulder surfing** is a low-complexity risk, allowing information gathering.
- **Fencing**:
  - Establishes a clear perimeter and limits access.
  - Acts as a **passive security measure**.
- **Bollards**:
  - Reinforced obstacles preventing vehicle ramming.
  - Also a **passive security risk mitigation**.
- **Mantraps**:
  - Underutilized but effective, e.g., requiring **two separate security access controls**.
  - Require setup and adherence to procedures.

**Cameras**
- **Wi-Fi cameras** are a poor choice in many environments.
- **Active monitoring** is possible with sufficient funding.
- **Small to mid-sized businesses** often only record video for incident response.

**Electronic Access**
- **RFID and NFC** are common but can be exploited, e.g., with a **Flipper Zero**.
- **PIN codes** can be observed and compromised.
- **Implants** like the speaker's can be used for access.

**Understanding Client Priorities**
- Knowing what matters to the client is critical.
- Some clients may have misinformation about their vulnerabilities.

**Access from the Perimeter**
- Discuss access with the client and ensure you have access to all relevant doors.
- There is no shame in asking the client to show you their physical infrastructure.
- Guest badge policies can be tested firsthand.
- Social engineering is a huge topic in this context.

**Educating Employees**
- Gamify security training to encourage participation.
- Make employees feel like an integral part of security.
- Constructive criticism is key when addressing employees' security knowledge gaps.

**Communicating with Clients**
- Phrasing is important when discussing vulnerabilities and solutions.
- Avoid **fear, uncertainty, and doubt**; focus on **positive change**.
- Demonstrating vulnerabilities is more effective than just talking about them.
- Provide clear contacts and encourage clients to reach out with questions.
