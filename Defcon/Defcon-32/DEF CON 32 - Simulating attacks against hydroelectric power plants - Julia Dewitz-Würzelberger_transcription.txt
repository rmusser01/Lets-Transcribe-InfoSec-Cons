  "title": "DEF CON 32 - Simulating attacks against hydroelectric power plants - Julia Dewitz-W\u00fcrzelberger",
  "description": "In this talk we will present the ICS firing range we built and hacked to simulate an actual attack against a hydroelectric power plant and create a DFIR training from the evidence left behind. The talk aims to emphasize the importance of attack simulation in the context of critical infrastructure and the potential benefit that firing ranges can provide to such assessments.\n\nFirst we will examine the motivation behind the construction and usage of a firing range, covering various aspects including:\n\nthe threats operators of critical infrastructure face,\nhow security assessments are conducted in an OT context and\nhow an ICS firing range can be utilized to support them.\nNext we will discuss the intended use cases of the firing range and the scenario it was made to display, the flooding of a hydroelectric power plant. As a result, the relevant components and production processes of the plant will be outlined. Then we will present and go into detail about the design & architecture of the firing range:\n\nindividual physical and virtual networks and components,\nseparate Active Directory environments,\nimplemented security measures\nspecific vulnerabilities intentionally left behind.\nPicking up this last bullet-point, we continue with how we hacked the firing range and performed a Red Team assessment against it, simulating an actual attack. Starting with the C2 infrastructure we set up for the attack, we will guide the audience through the kill chain in chronological order and highlight the most important and relevant steps of the attack.\n\nOnce the offensive part of the talk concludes, a shift of perspective takes place and the attack is evaluated from the defence's point-of-view: we'll show how we identified, secured and analyzed indicators of compromise left behind by the attack. This includes the analysis of network captures, Windows event logs, memory dumps and more.\n\nThis talk will be presented by not only people from NVISO as the IT security service provider who built the firing range and performed to attack against it, but also by people from VERBUND's IT security team who actively use the firing range for training. This way we can involve both the attacker's and the defence's point-of-view.",

 Thanks for your patience, thanks for your interest in this talk today.
4.16s - 7.92s |  My colleagues and I, Sarah, Bernhard and I, my name is Julia,
7.92s - 11.68s |  we will talk about a project that we made together, a joint project,
11.68s - 15.84s |  and we actually created a run-of-river prototype together.
15.84s - 26.24s |  Since Verbund is a hydropower energy supplier in Austria,
26.24s - 29.28s |  actually, especially in the field of renewable energy,
29.28s - 32.00s |  like hydropower, solar power and wind power,
32.00s - 34.72s |  and maybe you just want to say a few words about Enviso.
36.24s - 42.48s |  Yes, hi everybody. Enviso is a security consulting company from Europe.
42.48s - 47.84s |  We are mainly focused on the financial and technology sector
47.84s - 50.80s |  and also the governmental and critical infrastructures.
51.44s - 54.80s |  So, I want to use the moment, since this was a team effort,
54.80s - 56.48s |  to give a shout-out to a few people.
56.48s - 62.64s |  So, great thanks to Alex, Moritz, Olaf, Nicolas, Vanessa and Patrick.
64.00s - 64.64s |  Thanks, Sarah.
65.20s - 68.00s |  Okay, so as I said, it's about a prototype that we built,
68.00s - 71.36s |  or specifically Enviso did a lot of the creating process.
72.00s - 75.84s |  And we chose a run-of-river power plant, hydropower plant,
75.84s - 79.60s |  to visualize the effects of a cyber attack on such a plant.
81.36s - 84.64s |  So, it's not only like a visual awareness tool,
84.64s - 87.68s |  it's also supposed to be a forensic training tool.
87.68s - 91.20s |  So, what also is included in this ICS firing range...
96.30s - 98.62s |  Okay, I hope you can still hear me.
100.46s - 105.98s |  Okay, but in fact, we really tried to also include a forensic training
105.98s - 110.06s |  in the ICS firing range that has more than, I think, 10 modules.
110.06s - 111.10s |  I think it's 15.
111.66s - 113.50s |  And Bernhard will get into that a bit later,
113.50s - 116.94s |  but you can really investigate a forensic training
116.94s - 119.82s |  in how the cyber attack on a run-of-river power plant worked.
123.44s - 125.36s |  Motivation and project idea.
127.78s - 128.28s |  Thank you.
129.22s - 133.54s |  So, what was the motivation for two companies like us to create such a prototype?
133.54s - 137.14s |  So, for Brint, it was especially that we are critical infrastructure.
138.10s - 141.06s |  We are a really large power supplier in Austria.
141.06s - 145.38s |  So, of course, IoT cybersecurity is like one of our biggest priorities.
146.10s - 148.90s |  And since all of us three are from this section,
149.54s - 152.18s |  we really wanted to do an innovative project together.
153.22s - 159.22s |  And what actually is also one of the most motivational parts for this project was
159.22s - 163.86s |  that for Brint is planning to build a really big cyber security range
163.86s - 169.14s |  focused on IoT in Austria, in Styria, at a local site of a plant.
169.14s - 172.66s |  And we really want to get all the IoT specialists there from for Brint,
172.66s - 177.30s |  but also externals to train there and to get their cybersecurity knowledge up.
177.86s - 183.54s |  So, first, we wanted to have a prototype before we really build a really big cyber range.
184.34s - 186.42s |  That was one of the great motivations.
186.42s - 187.94s |  Do you want to get into that?
188.50s - 189.22s |  Okay.
189.22s - 194.66s |  So, our main motivation is to strengthen the security resilience of our customers
195.46s - 203.54s |  by building realistic attack scenarios that represent actual IoT cyber threats.
203.54s - 206.26s |  So, we do this either in Red Team assessments or, as in this case,
206.26s - 212.18s |  we're building a realistic training scenario for Brint.
214.18s - 217.22s |  Different IoT environments has faced different challenges.
217.22s - 220.50s |  Therefore, it was very important for us to create a tailored training approach
221.14s - 224.50s |  that actually fit the requirements previously described by Julia.
225.54s - 245.10s |  So, having a visible and practical approach like in the cyber range can help to make things
245.10s - 247.42s |  more tangible and therefore to raise awareness.
257.42s - 260.46s |  And finally, if you look at the current IoT threat landscape,
260.46s - 263.42s |  you can see that the things are getting worse.
263.50s - 267.58s |  And therefore, it's even more important to have proper training capabilities at hand
267.58s - 272.38s |  to increase the detection and response readiness
272.38s - 275.42s |  of the people that actually have to deal with cyber incidents on site.
277.82s - 278.62s |  Thanks, Sarah.
278.62s - 280.78s |  So, as we said, let's summarize it.
280.78s - 284.38s |  Two things were the main objectives for this project.
284.38s - 289.18s |  It's awareness building for people who may only know a little bit about cybersecurity,
289.18s - 292.22s |  but also forensic training for specialists in the field.
292.22s - 293.02s |  Next slide, please.
297.41s - 300.53s |  So, what is really important to us, as I told you,
300.53s - 303.33s |  us three are from the field of IoT cybersecurity.
303.33s - 305.25s |  So, we're not in operational field.
305.97s - 309.49s |  We're not working directly in a power plant.
309.49s - 312.29s |  So, we need to include the knowledge from internal colleagues,
312.29s - 316.05s |  but also from manufacturers to gain really a good understanding
316.05s - 322.05s |  of how an ICS firing range could look like an abstracted model of a hydropower plant,
322.05s - 326.85s |  since it's not exactly a realistic one, but as close as possible.
327.41s - 332.53s |  And one of the really biggest inputs that we received from internal colleagues was,
332.53s - 334.37s |  of course, as we have, I think,
334.37s - 338.13s |  Verbund has already over 130 power plants in Austria.
338.93s - 343.01s |  We really need to have a control room where all the measured data comes together
343.01s - 346.45s |  and everyone can monetize the data that comes here
346.45s - 349.73s |  and see if everything's all right in the plant itself.
350.29s - 356.45s |  And we realized this kind of control room within an HMI on the ICS firing range,
356.45s - 359.73s |  where you can also control the range in itself
359.73s - 362.29s |  and you see all the measured data from the power plant.
362.29s - 366.13s |  And you can also give an input as to, say, control the wares
366.13s - 368.85s |  that is also included in this prototype.
368.85s - 371.57s |  But also, for example, you can raise the water levels.
373.17s - 378.61s |  And, yeah, so that was one of the main important inputs that our people gave us.
378.61s - 384.05s |  And we really tried to include it to make it as, you know, real as possible.
386.45s - 388.45s |  Next, I want to give you some...
389.41s - 390.21s |  Please, next slide.
394.48s - 397.84s |  I want to give you some hard facts about the ICS firing range.
397.84s - 401.12s |  As you can see, the project had a duration of around one year.
401.68s - 407.04s |  One of the challenges was that our team is in Austria, Bernhard and my team,
407.04s - 408.72s |  but Enviso is in Germany.
408.72s - 412.08s |  I think most of them were in Frankfurt and we were in Vienna.
412.08s - 414.32s |  So, of course, we had quite a big span.
415.12s - 419.28s |  And many or actually all of our meetings were remote meetings.
419.28s - 420.72s |  So, that's also a challenge.
420.72s - 424.08s |  Bernhard will get into the challenges later a bit.
424.08s - 428.40s |  But it's not so easy since we could not get together and build on it together.
428.96s - 431.28s |  But I think it still worked really well.
431.28s - 436.96s |  And what I also think is really cool is that we had a lot of people in this project.
436.96s - 438.80s |  So, now you're just seeing us three.
438.80s - 441.68s |  But as Sarah mentioned at the beginning, it was really a team effort.
441.68s - 443.76s |  We had over 30 people involved.
443.76s - 448.16s |  We had students from the university in Vienna, the technical university in Vienna,
448.16s - 450.40s |  who really programmed the cyber attack for us.
450.96s - 455.04s |  And Enviso did the part of going into the construction.
455.04s - 457.36s |  And that's why I want to give the mic to Sarah,
457.36s - 461.04s |  because she will get into the construction and logical construction part now for you.
463.36s - 464.88s |  Yeah, thank you, Julia.
464.88s - 467.12s |  So, now we're getting into the more technical part.
467.12s - 470.72s |  So, as you could see in the previous slide, the cyber range consists of two layers.
471.44s - 473.60s |  So, on top, which is the slide that you can see now,
473.60s - 476.00s |  is the scenario and visualization layer.
476.00s - 481.12s |  Below that, we have the electric cabinet with all the technical components inside.
483.12s - 491.36s |  The scenario and visualization layer has, at first, the modulated hydro power plants.
491.36s - 492.88s |  So, we have a river, of course.
492.88s - 494.56s |  We have head and tail water.
494.56s - 495.76s |  We have a turbine building.
495.76s - 496.88s |  And we have the weirs.
496.88s - 500.48s |  So, we have one twin weir for the normal operations.
500.48s - 502.64s |  And we have one emergency weir.
503.20s - 508.56s |  Since you cannot look into this little building, to make things more tangible,
508.56s - 516.08s |  we also added the HMI to the cyber range and also a model of the turbine,
516.08s - 519.92s |  including the shutters that actually control the water flow that hits the turbine.
521.60s - 523.28s |  Okay, next slide, please.
524.56s - 526.32s |  Now, you can see the electric cabinet.
527.92s - 530.64s |  Here, we have, at first, a few basic components,
530.64s - 535.36s |  as, for example, power supply and general safety and controlling equipment.
535.36s - 540.40s |  So, on the upper left, we have the contactor and electronic circuit breaker
540.40s - 541.84s |  that handle electric faults.
542.56s - 547.28s |  Additionally, we have the PSUs that provide 5, 12, or 24 volts
547.28s - 550.16s |  to the different components of the cyber range.
550.16s - 554.40s |  And below that, we have the terminal blocks that are used for the distribution of the power.
555.04s - 562.64s |  The heart for our cyber range is a network of programmable logic controllers
563.20s - 566.72s |  and Raspberry Pis that are orchestrated to emulate
567.44s - 570.32s |  electromechanical and hydraulic processes.
570.32s - 574.72s |  These PLCs are the decision-making brain of our firing range.
576.40s - 579.44s |  To make a realistic scenario, we actually implemented
579.52s - 586.56s |  a commonly used PLC, specifically the Siemens Seachem A8000.
587.76s - 591.84s |  The Raspberry Pis serve as remote IOs for these PLCs.
591.84s - 595.52s |  And in the little box on the right bottom, you can see
597.60s - 600.08s |  there are the IO drivers for the Raspberry Pi
600.08s - 602.80s |  to actually drive the stepper motors of the wheels.
602.80s - 607.36s |  Above that, in the upper right corner, you have the Siemens BoxPC.
607.36s - 610.16s |  And the Siemens BoxPC is used to drive the HMI.
611.12s - 613.04s |  So please, next slide.
613.04s - 614.96s |  So tying it all together, how does this work?
614.96s - 617.04s |  What is the logic of the cyber range?
617.04s - 621.60s |  So as I mentioned before, we have the PLCs and the Raspberry Pis
621.60s - 623.20s |  that are connected via Modbus.
624.32s - 628.40s |  We have the HMI that is connected via S7 COM with the PLCs.
629.04s - 635.12s |  And the sensors and actuators are connected via I2C and GPIOs with the Raspberry Pis.
635.12s - 640.72s |  If I talk about sensors here, then I mean the opening level sensors for the wheels
640.72s - 642.48s |  and also the shutters of the turbine.
643.60s - 645.52s |  OK, you may have recognized this.
645.52s - 648.96s |  We have a hydroelectric power plant, but we don't have water at the moment.
648.96s - 650.56s |  So that's actually bad.
650.56s - 652.00s |  So maybe there's something missing.
652.96s - 655.92s |  If you want to create a model including real water,
655.92s - 658.08s |  this is always kind of error prone.
658.08s - 661.44s |  We have a lot of electric here, so we decided to go a different approach.
662.40s - 667.44s |  And for this, we added a simulation layer to the logic of the cyber range.
668.24s - 671.36s |  In this simulation layer, we have a simulation program.
671.36s - 677.44s |  This program actually emulates the water level of the headwater of the power plant.
679.36s - 685.68s |  In combination with the actual data, so the sensor data retrieved from the Raspberry Pi,
687.12s - 689.60s |  this program calculates the new water levels
689.60s - 693.28s |  and publishes these water levels to the MQTT broker.
694.00s - 698.56s |  The Raspberry Pi's MQTT client is then subscribed to these values.
698.56s - 701.28s |  So it retrieves all the updates of the new water levels
701.28s - 703.60s |  and forwards these water levels to the PLCs.
704.24s - 704.88s |  OK, nice.
704.88s - 707.36s |  Now we have water, but still only in logic.
707.36s - 710.72s |  So you can still see no water on our model.
710.72s - 712.80s |  OK, so another step is necessary.
712.80s - 715.84s |  And therefore, we added another machine, the visualization machine.
716.64s - 723.36s |  The visualization machine is basically a projector that is tied on top of our model.
724.80s - 725.76s |  Please, next slide.
726.88s - 731.52s |  There you can see in the middle picture, you can see the projector that is on top of our model.
731.52s - 739.12s |  And in combination with our SYN client, they also consume the water levels
739.76s - 743.44s |  from the MQTT broker and project them on the model.
744.32s - 746.08s |  How did we do this?
746.08s - 750.96s |  To actually create the images for the water, there is a Unity game running
751.60s - 757.36s |  that contains that surface structure represents the surface structure of our range.
758.00s - 761.52s |  And additionally, we have a blue layer in this Unity game,
761.52s - 765.92s |  and its height is increased and decreased as needed to represent our water levels.
767.52s - 768.40s |  OK, nice.
768.40s - 770.40s |  Now we have a working power plant.
770.48s - 771.44s |  Working power plant.
772.64s - 778.24s |  But to actually create training scenarios for this cyber range,
778.24s - 779.76s |  we also need network infrastructure.
779.76s - 781.36s |  So please go to the next slide.
783.04s - 787.04s |  The network infrastructure for the firing range is also split up into two parts.
787.04s - 789.68s |  So we have the IT and the OT network.
789.68s - 796.88s |  The IT network hosts multiple virtual machines that emulate a classic office environment.
796.88s - 799.68s |  The IT network is completely virtualized.
800.56s - 804.56s |  And the OT network contains two networks.
804.56s - 806.16s |  So a virtual and a physical one.
806.16s - 809.92s |  The physical one hosts the PLCs.
810.48s - 814.96s |  And the virtual one hosts a virtualized active directory.
814.96s - 815.60s |  OK, nice.
815.60s - 819.04s |  Now we can actually start implementing attacks here in our cyber range.
820.08s - 823.44s |  And if you look at the current OT incidents,
823.44s - 827.12s |  then you can see that actually a lot of OT incidents start in IT.
827.12s - 829.44s |  So that is also the case for our attack scenario.
830.00s - 831.60s |  So a very classic one.
831.60s - 835.20s |  The attacker sends a phishing mail to the victim,
835.76s - 842.72s |  which orders the victim to download an executable from an attacker-controlled web server.
842.72s - 845.92s |  This executable, surprise, contains an SITU implant.
845.92s - 850.56s |  And after execution, the attacker has an initial foothold in the IT network.
851.20s - 854.80s |  Further, poorly configured workstation security allows the attacker to
854.96s - 862.16s |  dump credentials, escalate privileges, and finally move laterally and
862.80s - 866.00s |  compromise the jump host and the control technology DMC.
866.00s - 867.36s |  So actually very bad.
868.56s - 869.36s |  Why is this bad?
869.36s - 873.60s |  Well, the jump host and the control technology DMC is used to manage the PLCs.
873.60s - 878.40s |  So it's used to reprogram the PLCs in absolutely a place
878.40s - 880.80s |  where you do not want to have unauthorized personnel.
882.72s - 884.32s |  But it's even getting worse.
884.40s - 888.40s |  So the attacker starts enumeration of the network, dumps the active directory,
888.40s - 894.24s |  and further analyzes which servers are accessible with the currently owned privileges.
895.60s - 898.96s |  Unfortunately for the power plant, and fortunately for the attacker,
898.96s - 904.00s |  he is able to access the Nextcloud Datastore.
904.00s - 907.04s |  So what is the Nextcloud Datastore and why is this bad?
907.04s - 910.72s |  Well, the Nextcloud Datastore is used to host the project files for the PLCs.
910.72s - 914.40s |  So that's actually very valuable information for the attacker,
915.04s - 918.96s |  since the project files contain the logic of the PLCs.
918.96s - 921.92s |  And, well, the PLCs control the power plant.
921.92s - 923.12s |  So not too nice.
924.24s - 929.68s |  Attacker is happy, is exfiltrating these files via the previously established C2 channel,
931.12s - 936.48s |  analyzes it, modifies it, and re-uploads the files to the Nextcloud Datastore.
936.48s - 939.76s |  And what happens next and why this is a problem, Bernard will tell you.
942.51s - 947.39s |  At the next stage, as an OT operator, I took the project file,
947.39s - 950.11s |  deployed it on my PLCs, and the horror is starting.
950.11s - 956.51s |  So an immense flood is running over the water power plant and also the environment.
958.19s - 958.83s |  Next slide.
960.35s - 961.79s |  Training and DFIR.
963.07s - 967.87s |  We have separated into 15 labs, which are separated in three main parts.
967.87s - 970.75s |  The first main part is the analyzing part.
970.75s - 975.63s |  The second part is see how an attacker is working on the environment
975.63s - 978.35s |  and which tools they are using normally.
978.35s - 982.27s |  And also we use OS typical forensic parts.
982.27s - 986.27s |  So we will show the people who are working on a water power plant,
987.23s - 993.47s |  what can we see, what is a security engineer seeing, and what can he see in real life.
994.43s - 999.39s |  And also we get into deeper of the Siemens toolbox,
999.39s - 1002.59s |  which we use to program the logical units.
1002.59s - 1007.95s |  And we also do the analyzation of the files from the toolbox.
1008.59s - 1009.23s |  Next slide.
1013.10s - 1021.86s |  The lessons learned.
1023.14s - 1029.70s |  These are the heavy part because the ICS fire range is a bit bulky and heavy.
1030.34s - 1034.90s |  We heard before it's a lot of weight and a lot of metal in it.
1035.94s - 1040.90s |  Also, the most important part is to create an easy to use
1040.90s - 1044.66s |  and also good resilient backup and restore solution.
1044.66s - 1049.78s |  Because if we do some trainings, we should be really fast in restoring
1049.78s - 1055.38s |  and deploying and backuping the situation where we can do the live trainings on it.
1055.38s - 1061.78s |  So it took us a long time to create consistent ESXi backups
1061.78s - 1065.70s |  in combination with the graphics and also the Raspberry configuration.
1066.82s - 1067.38s |  The noise.
1068.26s - 1072.34s |  Noise is really important because it's not the best choice to
1072.34s - 1075.14s |  took the first switch which you have in your depot.
1075.14s - 1079.86s |  Normally we have a Cisco catalyst switch from an old environment.
1079.86s - 1081.70s |  So it was really noisy.
1081.70s - 1083.30s |  It was active cooled.
1083.30s - 1086.34s |  So we changed the switch to a passive cooled switch.
1086.34s - 1089.22s |  So everyone who is trying such a project,
1089.22s - 1094.26s |  use as most as you can passive components because there's some really loud.
1095.78s - 1096.66s |  Model building.
1096.66s - 1099.22s |  Yeah, model building is not a technique.
1099.22s - 1101.38s |  It's also a bit of art.
1101.38s - 1105.94s |  So you had to design the mountains and you had to design the cars and so on.
1105.94s - 1107.70s |  So a typical Austrian environment.
1108.74s - 1113.30s |  The PCAP size during the analysis and for the training is also important
1113.38s - 1119.30s |  because not everyone is happy to handle a lot of gigabytes from PCAP files.
1119.30s - 1123.14s |  And this is the next part to analyze them with Tshark.
1125.06s - 1127.86s |  Normally in the security we use Tshark.
1128.50s - 1132.58s |  But not every OT operator is familiar with Tshark.
1132.58s - 1138.02s |  So we had to switch to Wireshark which is more convenient for everybody to use.
1139.06s - 1142.10s |  And yeah, so that's all.
1145.82s - 1152.06s |  And for the toolbox, what is happening in the second part of the file?
1152.06s - 1156.06s |  Because the attacker is manipulating the toolbox file.
1157.02s - 1165.82s |  The toolbox file, the new one, is displaying the target values as the real values.
1165.82s - 1174.14s |  So the target values will show on the HMI and seems to the operator everything is fine.
1174.78s - 1179.82s |  And on the other side, the toolbox is sending zeros to the wires.
1179.82s - 1185.34s |  So the wires will not function at the moment during the attack.
1185.98s - 1188.70s |  And this is why the flood starts.
1188.70s - 1192.86s |  And the problem is normally you have the HMI,
1192.86s - 1197.34s |  the operator which is working on the HMI is not directly connected
1197.34s - 1200.70s |  or has no visual view to the water power plant.
1200.70s - 1205.10s |  And then, yeah, that's all for now.
1207.18s - 1210.30s |  Are there any questions so far?
1210.30s - 1216.14s |  Because we also have a short video where you can see what happens.
1227.44s - 1228.72s |  This is a short overview.
1229.36s - 1232.56s |  Here you see the top of the wires and the mountains.
1234.64s - 1235.92s |  I had to cheat a little bit.
1237.12s - 1239.68s |  Yeah, here are the mountains.
1239.68s - 1249.76s |  So we created a typical Austria environment to make it more home feeling for the students.
1250.32s - 1253.04s |  Here are the wires which are 3D printed.
1255.30s - 1258.90s |  This is the landscape which is getting flooded.
1261.41s - 1264.93s |  In the back, you can see the turbine which is a Kaplan turbine.
1265.73s - 1269.57s |  So it's also realistic to create.
1269.57s - 1272.85s |  It's also important to create a realistic Kaplan turbine.
1276.58s - 1278.50s |  On the left top, you see the HMI.
1281.95s - 1284.91s |  And here is the ICS component.
1284.91s - 1294.43s |  So here you can see the Siemens ICS, the A8000, and also the Siemens computer.
1298.98s - 1308.26s |  So we used everything or we tried to make the model as near as a real water power plant.
1308.26s - 1312.18s |  So normally, Siemens component will be used in this environment.
1316.96s - 1318.56s |  Yeah, it is mobile.
1318.56s - 1321.04s |  So you can bring it from point A to B.
1332.64s - 1335.52s |  Yeah, so are there any questions so far?
1339.26s - 1342.30s |  Okay, then thank you.
1347.41s - 1352.45s |  And as I see that there are some people waving, feel free to contact us and chat with us about
1352.45s - 1357.25s |  the rain and we can give you a bit more details than just the 25 minutes that we have here.
1357.89s - 1359.97s |  Thank you.
