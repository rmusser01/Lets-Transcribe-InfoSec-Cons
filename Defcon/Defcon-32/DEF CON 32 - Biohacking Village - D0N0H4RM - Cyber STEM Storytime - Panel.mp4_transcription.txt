 All right, DEF CON! How tired are you of people asking you how you're doing? Yeah? Cheer really
9.88s - 17.21s |  loudly if you're really tired of that. The other thing I'm trying to do is get people
17.21s - 24.67s |  out there to realize how good a time you guys are having in here. So, I'm going to say,
24.67s - 29.51s |  no one doesn't like cake, right? I mean, cake is universally. Can we all cheer for cake?
31.95s - 39.78s |  Everyone out there, come in here. All right, folks. Welcome to another Creator Stage Talk.
39.78s - 45.10s |  We have some killer folks here to talk to you about some very pressing issues. And I
45.10s - 48.86s |  know we started out with cake, which is going to be the high mark. We're going to be talking
48.86s - 52.46s |  about healthcare, cybersecurity, medical devices, whistleblowing, and a bunch of other really
52.46s - 56.78s |  cool stuff. In some sense, it can be a little bit of a downer. So, I don't have any trigger
56.78s - 60.50s |  warnings or anything for our panel, but the only thing I'll ask is for the audience, we'll
60.50s - 65.14s |  have an opportunity for a little Q&A at the end, unless we go really over. But just be
65.14s - 69.50s |  respectful of the community and other folks, because sometimes this can be a really personal
69.50s - 73.62s |  thing as we're going to talk about. I think the first thing we're going to do is actually
73.62s - 78.54s |  go down the line and do introductions. And before I do that, can you guys hear us okay?
78.54s - 83.18s |  I know we're competing over here. You guys are good? All right. So, let's go right down
83.18s - 88.70s |  the line, Matt on, and go to introduce yourself, tell the crowd what you do, and we'll get
88.70s - 92.18s |  going on to the real good questions, all right? After you.
92.18s - 99.14s |  Sounds good. I'm Matt Hazlett. I'm the Chief Regulatory Officer at MedTech currently. I
99.14s - 105.38s |  most recently left the FDA a couple weeks ago. I was at the FDA for eight and a half
105.38s - 112.90s |  years, started getting very involved in the cybersecurity policy and implementation efforts.
113.18s - 120.18s |  So, I was very involved in the premarket cybersecurity guidance, writing a significant portion of
120.18s - 127.54s |  that, and oversaw our implementation efforts. So, the reviewer resources training of how
127.54s - 132.02s |  we were going to review cybersecurity given our new statutory authorities.
132.02s - 141.78s |  Give it up for Matt. All right. Hi, everyone. I am Erica Chung. I'm currently
141.78s - 146.94s |  the Executive Director of a nonprofit called Ethics in Entrepreneurship. My interest in
146.94s - 152.86s |  the safety of medical devices started off at my very first job when I was 22 years old.
152.86s - 159.54s |  I was a lab associate working for a biomedical company called Theranos, which ended up being
159.54s - 163.98s |  a $9 billion fraud scandal, which I was one of the key whistleblowers who reported the
163.98s - 171.42s |  company to regulators that stopped them from utilizing a faulty device on patients.
171.42s - 178.90s |  And I am also involved as a board member of Whistleblowers of America, which we provide
178.90s - 183.66s |  mental health services and peer support for whistleblowers across the United States, and
183.66s - 189.90s |  also an advisor to the Signals Network, which is an agency that helps whistleblowers with
189.90s - 198.86s |  legal advice, safe housing, funding, job placement, in the event that they are in
198.86s - 202.30s |  need of those services. Give it up for Erica.
205.42s - 211.10s |  Hey, everybody. I'm Andrew Carney. I'm a program manager at a relatively new federal agency,
211.10s - 217.50s |  ARPA-H, where I work on healthcare cybersecurity, patient data privacy. I'm also the program
217.50s - 222.06s |  manager for the AI Cyber Challenge at DARPA. So if you haven't already, please come visit
222.06s - 228.06s |  us next door and spend some time there, have some fun. And before all of that, I spent
228.06s - 235.90s |  most of the last 15 years as a vulnerability researcher and a painful CTF player. And I
235.90s - 241.02s |  am now semi-retired from that fabulous pastime. Please go check out DEF CON CTF as well if
241.02s - 247.34s |  you haven't. The folks put on an amazing game. And I'm super excited to be, so the last year
247.66s - 253.66s |  plus in healthcare, looking at the cybersecurity of healthcare and coming from a very offensive
253.66s - 260.62s |  kind of mindset, just seeing what we can do from a defensive position and really hoping
260.62s - 267.74s |  to supercharge our efforts to safeguard this sector. Give it up, Andrew.
267.74s - 274.46s |  Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Nick Notaroj. I'm the deputy director of CISA.
274.46s - 280.46s |  Hopefully you've heard of us, some ways you've performed. And earlier in my career, I was
280.46s - 284.06s |  actually a hospital administrator and a flight medic. So I started my career in healthcare.
284.06s - 287.74s |  So it's great to be here today to merge cybersecurity and healthcare together and
287.74s - 292.14s |  talk about what we can all do to continue to make the sector more safe. Thanks.
292.14s - 300.54s |  All right. So we're going to, yeah, this is, give it up for the whole panel. Try to
300.54s - 307.50s |  beat them out next door. Give them a clap. All right. I think it's important to level
307.50s - 311.58s |  set a little bit, but I want to take a poll the audience real quick. Raise your hand if
311.58s - 316.78s |  you work in healthcare, some adjacent field, raise your hand. There's no one in this audience.
316.78s - 321.10s |  This is all brand new for you. I take it. Just kidding. It's like everyone, it's like
321.10s - 326.38s |  my high school reunion out there. All right. I do think it's important for us to level set
326.38s - 330.06s |  a little bit. And we're going to talk about threat land, landscape a bit. I have some,
330.06s - 335.18s |  a little bit of a couple of slides at the end, but a deputy director, if you could tell us a
335.18s - 341.10s |  little bit more than about the threat landscape and what you're seeing kind of nationally about
341.10s - 346.14s |  healthcare ransomware because, and just healthcare threats, generally speaking, just give us a little
346.14s - 350.46s |  bit of a one-on-one and what are you seeing? Yeah. Thanks, Christian. I think the big thing
350.46s - 354.54s |  we're trying to message out to folks as we look at the healthcare sector, we're seeing an increase
354.54s - 359.82s |  in the volume frequency and complexity of attacks against the healthcare sector, not just in the
359.82s - 364.86s |  United States, but globally. I think when we think about healthcare, if we go back to kinetic
364.86s - 370.86s |  warfare, going back centuries, we never attacked hospitals, right? We always protected healthcare
370.86s - 375.10s |  providers. We always protected the tents with the red cross on it. We never attacked those
375.10s - 379.82s |  institutions. But today we're seeing attacks against healthcare organizations throughout the
379.82s - 384.14s |  country. This is not just about urban America. We're seeing attacks against rural America as
384.14s - 388.86s |  well, where arguably healthcare systems are more critical in those communities, given the access
388.86s - 393.26s |  to care and the access to backup care is much further away. And the consequence of patient
393.26s - 398.46s |  safety is even greater. You know, as we look at a lot of, everyone has published a top three or
398.46s - 405.18s |  top five list of ransomware attacks or sector impacts. Healthcare continues to be in that top
405.18s - 410.86s |  three and top five list of every list that I see as sectors are being attacked by our adversaries.
410.86s - 413.98s |  And we're not just talking about nation states. We're not just talking about China, Russia,
413.98s - 418.78s |  Iran, North Korea. We're seeing cyber terrorists and cyber criminal organizations also attacking
418.78s - 424.06s |  healthcare. Why they foresee money there. They know that I think healthcare facilities are kind
424.06s - 429.10s |  of one-stop shops. You have access to PII. You have access to billing information. You have
429.10s - 432.94s |  patient information. You have information that essentially people don't want out in the public
432.94s - 437.82s |  space that you can get a hold of. It really is that one-stop shop and our adversaries know this.
437.82s - 441.34s |  So we're continuing to see this increase in attacks against healthcare, which is why it's
441.34s - 445.74s |  even more critical today to make sure that we're building resilience across the healthcare space.
445.74s - 451.74s |  And when we talk about healthcare, it's not just hospitals. It's that entire spectrum that's needed
451.74s - 456.54s |  for healthcare to be delivered. So it includes medical manufacturing, distribution of pharma,
456.54s - 462.22s |  labs, blood, biotech, health IT, insurers, payers, HMOs, that entire spectrum that's
462.22s - 466.38s |  needed for that clinical care to be delivered. And we want to make sure that we're continuing
466.38s - 471.26s |  to build resilience across the board. That is awesome. And I have a couple
471.26s - 476.54s |  of slides to now take a little bit of another audience poll here. Raise your hand if you've
476.62s - 484.30s |  ever had your medical records leak or be breached. Raise your hand. All right. That number is growing
484.30s - 489.58s |  every time. I'm going to just take a gut pull here for anyone brave enough to raise their hand.
489.58s - 495.74s |  Has anyone had their clinical care impacted by some type of cyber attack? Maybe your appointment
495.74s - 501.26s |  was canceled. I'm seeing a couple of hands. Maybe you couldn't go to the hospital that was nearby.
501.26s - 505.50s |  You heard about that. Now there's a couple of hands. That's going to increase because
505.50s - 513.74s |  what are we seeing now? You know, 2024 has been a banner year for healthcare ransomware.
513.74s - 517.58s |  And we're seeing big attacks and some not ransomware things like CrowdStrike.
518.14s - 523.18s |  But what I wanted to show you guys is for those of you who don't really work in this very often,
523.18s - 529.34s |  now it's not just about privacy of data. It's not just about the financial threat.
530.22s - 539.18s |  It's also about threats to clinical care and human life. And so here's some social media I grabbed
539.90s - 544.06s |  based on one of these attacks this year about people that were working. These are doctor and
544.70s - 550.06s |  nursing forums on Reddit and other places where they basically talk about their experience
550.62s - 555.74s |  working at some of these hospitals during a ransomware attack. And so in true DEF CON
555.74s - 561.10s |  fashion, it's stuff like largest attack, largest hospital system in the country is under attack.
561.10s - 567.66s |  No one knows where the forms are. We got a separate sign out. Nursing staff was trying
567.66s - 573.34s |  to communicate what medications patients are on. Had to do stuff from memory. We were just told the
573.34s - 576.94s |  internet may be out for days. We're still on a previous owner's network and they're down in
576.94s - 581.58s |  multiple states. And then there's a nursing comment here. Vermont here, they never taught me how to
581.58s - 589.02s |  use paper chart in nursing school. What about this one? We brought a trauma patient to an
589.02s - 593.50s |  Ascension hospital and the trauma team was freaking out because half the team didn't get
593.50s - 598.70s |  the page or notification. They're down doing paper charts, handwriting orders and doing
598.70s - 607.42s |  consults over their personal phones. The top comment says they couldn't get Tylenol for a
607.42s - 619.25s |  patient that needed it for two hours. We also learned a lot about critical connected infrastructure
619.25s - 623.97s |  this last year with things like CrowdStrike, where it wasn't even an attack, but we saw huge
623.97s - 629.25s |  amounts of hospitals go down as a consequence. And this is a couple social media grabs I pulled
630.29s - 635.17s |  for the CrowdStrike issue. I swear to you, I pulled this image on the left here right off of Reddit.
636.13s - 640.29s |  So when the hospital went down, they took all their patients and they had to write them on a
640.29s - 645.01s |  whiteboard, where they were, what their name was and what the current issue was. On the same
645.01s - 653.09s |  whiteboard below, they drew this picture. The ICU telemetry monitors are down. They said that the
653.09s - 658.85s |  ones in the NICU weren't operational. They're unable to upload labs. How many of you folks
658.85s - 663.33s |  think this type of stuff is really important? The ability to do laboratory tests and imaging and
663.33s - 667.81s |  do things in electronic health record. Raise your hand. How many of you feel like doctors and
667.81s - 672.77s |  nurses can't be good at the jobs of taking care of their sick patients without these things? Raise
672.77s - 679.01s |  your hand. You are correct. And so we're going to go into kind of the first question at the
679.01s - 685.01s |  tip of this little period here. Cyber attacks degrade, delay, disrupt and decay the digital
685.01s - 689.97s |  systems that power timely, life-saving medical care. And for this, we're going to go into this
689.97s - 693.73s |  Q&A and try to get some amazing insights from the folks here. But I also remind you, there's an
693.73s - 699.57s |  opportunity at the end to ask some questions yourself. So first question has to do with a lot
699.57s - 705.41s |  of what we continue to learn more about every year is this interdependency. So after 2008,
705.41s - 711.25s |  the financial crisis, the nation went under a painstaking process to try to better understand
711.25s - 716.13s |  and map the dependencies of the financial sector, to understand if this bank fails, what will happen
716.13s - 722.37s |  to the rest of it. In 2024, we've seen a bunch of attacks, change, ascension, and then not
722.37s - 727.01s |  Krausweig was an attack. But the question I have for the first part of this panel is, should the
727.01s - 733.25s |  U.S. undergo a similar mapping exercise, right, where we understand where the critical interdependencies,
733.25s - 738.05s |  third-party risk, are of healthcare delivery organizations in this country? Because to my
738.05s - 743.65s |  knowledge, no one knows what's going to happen. No one knows where the linchpins of linchpins are.
743.65s - 749.09s |  We have a pile of them. So the first question is, what do you all think about mapping the sector
749.09s - 752.61s |  dependencies and what we should do about that? And this is not a new thing and we've been doing
752.61s - 758.77s |  it for a little bit, but let's learn about it now. What's going on? So I'm happy to go first.
758.77s - 762.69s |  I'm a huge fan of mapping out the sector, something I tried to do actually when I was at
762.69s - 768.13s |  HHS back in 2009. I think the challenge is it's getting that visibility. And I think we've made
768.13s - 773.01s |  some progress. CISA right now is trying to look at cascading consequence analysis. And part of
773.01s - 777.01s |  that is really understanding, mapping out the sectors, understanding where those critical nodes
777.01s - 782.93s |  are. So we are much further ahead than where we were 20 years ago, but I still offer we're still
782.93s - 789.41s |  nowhere near where we need to be to truly understand those interdependencies within a
789.41s - 794.29s |  sector, much less between sectors. I think the other part of it is getting the visibility to
794.29s - 800.05s |  understanding the actual software platforms and the other challenges. So it's one thing to say
800.05s - 806.13s |  that the connections exist between this type of financial system and healthcare and agriculture
806.13s - 810.69s |  and those types of entities, but to get to that next level to understand the market space to
810.69s - 814.93s |  understand that is just a massive undertaking. We've done, there's pockets of it. There's a
814.93s - 820.29s |  great report from 2013 that looked at working through the Department of Commerce that looked
820.29s - 825.01s |  at understanding global supply chain issues for pharmaceuticals and some medical devices.
825.01s - 829.25s |  So there's pockets of this type of information out there, but we don't have the ability yet
829.25s - 834.37s |  to kind of coalesce it. We've launched a recent IT tool called STAR that we're trying to use to
834.37s - 838.45s |  really understand some of that, but it's still at a very macro level. There's a lot more that
838.45s - 842.53s |  needs to get done. A lot of that information is proprietary, so getting access to it is somewhat
842.53s - 847.17s |  of a challenge. And then frankly, the question I always ask when we think about how the
847.17s - 851.49s |  government should be asking questions and getting information, the next question I always ask is,
851.49s - 855.01s |  what are we going to do with it? I never want to be in a government agency where we're asking for
855.01s - 860.29s |  information that we can't actually use to have some return on investment and value back to the
860.29s - 864.21s |  people providing information. And understanding what that looks like is another piece that we're
864.21s - 869.41s |  trying to figure out. How do we get information and how do we ensure there's an adequate ROI back
869.41s - 873.81s |  to those information sharers that can help them increase their cyber defense posture?
876.61s - 882.69s |  Just kind of building on that, I mean, it's really interesting talking to different stakeholders,
883.65s - 889.81s |  in both industry and government, about their introspection into the interdependencies and then
890.61s - 896.37s |  the acknowledgement that there may be common good upstream, but perhaps a reticence to actually
896.37s - 902.05s |  provide the information that would enable that common good to manifest. And so we've
904.29s - 909.17s |  talking to folks over the last year and trying to identify how do we get a lot of value
909.17s - 914.61s |  from investment of public interest of taxpayer dollars from a research perspective, from a
914.61s - 920.05s |  kind of transition or ops perspective. How do we find those really high value points to insert,
920.05s - 926.45s |  inject kind of like support? And it requires collaboration at a pretty large scale, but it
926.45s - 931.73s |  doesn't necessarily require an exposure, like for the folks that we would need to kind of talk to
931.73s - 937.57s |  that we are talking to. Folks are getting braver and that's a very good sign. And sort of recognizing
937.57s - 943.57s |  that we all win together or we all lose. So I think we're making progress, but we could definitely
943.57s - 953.49s |  make progress faster. I'd say on the medical device side, it's incredibly interesting to
953.49s - 958.93s |  think about how to scope such an exercise because you're going to have differences.
958.93s - 965.09s |  The medical device landscape is incredibly complex when you're ranging from implants to
966.05s - 972.61s |  bedside equipment, capital equipment, software functions that only operate on a mobile device or
972.61s - 978.85s |  in the cloud. Then looking at what's actually used in different facilities and whether there's
978.85s - 987.17s |  a differentiation between similar devices from other manufacturers. So if you have one issue from
987.97s - 993.65s |  one device type, do they have a backup that can still have some continuity of care?
994.29s - 1001.89s |  We've also seen a lot of discussions around hospital systems trying to figure out
1001.89s - 1008.21s |  how to respond to ransomware and what devices are relying on network or external connections
1008.21s - 1016.13s |  because the initial response is to pull that network down and retract in order to better
1016.13s - 1022.05s |  defend the larger ecosystem. But we've seen instances where all of a sudden the product
1022.05s - 1029.41s |  security people are running to those systems before they flip the switch to tell them that
1029.41s - 1035.01s |  if they do that, they have surgeries in progress that would be interrupted because they're losing
1035.01s - 1042.69s |  that live access. So how do we maintain that continuity of care in response and how do we
1042.69s - 1048.93s |  know what would be impacted based off of different actions that could be taken to resolve some of
1048.93s - 1055.97s |  these issues? So the mapping can get incredibly complex. So then it's the how do you approach it
1055.97s - 1062.45s |  and how do you make it useful for the facilities that are using it as well as useful for
1063.41s - 1066.77s |  government regulators to help in response activities as well.
1072.34s - 1078.10s |  Kind of a terrifying thought. So many times when I think about these types of problems, I'm always
1078.10s - 1084.66s |  like surely someone has done this and surely we have really great data on this and so the
1084.66s - 1090.18s |  thought of that we don't really even understand these interdependencies at any deep level and
1090.18s - 1096.26s |  certainly don't have visibility over the entirety of the problem makes me think about how many other
1096.26s - 1101.06s |  CrowdStrike-like issues we're going to have or like what's going to happen when, we'll talk
1101.06s - 1104.82s |  about this in a little bit, when there's only really three or four electronic health record
1104.82s - 1109.78s |  vendors in the whole country and we don't understand the technical plumbing behind it
1109.78s - 1113.86s |  and understand what's really going to happen when something goes down. All right, we're going to go
1113.86s - 1119.86s |  to question two here. All right, this question does not apply to anyone in this room, I guarantee it.
1120.58s - 1125.30s |  Just kidding, it's everyone. Health hackers, cybersecurity professionals employed at health
1125.30s - 1130.34s |  systems, medical device manufacturers are often not considered whistleblower protections unless
1130.34s - 1138.10s |  they see criminal activity but we hear time and time again from folks in these spaces that they
1138.10s - 1143.62s |  see problems and they can't fix them and they're increasingly worried about what would happen
1144.18s - 1149.78s |  when these issues are not fixed. So my question to the panel is really just talking about
1150.50s - 1156.98s |  should we expand protections to folks in technical health care roles or you could
1156.98s - 1162.18s |  say technical roles more broadly that offer some protections when they don't necessarily
1162.18s - 1168.66s |  cross the line of criminality but they believe in good faith that there is going to be some issue
1168.66s - 1176.58s |  before the ransomware hits. So maybe also, take it away. So I think when these whistleblower
1177.38s - 1182.26s |  complaints sort of come about, you have to understand where they exist. Is it happening
1182.26s - 1187.62s |  internally in the company and is there a concern that you can address with the internal controls
1187.62s - 1194.18s |  that exist within a company and a lot of that is do you have the leadership buy-in, do you have the
1194.18s - 1199.54s |  board buy-in to take cybersecurity concerns seriously and how do you sort of implement
1199.54s - 1206.74s |  that culture within that organization to have them say this is a top critical issue in order
1206.74s - 1213.38s |  to maintain good business practices, in order to maintain patient safety by the examples that you
1213.38s - 1220.02s |  have seen and so there's a lot of work to be done in terms of what can the infrastructure within an
1220.02s - 1225.06s |  organization look like so the people that are working with these technologies can action on
1225.06s - 1231.14s |  them appropriately and then there's the sort of external whistleblowing. I've tried to basically
1231.14s - 1235.86s |  work within my organization. It doesn't seem like these issues are going to be addressed
1235.86s - 1242.34s |  so what do I do now, who do I turn to in order to prevent some major crisis from happening
1242.34s - 1249.14s |  and I will say if there are lines that are crossed, if say a company does not make a disclosure
1249.14s - 1255.46s |  about a hack that has happened, then there are ways in which you can report to the SEC that they
1255.46s - 1261.06s |  didn't make the appropriate disclosures for the information that was granted and you are covered
1261.06s - 1268.26s |  under federal whistleblower protections in those cases and then there are also several different
1268.26s - 1274.02s |  whistleblower protections that exist at a state level but it has to sort of pay attention to what
1274.02s - 1278.90s |  those agencies are and then it also depends what type of regulatory agency. Are you talking to the
1278.90s - 1287.30s |  HHS? Are you talking to the SEC? Who are the appropriate parties involved that can help guide
1287.30s - 1294.26s |  you through the process of getting the concern addressed? Whether it's patient information that
1294.26s - 1298.90s |  shouldn't have been disclosed that is disclosed, whether it's a ransomware attack that instead of
1298.90s - 1304.42s |  sort of addressing that and submitting that to the FBI or someone else that that happened
1306.18s - 1311.46s |  and with those there should be expansion of those protections for some of these people but
1311.46s - 1317.30s |  it's also about kind of turning back to the internal controls. What most of these people
1317.30s - 1323.14s |  who are reporting these concerns are concerned about are can I maintain my anonymity? If I can't
1323.14s - 1328.74s |  maintain my anonymity, will I be able to keep my job? Am I going to face any type of retaliation?
1329.70s - 1335.22s |  Is there going to be litigation involved? Is there going to be public backlash? Am I going
1335.22s - 1341.14s |  to get blacklisted from my career? And so I think that's some of the things fundamentally
1341.14s - 1346.66s |  and structurally both in terms of like how we treat people who report concerns in addition to
1346.66s - 1353.46s |  the sort of external infrastructure that we need to take into consideration considering we're seeing
1353.46s - 1357.78s |  so many people speak up about the fact that they're seeing these attacks but they don't
1357.78s - 1362.66s |  really know what to do because there's not necessarily enough external pressure to address
1362.66s - 1366.50s |  them just yet. So I think those are some of the fundamentals to pay attention to
1367.30s - 1371.70s |  when it comes to working with people who are concerned about these issues but
1371.70s - 1378.66s |  the regulatory landscape isn't as clear cut yet. Raise your hand if you've ever worked for a
1378.66s - 1382.66s |  health care organization, you had some real concerns about the security, you raised them
1382.66s - 1386.26s |  a bunch of times and then nothing happened and you found a new job. Raise your hand.
1386.82s - 1389.46s |  No. Yep, that's a common story.
1392.34s - 1395.06s |  There should be more hands up. I've talked to you guys at bars.
1397.54s - 1403.70s |  Anything else? Any comments? I'm going to pull a little bit of a thread out of that if that's
1403.70s - 1407.94s |  all right. I was just amazed at the work that you do to support whistleblowers and one of the things
1407.94s - 1412.98s |  I learned is how much you do to support the mental health and well-being of these whistleblowers as
1412.98s - 1417.78s |  they go through incredibly stressful situations. I imagine there are folks in this audience that
1417.78s - 1423.22s |  feel similarly those stress and pressure and if we could just take a moment if you have any advice,
1423.22s - 1426.90s |  suggestions, anything that folks out there that might feel some of those constraints
1427.54s - 1434.66s |  that they could access. Yeah, I always tell people whistleblowing is a last resort. You
1434.66s - 1439.94s |  shouldn't really rely on like one David against the Goliath for some of these issues. So the best
1439.94s - 1446.26s |  way to help whistleblowers is usually to figure out how to build the infrastructure to address
1446.26s - 1451.70s |  concerns early because it's an incredibly stressful process. I haven't met a single
1451.70s - 1457.22s |  person that this hasn't deeply affected their families, their mental health, their careers,
1457.22s - 1463.22s |  their professions. It's an incredibly stressful process that is very difficult to negotiate and
1463.22s - 1471.14s |  navigate. So people who ever witness someone in that position, the more support infrastructure you
1471.14s - 1476.66s |  can build around those people, the better they're going to fare and then if you are in a
1476.66s - 1481.78s |  position that you're reporting a concern, the biggest piece of advice is try to find a lawyer.
1481.78s - 1487.78s |  A lawyer you can work on contingency and not just the lawyer that your company provides because you
1487.78s - 1492.42s |  need someone who's going to protect your own interest and really show you the landscape of how
1492.42s - 1498.90s |  you can appropriately protect yourself. And then additionally to that, you know, there are lots of
1498.90s - 1504.10s |  advocacy agencies, non-profits that are here to help and to support people who are going through
1504.98s - 1510.90s |  that tough process. Whether it's Whistleblowers of America, whether it's different regulatory
1510.90s - 1515.22s |  agencies that have a Budsman's programs that are meant to really support the people who are
1515.22s - 1520.74s |  coming forward. But make sure you have a good support network of the right people through it
1520.74s - 1526.98s |  because it's really critical for people in that position. Give it up. That's really great stuff.
1529.06s - 1535.78s |  All right, we're going to shift back gears to some medical devices. All right, there are no legacy
1535.78s - 1542.34s |  medical devices in hospitals anymore. We fixed the problem, right Matt? You fix it? No. Oh wow.
1543.38s - 1550.10s |  I don't have trillions of dollars. They're often cited as a major source of risk for hospitals.
1550.50s - 1556.34s |  They have antiquated operating systems, unpatched remote vulnerabilities. They're often deployed on
1556.34s - 1562.82s |  super flat networks. And this is not just a problem in rural America or poorly resourced hospitals.
1562.82s - 1570.10s |  I mean we see similar types of really concerning implementations deployments in larger hospitals
1570.10s - 1574.98s |  as well. Some of which you might actually get care at. The question I have for here is talking
1574.98s - 1579.38s |  about upgrade. And I think it's going to be a really important thing to talk about. How can we
1580.10s - 1588.74s |  take this problem of patching legacy medical devices that many people thought would have been
1588.74s - 1592.74s |  solved by now, like 20 years ago. You think people would have been like, oh, we're not going to be
1592.74s - 1597.70s |  talking about this at DEF CON 32 anymore. So clearly what we're doing isn't working. What's
1597.70s - 1601.70s |  some new approaches we can get at, Andrew, that I think would be a good opportunity for us to
1602.42s - 1609.38s |  get into? You are very kind, Christian. You're very kind. So yeah, the legacy medical device
1609.38s - 1614.82s |  problem or legacy device problem generally is especially problematic in healthcare because of
1614.82s - 1621.94s |  how many devices we use to provide care, to provide high quality care. And so getting the most life
1621.94s - 1626.98s |  out of a system that's still performant, right, there's a lot of value in that. But if the
1626.98s - 1631.06s |  security pieces of that, if the security or connectivity or interoperability elements of that
1631.62s - 1635.22s |  device, despite its ability to provide care, maintaining, you know, being sufficiently
1635.22s - 1640.66s |  performant, if it can't, maybe not, I would have, if you would ask me 15 years ago to
1641.70s - 1645.78s |  develop a device that would be safe from today's threats, I'd be like, nope, can't do that.
1647.62s - 1649.38s |  So, you know, how we think about this space.
1652.90s - 1659.30s |  Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Very nice. DEF CON next, everybody.
1659.46s - 1666.98s |  Amazing. So I think, so you have this large, complex ecosystem with lots of different vendors,
1666.98s - 1671.06s |  lots of different stakeholders, you have providers that are doing everything, their
1671.06s - 1678.26s |  focus should remain on care. I have a small aneurysm, every time someone tells me that
1678.26s - 1684.26s |  better training for clinicians will solve hospital cybersecurity, I flip the table,
1684.26s - 1688.90s |  rage quit and leave immediately. Ideally, we want to get to a place where clinical staff
1688.90s - 1693.38s |  don't think about the cybersecurity of the systems they're dealing with. That's the dream.
1694.34s - 1699.70s |  But we still have this very complex, diverse tech ecosystem to deal with. And so how we do that,
1699.70s - 1703.70s |  and how we do that in a way that is context sensitive to each different clinical environment,
1703.70s - 1708.50s |  to each different department, that's not something that I've seen addressed in industry,
1708.50s - 1713.14s |  kind of like enterprise tooling, like does not hit the, it's not looking at that problem space,
1713.14s - 1717.14s |  because it's really hard. And there's not necessarily like the upside, I think, to them
1717.38s - 1723.14s |  from an investment standpoint. So at ARPA-H, we are looking at how we can invest and create the
1723.14s - 1728.98s |  next generation of tools to address that space, so that all of the hospitals, all the clinical
1728.98s - 1735.54s |  environments in the US can have like more performant care of their own kind of healthcare
1735.54s - 1739.86s |  technology ecosystems. So we can understand what's there, kind of going back to this mapping
1739.86s - 1745.14s |  question from earlier, you can't defend what you can't find, what you can't see. So how do we
1745.14s - 1749.46s |  understand the environment? And then how do we empower the IT staff, even if they're only one or
1749.46s - 1756.98s |  two folks, to engage with and manage that environment in a super effective way, when
1756.98s - 1760.74s |  they're dealing with, you know, hundreds of thousands of devices across hundreds, potentially
1760.74s - 1765.38s |  tens to hundreds of vendors, like the configuration management alone is a nightmare. So it's just
1765.38s - 1773.38s |  incredibly kind of challenging stack of problems, on top of the fact that if you make a mistake,
1773.38s - 1778.10s |  or if your devices are out of commission, like you increase the mortality of your patients every
1778.10s - 1783.54s |  time you increase the delay to care. And so, you know, we don't really have a choice but to do
1783.54s - 1787.86s |  better in that space. And so I'm really excited to see, we've had a lot of engagement across
1787.86s - 1792.90s |  healthcare providers, across industry, you know, folks coming to the table with, you know, hey, we
1792.90s - 1797.06s |  kind of had this idea for this space, let's see if we can make it work, let's see if we can,
1797.06s - 1802.50s |  you know, make a huge dent in this challenge. So yeah, I'm very excited to kind of see what
1802.50s - 1808.58s |  we can do, because it really is a tremendous, like, just technical challenge. But I think
1808.58s - 1811.54s |  I think it's obviously it's worth solving. Hell, yeah.
1812.90s - 1815.62s |  Whoo. Defcon next, everybody. Defcon next.
1816.82s - 1820.58s |  All right, Matt, do you want to pick up a little bit where that left off from the legacy perspective
1820.58s - 1825.94s |  from, you know, not now's current FDA, but maybe in the past, right? Tell us a little bit about
1825.94s - 1829.14s |  what your guys's evolution of thinking has been around it around this.
1830.02s - 1838.02s |  Yeah, a lot of our effort has started in the healthcare sector Coordinating Council and in
1838.02s - 1844.74s |  the International Medical Device Regulators Forum, or FDA involvement, not our anymore.
1845.94s - 1853.30s |  That it's vocal memory from eight and a half years there, it's hard to fight. But a lot of
1853.30s - 1858.58s |  the effort has been very collaborative, trying to get the healthcare perspective, the medical
1858.58s - 1865.62s |  device manufacturer perspective, as well as the regulator involvement, the legacy device problem
1865.62s - 1873.94s |  is not going away anytime soon. Especially since FDA's statutory authority for cybersecurity just
1873.94s - 1882.34s |  took effect last year. It's going to take some time for those better devices to fully help
1882.98s - 1891.94s |  prevent some of the onset of the legacy device problem. A lot of what we see in response to
1891.94s - 1898.10s |  some of the issues to maintain continuity of care is, okay, well, we'll just make it
1898.10s - 1905.38s |  not connected to the Ethernet, and that removes a lot of our risk. But as we start to see devices
1905.38s - 1911.86s |  evolve and additional functionality being added, once you start doing that, you can start impacting
1911.86s - 1916.66s |  some of the intended use of that medical device and some of the core functionality that that
1916.66s - 1922.98s |  device is providing. So there's a greater cost to some of those mitigations that were available on
1922.98s - 1928.98s |  older products may no longer be available on some of the more recent products that are going out.
1928.98s - 1938.26s |  So it's a complex issue. It's also a regulated environment for updating and patching devices. So
1938.26s - 1946.42s |  making sure that addressing some of those challenges to make sure that the device is not
1946.42s - 1954.58s |  impacted by some of these updates to address some of the vulnerabilities, it's going to take
1954.58s - 1961.70s |  a kind of large collaborative effort to make sure that all of the nuances, the challenges,
1961.70s - 1968.18s |  and the best product for patients is what's ultimately achieved. Because at the end of the
1968.18s - 1973.38s |  day, that's always been FDA's mission while I worked there. It's always putting the patient
1973.38s - 1981.06s |  first and putting the patient's top of mind in all of our approaches. But the legacy device
1981.06s - 1987.78s |  challenge is just one that's going to take a lot of government coordination, as well as a lot of
1987.78s - 1994.50s |  coordination across healthcare facilities and the medical device manufacturer community in order
1994.50s - 2001.94s |  to get to workable solutions, not just for what's out there today, but also to maintain the devices
2001.94s - 2008.74s |  that are currently out there and going to be going out there because the medical device lifecycle is
2008.74s - 2016.10s |  so different than traditional tech. Clinicians will use a device until it no longer physically
2016.10s - 2023.30s |  functions, and that's a hard place to secure. So it's just addressing all of those challenges
2024.26s - 2030.90s |  and finding the right solutions and fixes. Fantastic. And I'm going to put you on the spot.
2030.90s - 2036.18s |  I didn't tell you about this question. But I'm sure that healthcare is the only sector that
2036.18s - 2041.30s |  you have to deal with that has this legacy problem, right? It's only healthcare. There are no lessons
2041.30s - 2045.54s |  learned or stuff you figured out from other sectors that we could apply here.
2045.54s - 2050.90s |  Sarcasm. I mean, I'm assuming this is not a unique problem to healthcare. We talk about it a lot. But
2050.90s - 2055.78s |  what are you seeing across other sectors that maybe we can learn a little bit from the healthcare side?
2055.78s - 2060.18s |  I mean, I think it's not unique to the sector, which is probably a good thing and also a scary
2060.18s - 2066.50s |  thing to some extent. What do we see across the board? I see a lot of Windows 95. I see a lot of
2066.50s - 2071.62s |  Clippy from Office, who I'm a fan of Clippy. I want to bring Clippy back. But we really need to
2072.26s - 2076.02s |  look at what the next generation looks like. We've seen this in food and agriculture. We've
2076.02s - 2079.30s |  seen this in the water sector. We've seen this in every sector as we go across the board.
2079.30s - 2084.18s |  Because I think there's still a perception in most organizations that cybersecurity is a nuisance
2084.18s - 2088.90s |  versus a necessity. And we need to make that pivot and get people to realize that this isn't
2088.90s - 2094.42s |  just about being an inconvenience or taking down a unit or part of your organization for a period of
2094.42s - 2100.18s |  time so we can upgrade or patch, but it's a necessity to ensure the prompt and accurate and
2100.18s - 2104.82s |  strong delivery of care and safe delivery of care. While frankly, also, if people are looking at this
2104.82s - 2109.54s |  really from a numbers perspective, it is in the best interest of an organization in the long run
2109.54s - 2114.74s |  to take these steps early on. So this is something we're seeing across the board,
2114.74s - 2118.98s |  but it's frankly something that we need to change the entire landscape of how we're talking
2118.98s - 2123.94s |  with everybody from CISOs to clinical personnel in the healthcare sector, but to CEOs and boards
2123.94s - 2128.66s |  of directors, to understand that we need to make this pivot from nuisance to necessity
2128.66s - 2133.54s |  when it comes to the patching, upgrading, and frankly cybersecurity at large. We've made some
2133.54s - 2138.66s |  progress. I talk to a lot of healthcare CEOs these days that are talking to me about their attack
2138.66s - 2143.14s |  surface, which frankly, the fact that those two words are coming out of their mouth in that order
2143.14s - 2147.22s |  is a wonderful thing, right? It means that they are acknowledging the fact that this is an issue.
2147.22s - 2151.46s |  The fact that they know who their CISOs are and they're having these conversations is a huge step
2151.46s - 2155.30s |  forward, but it's only the tip of the iceberg when you look at the breadth and scope of the
2155.30s - 2162.34s |  healthcare sector of where we need to go. Awesome. All right. So who here feels a
2162.34s - 2166.26s |  little... I mean, I promise we started at cake. Now we're talking about depressing stuff,
2166.26s - 2172.74s |  but I'm trying to bounce it back up a little bit and say, how many of you out there would volunteer
2172.74s - 2177.94s |  with the skills you have as a hacker to try to make this problem better? Raise your hand.
2178.74s - 2182.26s |  Yeah, that's awesome. I hope to see almost all your hands in the future. Many of you are already,
2183.22s - 2188.98s |  but let's talk about kind of what you can do a little bit or maybe where I think in some sense
2188.98s - 2193.38s |  we've seen some great growth in hackers involved in this and maybe we can do a little bit more.
2194.18s - 2199.62s |  So it's been over 15 years of great medical device cybersecurity research. Devices like
2199.62s - 2206.66s |  pacemakers, insulin pumps, all sorts of stuff has been shown at places like this. Barnaby Jack,
2206.74s - 2211.14s |  Jay Radcliffe, Billy Rios and others. These are names that we talk about at Def Con and Black Hat
2211.86s - 2217.62s |  and they contributed to these tremendous leaps in what happened at the FDA or what happened in the
2217.62s - 2221.86s |  national conversation about medical device cybersecurity and that came from folks like you.
2221.86s - 2227.38s |  It came from hackers. You guys did something, you showed others and it caused some amazing
2227.38s - 2233.62s |  action to happen. But stuff's kind of changed a little bit. Anyone seen a really good medical
2233.62s - 2242.10s |  device hack on a big stage at Black Hat or Def Con recently? No. The question I have is we have
2242.10s - 2245.62s |  great spaces like the Biohacking Village. If you haven't had a chance to check it out, you definitely
2245.62s - 2250.42s |  should where hackers get their hands on medical devices. But do we need to do more? Do we need
2250.42s - 2255.46s |  to be giving more medical devices, more exposure to the folks in this room that have that power
2256.26s - 2264.74s |  and maybe do what Jay and Kevin Fu and others did 10 years ago to change things? So to the audience,
2264.74s - 2269.46s |  what should we do? How do we get these folks out here more engaged in medical devices or
2269.46s - 2271.70s |  healthcare cybersecurity infrastructure or whistleblower?
2274.10s - 2279.46s |  I mean, I think if Apple could provide security researchers with devices, even if there is some
2279.46s - 2284.18s |  rigmarole to get access to them, the idea that you could get access to firmware for
2284.18s - 2288.50s |  medical devices, the model that the Biohacking Village has started feels like something that we
2288.50s - 2294.02s |  can scale and we could scale and have a significant impact and do it really in a very, once again,
2294.02s - 2298.02s |  very collaborative way. There is so much good intent and so much capability in this community
2298.74s - 2305.06s |  and reward success in that space. And just the dividends would be tremendous across the sector.
2305.86s - 2310.02s |  And I think the upfront investment actually wouldn't necessarily be significant if we choose
2310.02s - 2313.62s |  to take that action. It's fundamentally a choice that we need to make first
2314.58s - 2320.58s |  across regulators, manufacturers, research agencies. But if we make that choice,
2320.58s - 2324.26s |  we commit a little bit and I think we will see massive returns very quickly.
2325.70s - 2332.10s |  So let's make that choice. So I'd say from the medical device perspective,
2332.10s - 2338.74s |  there's a great benefit in that the new statutory requirements for connected medical devices
2338.74s - 2344.18s |  includes that the manufacturer has to have a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process
2345.46s - 2351.22s |  so that it should become easier to access people at the company if you're able to
2352.50s - 2358.26s |  identify potential vulnerabilities in a product. I will say one of the challenges and one of the
2359.06s - 2366.58s |  things that the people that you named had an immense amount of patience,
2367.62s - 2375.62s |  especially for the older products that take longer to patch that had older devices,
2376.74s - 2382.82s |  devices that don't have as easy delivery mechanisms for patching and updates
2383.38s - 2390.50s |  in order to ensure patient safety in that responsible disclosure of the vulnerabilities.
2390.50s - 2397.78s |  Sometimes those take time in order to process and have the manufacturer develop patches to
2397.78s - 2404.82s |  address the issues. But now that coordinated vulnerability disclosure is a requirement for
2404.82s - 2410.66s |  new products, that should become a easier process. But definitely keep in mind that there is that
2410.66s - 2418.58s |  patient safety aspect that may cause the disclosure to take a little longer than you would
2418.58s - 2425.86s |  like. But you can still go through the process, still engage with the manufacturer, still get
2425.86s - 2432.66s |  the appropriate credit and while maintaining that patient safety consideration. Just kind of a
2432.66s - 2436.82s |  follow-up to that. I think talking to folks in the security research community, especially if we're
2436.82s - 2441.30s |  looking at academic research, access to devices is the number one reason that we don't, I think,
2441.30s - 2447.30s |  see more work in this space. And there are a lot of... They're clapping for you, but they're next
2447.30s - 2452.42s |  door. Not everyone at DEF CON is clapping for me when I'm talking. I appreciate the vibe though.
2455.78s - 2460.82s |  If you don't have access to any of the kind of artifacts of a device, it is very hard to assess
2460.82s - 2468.10s |  its security properties. And I think that's where we see... If controlling the ecosystem
2469.54s - 2475.78s |  may be disadvantageous in the long run or limiting access, providing more avenues for controlled
2475.78s - 2481.78s |  access or just identifying what level of control is actually necessary to maintain whatever interest
2481.78s - 2488.02s |  you have in the device's safety in your own business, whatever. I think reassessing those
2488.02s - 2494.82s |  parameters and then engaging more with the community. Grad students can do a whole lot of
2494.82s - 2501.38s |  really good work for not a whole lot of money. Thank the NSF and NIH. We can see via their work
2501.38s - 2505.94s |  in other spaces, in other sectors even, other critical infrastructure sectors. So we have the
2505.94s - 2511.54s |  ability, we have the talent and we know kind of what it costs. So I think unleashing and kind of
2511.54s - 2516.98s |  building more work in that space could be a very cost effective and also security effective way
2516.98s - 2523.06s |  of getting more kind of progress here. But once again, it requires the choice to kind of open
2523.06s - 2527.78s |  yourself up to that relationship and that community. So yeah, that's something that I
2527.78s - 2531.62s |  spend a lot of time thinking about because you're right, right? We don't see that a lot. Like
2531.62s - 2536.02s |  the Biohacking Village is very unique kind of in this respect or there are other efforts across
2536.02s - 2541.78s |  the nation. I'm not trying to discount those, but we could do more. Absolutely. You shouldn't have
2541.78s - 2549.30s |  to hack on your own medical device that you own and that helps you be alive to do cool
2549.30s - 2556.50s |  cutting edge research, right? You shouldn't have to go on eBay and buy the only device available
2556.50s - 2560.74s |  for you in a device category that's 10 years old or 15 years old and has, of course you're
2560.74s - 2564.98s |  going to find stuff because you can't get your hands on the latest and greatest. You know, I
2564.98s - 2571.54s |  really wonder if that's holding us back. And it's just then a game of if I could get a hold of it,
2571.54s - 2575.30s |  I could find something, but I'm not going to, and it's going to just float along. We miss an
2575.30s - 2581.70s |  opportunity to really make some meaningful change earlier. So that's a plea to the audience. Get
2581.70s - 2586.10s |  involved. Who would take a medical device home and wrench on it if you could? Yeah. Hell yeah.
2587.38s - 2593.14s |  No drug delivery pumps for you guys though. Okay. No fentanyl pumps. All right. All right.
2593.22s - 2601.78s |  Consolidation. Okay. Here we go. Smaller. Give me a, I want to audience poll real quick.
2602.34s - 2606.50s |  Raise your hand if you think the profit margins of most hospitals in this country is over 20%.
2606.50s - 2616.58s |  Raise your hand. All right. Keep your hand up. 10%. 5%. 1%. Yeah. You guys know. It's about 1%.
2616.98s - 2623.06s |  Sub 1%. Meaning your hospital makes a profit margin probably between 1% and 4%.
2625.06s - 2627.54s |  And then if they don't, if they screw something up, they go red.
2628.26s - 2633.22s |  More and more hospitals are getting financially distressed. And I want to just hear if anyone in
2633.22s - 2638.02s |  this audience knows what happens. You have a hospital system. It's in the red. And then what
2638.02s - 2642.74s |  is it going to do to survive? Is it going to see more patients or become more efficient?
2643.54s - 2648.98s |  No, it's going to get bought. It's going to get consolidated.
2650.34s - 2654.50s |  What happens when hospital system A buys hospital system B? Do you think they're
2654.50s - 2659.38s |  going to have two different entire technology stacks? No, they're going to unify under one
2659.38s - 2666.26s |  stack, right? What happens when more and more hospitals are just part of more and more mega
2666.26s - 2671.70s |  healthcare delivery organization conglomerates and one of them gets hit. And then not only is
2671.70s - 2677.70s |  it then one or two hospitals that are down, it's 200 over four states. The question I have
2678.42s - 2681.86s |  is from a national security perspective, as something that we should do from folks
2681.86s - 2686.98s |  are interested in this, making sure hospitals can function, how should we look at the consolidation
2686.98s - 2690.90s |  of healthcare delivery organizations when it comes to risk of catastrophic failure?
2690.90s - 2696.74s |  And is there anything we can do when hospital systems try to marry one another that could
2696.74s - 2702.58s |  limit this? So to the panel. Also I'll offer, I think we are looking at this and having a lot
2702.58s - 2706.74s |  of conversations about really understanding risk. I think we look at risk in not necessarily the
2706.74s - 2710.82s |  right light when it comes to cybersecurity. I look at risk as a three-legged stool.
2711.38s - 2714.82s |  There's risk identification, we spend a lot of time on that. There's risk mitigation,
2714.82s - 2718.42s |  we spend a lot of time on that. The third leg of the stool is risk acceptance.
2718.98s - 2723.70s |  And we don't spend enough time understanding the risks that we're accepting in our organizations
2723.70s - 2728.98s |  by not investing in cybersecurity or modernization and infrastructure. That risk
2728.98s - 2734.34s |  acceptance is not the CISO. That risk acceptance is the CEOs and the boards of directors of
2734.34s - 2739.54s |  organizations that are deciding to not invest. I get the margins issue. I worked in healthcare,
2740.66s - 2745.06s |  we were never even in the 1%. So I think that's a good, we would love to have been in the 1%.
2746.74s - 2751.30s |  So I think that there's those types of challenges that folks are balancing against, but people need
2751.30s - 2755.70s |  to understand the risks that they're accepting. I will say that we are hearing more healthcare
2755.70s - 2762.18s |  organizations talking about tech debt and cyber risk in the M&A process. They're having these
2762.18s - 2766.50s |  discussions of saying, we want to buy this healthcare system or this hospital, and we know
2766.50s - 2772.10s |  that it's going to cost us 2 million, 3 million, 4 million to get their IT to the standards that
2772.10s - 2777.30s |  we have set within our organization. And they're building that into the M&A discussion when it
2777.30s - 2781.62s |  comes to that. Now, that being said, that's a small fraction of the conversations that are
2781.62s - 2785.06s |  happening. So I think it's a multi-pronged approach. One, we want to make sure that we're
2785.06s - 2790.58s |  able to get that message out to folks and change the way that we're looking at M&A within healthcare
2790.58s - 2796.02s |  so that people are factoring in tech debt and cybersecurity as part of that dialogue. And I
2796.02s - 2800.26s |  think the other piece of it is making sure that we understand, going back to the first question
2800.26s - 2806.50s |  about mapping out the sector, where are those key dependencies where something is, we know this
2806.50s - 2811.86s |  with the HR, we know this, obviously it would change, but there's other types of events that
2811.86s - 2816.66s |  we don't know what's out there, where there's these entities that have such large market share
2816.66s - 2821.30s |  that the impact of one becomes an impact to more than we can tolerate in healthcare. We need to
2821.30s - 2826.50s |  know that so we can start having those discussions of buying down that risk or going in collectively
2826.50s - 2830.90s |  and accepting that risk. And we have not been able to do that effectively yet where we need to
2830.90s - 2842.06s |  in the healthcare sector. Oh, mergers and acquisitions. Sorry. Thank you. Anyone else? I'd say
2843.98s - 2849.98s |  in terms of consolidation, I'd say what can we learn from other international models where there
2849.98s - 2857.66s |  are single payer systems that have large networks of facilities? Are there things that we can learn
2857.66s - 2863.66s |  to address some of those risks based off of what we see them do well or them have issues with? And
2863.66s - 2873.34s |  how can we adopt what has worked well or improve upon what hasn't? But I'd say it's definitely
2873.34s - 2879.34s |  something we need to pay careful attention to and see what protections can be in place to
2879.34s - 2886.62s |  isolate facilities in case one gets hit to ensure that continuity of care, especially if it's in
2887.34s - 2891.98s |  an overlapping region, you don't want to lose an entire region of facilities
2893.50s - 2900.62s |  based off of it hitting the central core facility or just affecting the entire network.
2900.62s - 2909.58s |  So how can we get better detection and automated response capabilities in order to cut off those
2909.58s - 2915.63s |  networks when exposed? All right. I want to make sure we can get through some questions here.
2916.35s - 2920.59s |  And this has a whistleblower component, I think, which is the interesting part. I'd like to
2920.59s - 2927.57s |  pull on that a little bit in here. For years, we have known very little in what happens inside
2927.57s - 2932.29s |  hospitals that have been hit with ransomware. Every once in a while, you'll get a news report
2932.29s - 2936.93s |  that says an attack happened and you'll hear some updated news reports that the attack's still going
2936.93s - 2941.97s |  on. Maybe you'll get an anonymous quote from a doctor or nurse that worked at the hospital. But
2941.97s - 2946.37s |  for the longest times, we had no idea, really, with rare exception. Maybe I'm just going to
2946.37s - 2951.09s |  shout out University of Vermont, right? They've been incredibly transparent in their attack.
2951.09s - 2956.85s |  Well, as a consequence of not sharing that information very openly and exhaustively is
2956.85s - 2961.09s |  we don't get lessons learned, right? We don't know what happened when they're taking care of
2961.09s - 2965.89s |  their diabetic patients that were in a crisis or their heart attacks or their strokes. We don't
2965.89s - 2973.73s |  really learn like we should. And there are some organizations like ISACs and these types of things.
2973.73s - 2984.19s |  But clearly, there seems to be an information vacuum. Do we offer some additional legal
2984.19s - 2989.55s |  protections, some type of additional efforts that we can do to make health systems feel more
2989.55s - 2995.47s |  comfortable about talking about their failures so other people can learn from it? To the audience,
2995.47s - 3001.71s |  or sorry, to the panel. So I think you see in other domains where people make upfront
3001.71s - 3007.71s |  disclosures that say if they are in violation of some sort of tenant, like foreign corrupt practices,
3007.71s - 3013.07s |  that there will be leniencies in terms of the fees that they might incur. But I think it is
3013.07s - 3018.11s |  to this point of like getting that board buy-in, getting that executive buy-in to say like mistakes
3018.11s - 3023.39s |  are going to be made and we're here to fix them. And that there's an immense amount of power
3023.39s - 3029.31s |  in deconstructing the narrative of exactly what went wrong and the details of that. Because even
3029.31s - 3035.15s |  for a cybersecurity failure, it's not just one or two things. It's probably a list of 30 different
3035.15s - 3042.83s |  decisions that were made and being able to have really clear granularity of who made what
3042.83s - 3049.95s |  decisions, who was affected, who was unaware. Whatever those details are, being very explicit,
3049.95s - 3055.55s |  very clear, and really being able to dig in the weeds of those retrospective analysis.
3055.55s - 3060.35s |  And not only sharing them internally with those organizations, but also externally
3060.91s - 3067.07s |  to other people who work in the cybersecurity industry is immensely helpful. But I think
3067.07s - 3073.63s |  psychologically very hard, right? It's hard even though you may be valued by other cybersecurity
3073.63s - 3079.71s |  professionals for being transparent and open and admitting a mistake. The public perception of that
3079.71s - 3086.27s |  could be seen while you were in negligent or everything else. And that sort of shift in people's
3086.27s - 3092.67s |  perception of when people make mistakes is also a bit of a challenge there. So you can see that
3092.67s - 3096.35s |  there's maybe some sort of incentivization structure that you can create to say you'll
3096.35s - 3101.47s |  get leniency if you're very clear at reporting what went wrong, how it went wrong in very,
3101.47s - 3107.15s |  very specified details. Or alternatively, again, it's like this is a deliberate decision
3108.03s - 3112.75s |  typically by people in positions of leadership to say transparency is important to us.
3112.75s - 3117.79s |  Being able to say we are engineers, we are going to fail, that is a nature of engineering,
3117.79s - 3123.55s |  but we are also here to fix. And this is how we fixed it. And for the benefit of our industry,
3124.11s - 3130.51s |  here is the details of how we resolved that issue. And I think having those case studies
3130.91s - 3134.51s |  is crucially important for basically any field that you're really in.
3135.63s - 3141.15s |  But it's a tricky problem, right? Because it's a public perception, it's a liability issue
3141.71s - 3146.35s |  or perceived liability issue. And it's like, how do you overcome those hurdles
3146.91s - 3150.91s |  is more of a people problem, I would see than a technical problem.
3154.91s - 3157.23s |  Yeah, it's been a technical problem at the end of the day.
3158.19s - 3163.47s |  I think I'm kind of building on that, like, looking at the FAA and how we deal with aviation
3163.47s - 3168.11s |  incidents. I mean, I think there was a recognition that the entire industry, like if people did not
3168.11s - 3173.15s |  feel safe flying, that entire sector would collapse. And so the need for transparency,
3173.15s - 3178.27s |  the processes that have been put in place, like, are they perfect? Probably not. I'm not an expert
3178.27s - 3182.11s |  in that field. But there is a high degree of industry and government cooperation. There's a
3182.83s - 3188.11s |  high degree of transparency. There's a high degree of kind of forensic capacity built into
3188.99s - 3195.79s |  the systems that we use to ensure commercial flight. And so, or like the NTSB kind of to a
3195.79s - 3200.43s |  lesser degree, but like things that we have decided are necessary for the economy for like the nation
3200.43s - 3205.79s |  to kind of like, move forward every day, we find a way to achieve more transparency and more
3205.79s - 3211.07s |  cooperation. And so it'd be really interesting just to see, you know, how can we do that for
3211.07s - 3218.67s |  healthcare? Because this is also a necessity. Very, very complex one. But I think the fundamental
3218.67s - 3227.44s |  kind of like problem and maybe the solution looks similar. All right. I've gotten the less than five
3227.44s - 3230.56s |  minutes. I know we had talked a little bit about a Q&A, but I don't think we're going to be able
3230.56s - 3236.00s |  to take a Q&A. Is that correct? Yeah, unfortunately not. Blame this person. I'm just kidding. Blame
3236.00s - 3240.56s |  me. The monitor. What I will offer is I'll be available in the back. We want to be respectful
3240.64s - 3244.96s |  to the next speakers. I can't guarantee any of these folks are very busy. They may or may not
3244.96s - 3249.60s |  be able to answer some questions, but I want to say from the bottom of my heart, and I hope you
3249.60s - 3254.64s |  out there agree. Thank you so much for coming and giving us your knowledge today on this very
3254.64s - 3256.88s |  complicated topic. Everyone give him a round of applause.
