**Introduction**
- **Psychic Paper**: Using e-ink and e-paper displays to replicate identification badges.

**E-Ink and E-Paper Displays**
- **E-Ink**: An electromechanical device that requires power to move but can retain an image without power.
- **E-Paper**: Similar to e-ink but with a higher resolution and a wider range of colors.
- **Traditional Displays**: OLED and LCD displays emit light and require a constant power source.

**Three-Color E-Ink Displays**
- **Availability**: Easily sourced from Amazon and Alibaba.
- **Reprogrammable**: Requires a specific process involving a Hong Kong IP address, a VPN, and siloing the APK.
- **NFC**: The cards have 125 kHz NFC, but the aluminum tape can interfere with RFID technology.

**Five-Color E-Paper Prototype**
- **Higher Fidelity**: The prototype uses a WaveShare ePaper ESP32 circuit board and display, providing a higher resolution image.
- **Bezel**: The purple bezel can be concealed with a wallet and double-sided tape.
- **Raspberry Pi**: Can be used for online programming, but the setup is finicky and requires a specific order.
- **Driver Board**: The ESP32 driver board is inexpensive (<$40) and supports Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
- **RFID Reprogramming**: A Proxmark or a forgotten hotel badge can provide RFID cards for reprogramming.

**Bill of Materials**
- **E-Paper Display**: $30-$40.
- **Wallet**: $30.
- **Programmer**: $20.
- **Total**: Around $200.

**Programming Software**
- **Arduino Scratch**: Provided by WaveShare, works best with the previous Arduino version, and a Windows machine.
- **Arduino IDE**: Had issues with programming, especially on a Mac.
- **Bluetooth and Wi-Fi**: Both available on the ESP32 but require an internet connection to set up.

**Conclusion**
- The presenter showcases a prototype of a five-color e-paper display that can be used for social engineering and red teaming purposes.
- The prototype combines the e-paper display with RFID cloning techniques to create a realistic and functional replica of an employee ID badge.
