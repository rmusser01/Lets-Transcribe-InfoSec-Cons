  "description": "Storytelling of a highly complex Red Team with multiple initial accesses only with Social Engineering. could anyone do it? Yes.\n\nUnder the format of Storytelling this presentation aims to take attendees first person through a RedTeam service with multiple initial accesses with 100% Social Engineering. How to present critical vulnerabilities in a public way without exposing the target company? This live comic will show us how, through one of its protagonists and with practical examples made with the attendees themselves. How does a professional Social Engineering unit work? What are the roles and tasks? How to emulate the reach of a cybercriminal gang in less than three weeks? This dojo aims to show the methodologies and techniques applied in the field to obtain relevant findings, even reaching critical infrastructure without raising alerts and in an extremely limited time. From the first meeting with the client, information gathering, vector selection, exploitation, pretexting to the physical intrusion, even reaching the datacenter. We will demonstrate how luck is no longer an element to consider when your work is SE from Monday to Friday and you have to perform this type of service every month.",

0.00s - 2.30s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Okay, welcome everybody.
2.30s - 4.74s |  So if you're like me and you grew up with the Ninja Turtles,
4.74s - 6.74s |  you're gonna be really excited about this one.
6.74s - 10.98s |  We've got Daniel Eisler on behalf of Adversary Village,
10.98s - 13.78s |  Master Splinter's Initial Physical Access Dojo,
13.78s - 16.66s |  Storytelling of Complex Adversarial.
16.66s - 24.28s |  Thanks so much and here we go.
24.28s - 27.02s |  Hi, maybe most of you don't know me.
27.02s - 31.98s |  And as you can see, I don't speak very well English.
32.14s - 35.18s |  So I hope you enjoy this talk.
35.18s - 38.32s |  Before I start, well, you already see it,
38.32s - 80.34s |  but it's important this very first announce.
80.34s - 83.30s |  Welcome, I am the Master Splinter.
83.30s - 86.58s |  And no, I'm not coming from the Comic Con.
86.58s - 90.94s |  You can call me Rad, Splinter, Danny, or Daniel.
91.94s - 93.02s |  Oh, awesome.
93.02s - 93.84s |  Hello, hello.
95.32s - 96.72s |  Okay.
96.72s - 97.56s |  Yeah, yeah.
98.52s - 103.16s |  Since 2015, I'm the team leader of Friendly Rats,
103.16s - 104.66s |  the social engineering unit
104.66s - 106.74s |  at DreamLab Technologies in Chile.
108.30s - 109.80s |  Friendly Rats, DreamLab.
110.94s - 113.24s |  I have the honor to present several cons.
113.24s - 115.54s |  I don't know if you, you hear me?
115.54s - 116.64s |  No, not too much.
117.48s - 118.68s |  Yeah.
118.68s - 120.94s |  I, okay, that's it.
122.72s - 125.52s |  Several cons associated with social engineering,
125.54s - 129.36s |  such as Ecoparty in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
130.46s - 133.36s |  Osintomatico in Madrid, in Spain,
133.36s - 136.26s |  Layer 8 in Rhode Island.
136.26s - 139.72s |  And with a lot of nervous and joy,
139.72s - 144.44s |  I will be, now is my fifth time presenting at DEFCON.
144.44s - 147.10s |  So thank you, Adversary Village.
148.70s - 153.38s |  Today, I'm gonna need the help of two volunteers
153.44s - 156.70s |  who wants to be real rats, ninja rats.
156.70s - 161.54s |  So to be more faster, I have,
161.54s - 164.18s |  no, no, but raise your hand, two persons.
164.18s - 167.08s |  I have one, two, okay.
167.08s - 168.52s |  Thank you, buddy.
168.52s - 170.52s |  No, no, but I will call you.
170.52s - 171.62s |  Thanks, thanks.
171.62s - 173.12s |  Don't go.
173.12s - 181.32s |  So welcome to the dojo.
181.32s - 183.62s |  Okay, all rats are welcome.
183.64s - 186.84s |  I could assure that everyone here
186.84s - 190.58s |  has social engineering success story.
190.58s - 192.48s |  I'm sure you're treasure it,
194.12s - 197.82s |  even share it as an accomplishment or an adventure.
197.82s - 201.30s |  In fact, I love to hear that stories after this
201.30s - 203.40s |  with a beer, if you like.
203.40s - 206.60s |  Now, I invite you to imagine that.
206.60s - 210.90s |  Not the beer, the story of social engineering.
210.92s - 215.92s |  And imagine that like a day job, like us,
217.06s - 219.76s |  Monday through Friday, all year long.
219.76s - 223.54s |  That's why our first adage will be,
223.54s - 226.78s |  there's no such a thing as luck.
226.78s - 230.30s |  I don't know if you can say that in Vegas,
230.30s - 233.08s |  but we don't trust in luck.
236.04s - 239.28s |  What I will try to do today is to share with you
239.30s - 242.70s |  how training, preparation, techniques and methods
242.70s - 246.44s |  can help in a social engineering service or in a red team.
246.44s - 250.54s |  So you can finally decide if luck really exists or not.
250.54s - 253.82s |  It's difficult to make an eye-catching story
253.82s - 258.72s |  when it has only existed in a report format.
258.72s - 261.92s |  As you will see, I will do my best.
263.46s - 267.76s |  So, it all starts in another country
267.78s - 272.78s |  with a critical infrastructure company of that nation.
273.92s - 275.42s |  We never expect to meet a client
275.42s - 278.46s |  who is really willing to give us a clue
279.50s - 282.06s |  as to what we are going to face.
282.06s - 285.96s |  He just point us to a few possible locations
285.96s - 287.66s |  where they might be found.
288.64s - 291.54s |  Control rooms, sorry, control rooms,
291.54s - 296.54s |  monitoring rooms, machine rooms, offices and data center.
298.22s - 303.22s |  One of the first thing we found in the assessment stage
304.88s - 309.88s |  was that due to the type of service this client provide,
310.48s - 314.06s |  in the case of any unusual activity
314.06s - 318.86s |  or unauthorized personnel, the collaborators,
318.86s - 323.14s |  any of them were authorized to reduce
323.14s - 325.94s |  or at least detain the intruder
325.96s - 329.92s |  until certain forces arrived.
333.56s - 336.96s |  We start the first week with information gathering,
336.96s - 343.21s |  focusing in the following three findings.
343.21s - 345.13s |  Corporate ID.
345.13s - 347.73s |  Thanks to a post in social networks,
347.73s - 352.73s |  we found a 3.2 feet long version of the corporate ID
353.01s - 357.03s |  with the personal ID of each of one of the developers.
358.41s - 361.77s |  The second one was relevant profiles
361.77s - 364.13s |  with exposed information.
364.13s - 369.13s |  We identified four strategic collaborators account
369.37s - 374.37s |  for identity impersonation and possible authorizations.
375.65s - 380.65s |  And the third one was weak accesses and credentials.
380.73s - 383.41s |  We found an internal login
383.41s - 385.89s |  without two-factor authentication
385.91s - 389.59s |  with the possibility of several consecutive attempts
389.59s - 392.05s |  to enter wrong credentials.
392.05s - 396.97s |  So maybe some, you know what happened with that.
398.11s - 400.77s |  The human, humans, sorry.
401.63s - 406.63s |  At this stage, it's very important to consider
407.23s - 411.27s |  as burned the rat performing the interaction
411.27s - 414.03s |  in the field for information gathering.
414.03s - 417.25s |  He can't be part of the physical intrusion
417.25s - 421.17s |  because collaborators could recognize him or her.
422.57s - 426.69s |  This phase allows us to achieve two findings.
426.69s - 431.33s |  First, the ID and the uniform design.
431.33s - 434.25s |  We validated the design was the same
434.25s - 439.01s |  as the one we found in the publication, in the post.
439.01s - 443.21s |  Second one, we want to check if indeed
443.21s - 445.81s |  the attitude of the cats,
449.03s - 452.99s |  if one of us perform an inappropriate action.
452.99s - 457.99s |  So the burned rat took a picture of one of the accesses.
461.31s - 463.99s |  In less than two minutes,
463.99s - 466.75s |  he had one of the cats on his back,
466.75s - 468.51s |  almost breaking the camera
468.51s - 470.67s |  and demanding to delete the picture.
470.67s - 472.39s |  So it's gonna be tough.
474.07s - 476.27s |  How we organize in our unit?
477.27s - 479.65s |  To deal with any type of service,
479.65s - 481.61s |  we use the following distribution.
482.83s - 485.79s |  We have four kind of consultants.
485.79s - 490.19s |  Support, they are the ones who will immediately respond
490.19s - 492.99s |  to all the requests needed by the alpha team,
492.99s - 497.31s |  like information, supplies, mobilization,
497.31s - 499.67s |  buy some stuff, et cetera.
499.67s - 502.23s |  The queue, like the queue agent.
502.25s - 504.77s |  They are in charge for preparation devices,
504.77s - 509.77s |  payloads, scripts, wifi, malicious webpage, et cetera.
510.81s - 515.25s |  Then the alpha can be one or an alpha team.
515.25s - 518.23s |  There are experts in exploitation, execution,
518.23s - 521.05s |  capture, cloning and exfiltration,
521.05s - 523.29s |  recovery and access enabling.
524.17s - 528.17s |  And the last one, anyone here,
528.17s - 530.61s |  you could be one of these ones today.
531.59s - 533.39s |  Cover.
533.39s - 536.63s |  We work with freelance consultants,
536.63s - 541.63s |  from psychologists to actors, dogs to elderly people.
541.99s - 546.07s |  We use, one time my son used to work too,
546.07s - 547.35s |  with five years old.
548.47s - 550.91s |  The resorts are always good,
550.91s - 554.75s |  as they are not emotionally charged or stressed
554.75s - 556.73s |  about the success of the service.
557.55s - 561.19s |  The comments, their comments are usually,
561.19s - 564.23s |  this is the most fun I ever had,
564.23s - 569.23s |  or I wouldn't have imagined it will be so easy.
571.71s - 573.67s |  When they say that,
573.67s - 577.39s |  I start to see the hateful faces of the rats.
577.39s - 581.95s |  So I explained them that it looks easy,
581.95s - 584.91s |  thanks to the hard work of all the rats.
584.93s - 588.85s |  That's why they managed to get inside the data center,
588.85s - 593.49s |  manager's office or implant a device in a critical area.
593.49s - 596.33s |  So now you know our team.
597.47s - 601.21s |  So this was the plan or the organization.
601.21s - 603.53s |  The uniform used by the cats
603.53s - 606.85s |  was not available for sale to public.
606.85s - 611.85s |  So our custom designer made her own research
613.13s - 614.49s |  to generate replicas.
615.07s - 617.11s |  So yes, we have a custom designer.
618.19s - 622.43s |  As you can see, it is necessary for the details,
622.43s - 627.43s |  including the natural aging and soiling of each uniform.
628.75s - 633.75s |  You can't always buy online or trust online stores.
636.91s - 640.95s |  This always happen when you buy online stores a uniform.
640.95s - 642.55s |  So don't do it.
643.45s - 645.51s |  Found a custom designer.
646.89s - 649.45s |  So what gonna do the Alpha team?
649.45s - 653.33s |  They gonna dress like a central office collaborator.
653.33s - 656.37s |  They will show up under the pretext
656.37s - 661.37s |  of undertaking a review of sanitization protocols
662.93s - 665.37s |  associated with COVID-19.
665.37s - 672.13s |  Of course, this project took place in that time.
672.13s - 676.83s |  Q, during the second week, our Q guys
678.87s - 683.11s |  focus on four strategic profile email accounts.
683.11s - 688.11s |  Probably everyone is familiar with this kind of tools.
689.59s - 694.59s |  Who doesn't know, you can customize password dictionaries
694.71s - 697.55s |  for brute force attack.
697.55s - 702.55s |  So we achieve an effective access for four accounts
702.57s - 704.97s |  thanks to the low restrictions
704.97s - 706.91s |  on the weak password settings.
708.45s - 710.97s |  Those were the results.
710.97s - 715.97s |  So nothing very complex for these critical accounts.
717.87s - 720.27s |  What gonna make support?
720.27s - 723.37s |  Once inside of the email account,
723.37s - 726.53s |  we blacklist or spam all the people
726.53s - 728.77s |  where we are going to contact.
729.55s - 732.99s |  Support team should permanently check the spam mailbox.
732.99s - 736.91s |  And if they receive an email from one of these contacts,
736.91s - 738.61s |  respond as soon as possible
738.61s - 742.07s |  and delete both the spam email and the sent email.
742.07s - 744.05s |  So it's invisible for the user.
747.83s - 750.63s |  And another lethal weapon that we have,
753.19s - 756.51s |  it will seem maybe absurd for you,
756.51s - 760.89s |  but we register the phone number of our team
760.89s - 765.33s |  with the name of the user of the compromised email account.
765.33s - 770.33s |  So the phone call will be displayed the name in the screen.
773.41s - 776.41s |  I know it sounds basic, but believe me,
776.41s - 779.95s |  in a real scenario, it can save everything.
781.73s - 786.73s |  Cover, few days before the execution,
786.75s - 791.23s |  we sent on a script, a manual on protocols
791.23s - 794.03s |  on preventive measures for COVID-19
794.03s - 796.19s |  to our covering consultant.
797.55s - 802.55s |  As a guideline, he were to be 100% focused on coverage.
803.51s - 808.51s |  That is lead conversation, initiate presentations
808.51s - 810.91s |  and argue about our presence,
810.91s - 817.18s |  perform distraction actions to support the alpha team.
817.18s - 820.76s |  So in the preparation day, we met with the rats
820.76s - 824.30s |  to review objectives and all relevant information.
824.30s - 829.30s |  Names, position, contacts, roles, custom props,
830.46s - 834.72s |  technical language, pretext, possible situations,
834.72s - 836.50s |  issues and solutions.
837.60s - 842.60s |  And the last added value, it's a powerful weapon.
842.94s - 847.94s |  More than the phone, a nice but lethal sticker
848.74s - 853.74s |  for each collaborator who was going to interact with us
853.80s - 855.20s |  during the activity.
855.20s - 859.00s |  That is a principle of reciprocity, it's so strong.
860.06s - 863.72s |  So let's start, execution day.
864.58s - 867.94s |  Support team, two consultants, one in the field
867.96s - 872.96s |  and other remotely managing respectively the email account
874.76s - 879.76s |  and a telephone to impersonate the user profile.
881.22s - 884.96s |  The alpha team was composed of two consultants,
884.96s - 889.40s |  a cover consultant who will pretend to be our boss
889.40s - 891.08s |  and two other alpha.
892.44s - 895.64s |  We arrive in the first access.
895.64s - 897.90s |  The alpha team identified itself
897.90s - 900.38s |  as a corporate office staff.
900.38s - 903.18s |  With technical language, we speak with the guard
903.18s - 907.90s |  ending with, don't worry, we already know the facility.
907.90s - 912.02s |  The guard revealed allows us access
912.02s - 915.14s |  upon seeing our uniforms and credentials.
915.14s - 917.86s |  So it is important to understand
917.86s - 921.06s |  that once you are a interlocutor
921.06s - 924.46s |  that considers you trusty person
924.46s - 929.58s |  or better yet, someone who can resolve situation.
929.58s - 931.14s |  Yeah, yeah.
931.14s - 934.74s |  Then you're standing in a privileged place.
934.74s - 938.10s |  The guard looked at us with appreciation
938.10s - 944.40s |  and announced over the radio that we were going on our own.
944.40s - 949.16s |  Okay, upon entering, we found ourselves in a maze.
950.24s - 953.04s |  We knew we didn't have to look like strangers
953.04s - 954.78s |  so we keep walking naturally.
955.74s - 958.02s |  We walk through several corridors
958.02s - 960.30s |  until we research a security door
960.30s - 962.02s |  with proximity card opening
962.02s - 964.78s |  with two factors of authentication.
964.78s - 969.54s |  We stop in front of the access simulating a conversation
969.54s - 972.42s |  until a cat appeared.
972.42s - 977.42s |  A maintenance technician carrying a large number of boxes.
978.20s - 983.20s |  So we obviously very kindly help him to open the door.
984.90s - 989.66s |  On the other side was an armed guard cat
989.66s - 993.10s |  who saw us in complicity with the technician
993.10s - 995.74s |  plus the uniforms and credentials.
996.70s - 1000.38s |  He went from the angry cat gesture, you know,
1000.38s - 1005.38s |  as a simple raised eyebrow of a cat who had just eaten.
1009.71s - 1012.19s |  So we advanced through the corridors,
1012.19s - 1017.19s |  very similar to those in Dead Star or Jurassic Park
1017.63s - 1022.63s |  or Resident Evil with double doors and control accesses.
1023.87s - 1028.87s |  So we knock at a crystal door and a cat on duty appeared.
1031.15s - 1034.39s |  Here it's very important for you to understand
1034.39s - 1037.27s |  what is going on in the minds
1037.27s - 1041.79s |  and behavior of our consultants.
1042.39s - 1044.87s |  The cover must be 100% focused
1044.87s - 1047.83s |  on establishing a situation of comfort
1049.59s - 1051.47s |  and trust with the cat.
1051.47s - 1054.83s |  So it is essential to play the pretext,

1061.79s - 1065.65s |  as a cat, as his companions.

1069.67s - 1073.91s |  a lock, unattended equipment, available network points,
1073.91s - 1077.79s |  access cameras, and printed information.
