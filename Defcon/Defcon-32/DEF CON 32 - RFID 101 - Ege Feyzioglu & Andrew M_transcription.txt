0.00s - 3.00s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Alright everyone, thank you so much for coming to the RFID talk.
3.00s - 7.00s |  This is going to be a quick introduction to how RFID works
7.00s - 11.00s |  and what you can do to, you know, play around with it,
11.00s - 14.00s |  have a little fun and
14.00s - 18.00s |  hopefully we will end with some
18.00s - 23.00s |  suggestions on how we can make RFID a little bit safer
23.00s - 26.00s |  and what the common problems are.
26.00s - 29.00s |  And then we're going to end with a quick demonstration on
29.00s - 32.00s |  how to use the Flipper Zero. I'm sure
32.00s - 36.00s |  y'all are very familiar with that. If not, we're going to introduce you to that as well.
36.00s - 40.34s |  So, oh yeah, before that, introductions.
40.34s - 43.34s |  My name is Ege, that's spelled like that,
43.34s - 46.34s |  the top name that you see over there.
46.34s - 48.34s |  We're from the physical security village.
48.34s - 52.34s |  If you like what you see here and would like to see more of the
52.34s - 56.34s |  physical side of, like physical security side of DEF CON,
56.34s - 59.34s |  please be sure to come by the village.
59.34s - 62.34s |  It's going to be in the map and also we're going to be,
62.34s - 66.34s |  you can just walk around and look for people wearing weirdly green shirts.
66.34s - 69.34s |  Thank you. I'm Andrew Marchment.
69.34s - 71.34s |  I'm the second name on there.
71.34s - 75.34s |  I work in the store of the physical security village in the vendor area.
75.34s - 78.34s |  We're very happy to have partnered with
78.34s - 81.34s |  the Keyport guys this year to offer a discount
81.34s - 84.34s |  for people buying Keyport key organizers.
84.34s - 88.34s |  And we're also partnered with Covert Instruments to offer some of their inventory at our store.
89.34s - 92.34s |  So if you've seen Lockpicking Lawyer or McNally
92.34s - 96.34s |  and you want some of those tools, we are retailing them at our store.
96.34s - 98.34s |  So come by later.
98.34s - 102.34s |  My background is in satellite telecom, so I'm more of a high frequency RF guy.
102.34s - 107.34s |  But I'm doing this talk today on how to use the Flipper Zero
107.34s - 112.34s |  and other RFID cloning tools and how RFID works.
112.34s - 115.34s |  So we'll get started.
115.34s - 118.34s |  All right. So yeah, RFID. Sorry about that false start there.
118.34s - 120.34s |  RFID, we see it all around us.
120.34s - 125.34s |  We see it whenever we tap our key fob to get into our building at work.
125.34s - 128.34s |  When we tap our badge, whenever we go on transit
128.34s - 130.34s |  and we use one of those contactless cards
130.34s - 134.34s |  or even when we pay with either, you know, tap with your card
134.34s - 137.34s |  or Apple Pay or Google Wallet or whatever.
137.34s - 141.34s |  But something that we don't necessarily always think about
141.34s - 143.34s |  is how these darn things work.
143.34s - 146.34s |  So you want to run us through it? Sure.
146.34s - 150.34s |  All right. So it's basically a transformer that you're making
150.34s - 153.34s |  when you bring your card up to a reader.
153.34s - 156.34s |  So the reader has a coil of wire
156.34s - 160.34s |  and we're passing an electrical current through that coil at all times.
160.34s - 163.34s |  As that card approaches, we're completing the circuit
163.34s - 168.34s |  and the magnetic field that comes around that original coil
168.34s - 172.34s |  induces a current in the coil inside of your card
172.34s - 175.34s |  and that powers a little chip in there
175.34s - 182.34s |  that actually allows it to respond to the reader with its ID.
182.34s - 186.34s |  Yeah. So this is kind of a simplified view
186.34s - 192.34s |  of what the inside of one of those tags looks like.
192.34s - 196.34s |  What it basically does is it draws more or less current
196.34s - 198.34s |  to send a one or a zero.
198.34s - 201.34s |  There are other ways as well. It gets a little bit more complicated.
201.34s - 204.34s |  But on the very basic end of it, this is what it looks like inside.
204.34s - 206.34s |  And what that looks like,
206.34s - 210.34s |  if you were to measure the magnetic field around it,
210.34s - 213.34s |  is the magnetic field is either high,
213.34s - 216.34s |  like you see how those pulses,
216.34s - 219.34s |  or it's a lower magnetic field measured
219.34s - 223.34s |  because the chip is loading that magnetic field,
223.34s - 225.34s |  drawing energy out of it,
225.34s - 228.34s |  and that is it's talking to the transmitter.
228.34s - 231.34s |  So something obvious that you might realize
231.34s - 235.34s |  is this is very easy to mess with.
235.34s - 238.34s |  If I bring my own loop of wire around it,
238.34s - 240.34s |  and that's actually how I capture that image
240.34s - 243.34s |  that you just saw before,
243.34s - 245.34s |  I'm able to just read that communication.
245.34s - 248.34s |  It's literally just a breadboard jumper wire
248.34s - 250.34s |  that I looped around a bunch of times,
250.34s - 253.34s |  and then I put that near the transmitter and the fob,
253.34s - 255.34s |  and I was able to pick up that communication.
255.34s - 259.34s |  There's no encryption because you can't encrypt physics.
259.34s - 262.34s |  It's either more or less magnetic field,
262.34s - 266.34s |  and it's incredibly trivial to sniff.
266.34s - 271.34s |  Something else is, again, because you can't encrypt physics,
271.34s - 275.34s |  and the moment the tag sees the reader,
275.34s - 277.34s |  it starts blaring out its ID number.
277.34s - 280.34s |  As Andrew said, I can come around with my own reader.
280.34s - 283.34s |  Maybe you might have seen this.
283.34s - 287.34s |  This is a photo from Physical Security Village last year.
287.34s - 289.34s |  We have a similar setup this year.
289.34s - 293.34s |  If you go near the entrance or the exit of the village,
293.34s - 297.34s |  you might see a long-range reader
297.34s - 299.34s |  idly sitting by, sniffing your badges
299.34s - 303.34s |  and putting them on the wall of sheep.
303.34s - 307.62s |  So how can we solve this problem?
307.62s - 309.62s |  Does anyone have any ideas?
309.62s - 316.07s |  Shout them out.
316.07s - 319.07s |  Lasers, I heard.
319.07s - 322.07s |  It's probably going to be a little more difficult to target that,
322.07s - 324.07s |  but yeah, I heard someone say encryption.
324.07s - 327.07s |  Yeah, we solve it using encryption.
327.07s - 332.07s |  So this is how an encrypted communication looks like.
332.07s - 336.07s |  Before everything happens, there has to be a pre-shared key.
336.07s - 339.07s |  So basically the reader and the card or the fob or whatever
339.07s - 343.07s |  and the badge need to have an agreed-upon key
343.07s - 346.07s |  that the manufacturer puts on there.
346.07s - 348.07s |  And there's a challenge and response
348.07s - 351.07s |  between the reader and the fob.
351.07s - 355.07s |  And once they have both proven
355.07s - 358.07s |  that they both know what the key is
358.07s - 360.07s |  without ever saying the key,
360.07s - 363.07s |  then they can just use that key to communicate encrypted.
363.07s - 367.07s |  But this communication is obviously a little bit more complicated
367.07s - 370.07s |  than just the raw, okay, I'm loading the field.
370.07s - 373.07s |  I'm not loading the field communication that we saw earlier.
373.07s - 378.07s |  And because of that and other bandwidth limitations,
378.07s - 381.07s |  this is usually seen in high frequency,
381.07s - 384.07s |  so 13.56 MHz RFID.
384.07s - 390.07s |  So this, at least in principle, seems pretty perfect, right?
390.07s - 393.07s |  This seems like a mathematically secure system
393.07s - 395.07s |  and as long as it's properly implemented
395.07s - 398.07s |  and as long as no one does this inconceivable thing
398.07s - 401.07s |  of just putting the same key everywhere,
401.07s - 403.07s |  you know, like if there was a theoretical,
403.07s - 406.07s |  you know where I'm going, right?
406.07s - 409.07s |  This is what HID did.
409.07s - 415.07s |  They apparently sold and until pretty recently
415.07s - 420.07s |  continued to sell RFID systems
420.07s - 426.07s |  that use the same key on every single standard security
426.07s - 430.80s |  reader and fob that they sold.
430.80s - 433.80s |  The authors of this paper did them a solid
433.80s - 435.80s |  by not releasing the key,
435.80s - 438.80s |  so they had some amount of time to respond,
438.80s - 445.88s |  but obviously did not take that long for the key to appear on GitHub.
445.88s - 453.48s |  But as long as you don't, you know, do stuff like that,
453.48s - 455.48s |  and also there are other vulnerabilities that we've seen
455.48s - 460.48s |  just because of time limitations, we can't go too much into it.
460.48s - 465.48s |  There are, yeah, as long as you implement your security correctly,
465.48s - 467.48s |  as long as you pick your random numbers actually,
467.48s - 470.48s |  you know, in a decently random way,
470.48s - 474.48s |  you can do high security, high frequency RFID
474.48s - 477.48s |  in a vaguely secure way.
477.48s - 480.48s |  What happens if you don't do that
480.48s - 482.48s |  is what Andrew's going to show next.
482.48s - 484.48s |  So yeah, with a demo.
484.48s - 488.02s |  All right. Thank you.
488.02s - 490.02s |  Let's get this set up.
490.02s - 493.02s |  Here is everyone's favorite dolphin.
495.02s - 504.18s |  All right.
504.18s - 507.18s |  So this is the interface for the Flipper Zero,
507.18s - 509.18s |  which is what I'm holding in my hand here.
509.18s - 513.18s |  And it has a lovely little interface here with some animations.
513.18s - 517.18s |  And it's very convenient for copying your hotel room keys
517.18s - 520.18s |  so that you can share them with your friends.
520.18s - 523.18s |  But I'm going to go into low frequency here
523.18s - 525.18s |  because that's what the badges I'm holding are.
525.18s - 528.18s |  And I'm going to read the orange badge.
530.18s - 533.18s |  And we'll see if this is going to work for me.
533.18s - 534.18s |  There we go.
534.18s - 536.18s |  We have the orange badge.
536.18s - 541.18s |  And we are now going to attempt to write this to the blue badge,
541.18s - 543.18s |  which already has information stored on it.
543.18s - 547.18s |  So I'm not 100% sure if this is going to work.
548.18s - 553.40s |  And there we go.
553.40s - 557.40s |  So now our blue badge has the same information as our orange badge
557.40s - 559.40s |  and will open the same doors.
559.40s - 561.40s |  And it can be this simple.
565.40s - 567.40s |  Yeah, just to show that it worked.
567.40s - 569.40s |  Yeah, if we go to read again,
569.40s - 571.40s |  and this time we wrote to the blue badge,
571.40s - 573.40s |  or the blue fob.
573.40s - 576.40s |  So if we read the blue fob, it's going to have the same information.
576.40s - 581.40s |  So when Andrew said it's just saying its ID number,
581.40s - 582.40s |  this is what we mean.
582.40s - 584.40s |  So you see here there's a facility code.
584.40s - 586.40s |  So that's the 25 there.
586.40s - 588.40s |  And a card number.
588.40s - 591.40s |  So in this case it's 15686, right?
591.40s - 594.40s |  So this is just one of our...
597.40s - 600.40s |  You don't have to write that down and try to figure out where I live.
601.40s - 605.40s |  That's one of the test doors that we have at the village.
605.40s - 608.40s |  If you want to come by and you want to plug that into your flipper,
608.40s - 612.40s |  you're probably going to be able to open one of the two test doors that we have.
612.40s - 614.40s |  So yeah, that's what we mean.
614.40s - 618.40s |  It's literally just a four-byte number.
619.40s - 621.40s |  So something else you can do,
621.40s - 623.40s |  the flippers don't support this on the stock firmware,
623.40s - 626.40s |  but something else that you can do with it is...
628.40s - 631.40s |  Does anyone want to say, just yell it out loud,
631.40s - 634.40s |  is four bytes a very large keyset?
635.40s - 637.40s |  No, it's a tiny keyset.
637.40s - 639.40s |  A keyspace rather.
639.40s - 642.40s |  So yeah, you can also brute force this.
643.40s - 645.40s |  Oh yeah, there we go. Andrew has...
648.40s - 650.40s |  So this is the HIDproc.
650.40s - 653.40s |  So this will run through the entire dictionary for HIDproc's devices.
653.40s - 656.40s |  Another common one is the EM4100.
657.40s - 660.40s |  And again, it's a very short dictionary,
660.40s - 663.40s |  and you can run through this in about 15 to 30 seconds.
664.40s - 667.40s |  Yeah, so the main thing that's limiting us here is...
668.40s - 670.40s |  Again, remember, it's a very passive system,
670.40s - 672.40s |  especially for low frequency.
672.40s - 675.40s |  The reader has to ask us what our ID is,
675.40s - 676.40s |  and then we can reply.
676.40s - 679.40s |  So we're limited by the number of times the reader is willing to ask us,
679.40s - 682.40s |  but that's usually either one or two per second.
682.40s - 686.40s |  So even though that sounds like 0.5 hertz or one hertz,
686.40s - 689.40s |  sounds like a very low speed attack,
689.40s - 691.40s |  or like very limited,
691.40s - 693.40s |  because if you were trying to break a hash,
693.40s - 694.40s |  that would be basically impossible,
694.40s - 696.40s |  but because it's just four bytes,
696.40s - 699.40s |  if you can just leave something on there,
699.40s - 700.40s |  maybe overnight,
701.40s - 704.40s |  like after work hours,
704.40s - 707.40s |  you just go put your device on the reader,
707.40s - 708.40s |  you'll leave for a couple hours,
708.40s - 709.40s |  you come back, you pick it up,
709.40s - 715.40s |  and it'll give you what the correct code is.
715.40s - 720.40s |  So with kind of a conclusion to this is...
722.40s - 725.40s |  When we tap our cards, when we tap our badges,
725.40s - 727.40s |  or when we tap to pay,
727.40s - 728.40s |  it all seems very magical.
728.40s - 733.40s |  It feels like we're not limited by the same things we are
733.40s - 735.40s |  when it comes to keys.
735.40s - 739.40s |  A lot of people talk about how if you take a photo of a key,
739.40s - 740.40s |  you can duplicate it.
740.40s - 744.40s |  If you leave your key, it can be measured, decoded.
744.40s - 747.40s |  And it feels like whenever we're using RFID cards
747.40s - 749.40s |  or key fobs, badges,
749.40s - 753.40s |  they feel like they are somehow magically more secure.
753.40s - 757.40s |  And in some cases, for specific use cases it is,
757.40s - 762.40s |  but it's good to remember that it's not a silver bullet.
762.40s - 765.40s |  We should be treating our RFID cards
765.40s - 769.40s |  the same way we treat keys.
769.40s - 774.40s |  So if we lose a fob,
774.40s - 776.40s |  we should do the exact same things that we would do
776.40s - 777.40s |  if we were to lose a key.
777.40s - 778.40s |  Sorry, were you going to say something?
778.40s - 781.40s |  Yes, I was going to say treat it like any secret.
781.40s - 785.40s |  So like your passwords or your door keys to your house,
785.40s - 787.40s |  it's exactly the same thing.
787.40s - 790.40s |  If you have the secret, you have access.
790.40s - 795.40s |  So there needs to be a good maintenance of your secret.
795.40s - 797.40s |  So if you have a building
797.40s - 799.40s |  and you have employees who are terminated,
799.40s - 802.40s |  you need to deactivate that card.
802.40s - 806.40s |  If you have a building that is using an HID card system,
806.40s - 808.40s |  you need to upgrade that to one
808.40s - 812.40s |  that does a proper job encrypting the secret
812.40s - 814.40s |  when it transmits it.
815.40s - 820.40s |  Wygand and other formats after the reader
820.40s - 824.40s |  transmit the secret unencrypted over the wires
824.40s - 826.40s |  to the central server,
826.40s - 828.40s |  which controls the building access system.
828.40s - 833.40s |  So again, even if it's a proper four-way shake
833.40s - 837.40s |  between the reader and the badge,
837.40s - 839.40s |  someone can tamper with one of the readers
839.40s - 843.40s |  and actually tap the wires and intercept the secret there
843.40s - 849.40s |  and replay it at will to gain access later.
849.40s - 852.40s |  Yeah, so just to sum up what Ender said there,
852.40s - 854.40s |  hook up your darn tamper wires.
854.40s - 859.40s |  If you own a building or if you have a security job
859.40s - 862.40s |  or something like that at a building,
862.40s - 864.40s |  you can just test this, right?
864.40s - 867.40s |  Go up to your FOB reader,
867.40s - 869.40s |  unscrew the thing off the wall,
869.40s - 872.40s |  and if you don't receive a call from your security center,
872.40s - 874.40s |  your tamper wire is not hooked up.
874.40s - 876.40s |  You can work with security companies.
876.40s - 878.40s |  You can just come to talks like this.
878.40s - 880.40s |  You can come to the physical security village,
880.40s - 882.40s |  and we will be more than happy to show you
882.40s - 885.40s |  what those tamper wires do and how they're hooked up.
885.40s - 893.40s |  But yeah, so basically there's more to RFID access control
893.40s - 898.40s |  than what people seem to see on an initial look.
898.40s - 901.40s |  So that's kind of why we do this talk.
901.40s - 903.40s |  Also, it's fun to play around with.
903.40s - 905.40s |  All right, with that being said...
905.40s - 907.40s |  There we go, yeah.
907.40s - 911.40s |  If anyone has any questions, please ask us now,
911.40s - 914.40s |  or you can find us at the village afterwards.
914.40s - 917.40s |  Oh, also, we didn't talk much about the Proxmark,
917.40s - 919.40s |  but if you are interested in getting a Proxmark,
919.40s - 920.40s |  you can buy it from Dangerous Things.
920.40s - 923.40s |  Not affiliated, not sponsored, anything like that.
923.40s - 924.40s |  Also...
924.40s - 926.40s |  Oh, yeah, Hacker Warehouse here has them.
926.40s - 929.40s |  Again, not affiliated, not sponsored.
930.40s - 934.40s |  And you can go to proxmarkbuilds.org
934.40s - 939.40s |  to get the good firmware written by Iceman,
939.40s - 941.40s |  and he also has a channel on YouTube
941.40s - 944.40s |  if you want to learn more about how to play around with RFID,
944.40s - 945.40s |  not just using the flipper,
945.40s - 950.94s |  but using more research-oriented tools.
950.94s - 952.94s |  Oh, also, yeah, we sell those, sorry.
952.94s - 954.94s |  Yes, I just want to plug our store.
954.94s - 956.94s |  We're selling the tags, both high frequency and low frequency.
956.94s - 960.94s |  If you need a spare hotel room key, that's where you go.
960.94s - 964.94s |  Yeah, for the high frequency ones, yeah.
964.94s - 969.70s |  Yeah, any questions?
969.70s - 970.70s |  Do we have a...
970.70s - 972.70s |  Okay, I don't think we have a speaker...
972.70s - 974.70s |  Sorry, a microphone for the audience,
974.70s - 976.70s |  so you got to yell it out.
976.70s - 993.95s |  Yeah, so the question was,
993.95s - 1002.95s |  how easy it is to bypass tamper protections on the readers?
1002.95s - 1008.95s |  And it usually depends on the manufacturing of the actual reader.
1008.95s - 1021.95s |  So we did trash their standard security RFID protocol earlier,
1021.95s - 1025.95s |  but HID actually does a pretty decent job at building their readers,
1025.95s - 1030.95s |  and it's kind of really difficult to get a tool in there
1030.95s - 1033.95s |  to keep that tamper sensor from triggering,
1033.95s - 1036.95s |  but it really depends on the reader.
1036.95s - 1039.95s |  I would just play around with it, honestly.
1039.95s - 1040.95s |  Another question?
1040.95s - 1055.72s |  So the question was,
1055.72s - 1060.72s |  so we said that if I have a long-range RFID reader,
1060.72s - 1065.72s |  how does Blue Team defense against that?
1065.72s - 1067.72s |  Two general ways.
1067.72s - 1069.72s |  One is if you have...
1069.72s - 1078.16s |  They make RFID-blocking badge holders.
1078.16s - 1082.16s |  Also, yeah, there are RFID-blocking,
1082.16s - 1085.16s |  you know, like, wallet stuff that you can use.
1085.16s - 1087.16s |  So yeah, this is an example.
1087.16s - 1090.16s |  Not sponsored, just a random manufacturer.
1090.16s - 1091.16s |  Yeah, Amazon.
1091.16s - 1093.16s |  Yeah, from Amazon, apparently.
1093.16s - 1096.16s |  Honestly, any conductive block of thing will do.
1096.16s - 1098.16s |  It'll drain that energy.
1099.16s - 1104.16s |  Or ideally, in conjunction with that,
1104.16s - 1109.16s |  you can use systems that are not vulnerable to just being read by any random.
1109.16s - 1114.16s |  So, for example, a lot of high-frequency protocols
1114.16s - 1119.16s |  will require that handshake before any data is communicated.
1119.16s - 1123.16s |  So if the reader doesn't know the key, then you can't talk to each other.
1123.16s - 1125.16s |  Any other questions?
1125.16s - 1138.10s |  So, for example, if I were to tamper with it in my building,
1138.10s - 1140.10s |  and I don't gain access,
1140.10s - 1145.10s |  is there an alarm and or notification associated?
1145.10s - 1150.10s |  So the question was, if the tamper wire is hooked up,
1150.10s - 1153.10s |  you know, if the tamper system is set up correctly,
1153.10s - 1155.10s |  what happens if someone tampers with the reader?
1155.10s - 1156.10s |  Is that... Yeah.
1156.10s - 1160.10s |  So, honestly, it depends on the system.
1160.10s - 1162.10s |  If you set it up so that you get a special notification,
1162.10s - 1167.10s |  say, because it's, you know, if someone just holds the door open
1167.10s - 1170.10s |  or forces a door open or something like that,
1170.10s - 1171.10s |  you're facing...
1171.10s - 1174.10s |  Obviously, if someone is actually tampering with the device,
1174.10s - 1177.10s |  you're facing a more high-skill attacker.
1177.10s - 1182.10s |  So you might want to, you know, like, work with your alarm company
1182.10s - 1184.10s |  and make sure that you get a special notification
1184.10s - 1186.10s |  or a special alarm condition for that.
1186.10s - 1188.10s |  But it just depends on the system.
1188.10s - 1189.10s |  Do you want to add to that?
1189.10s - 1192.10s |  I just want to add to that.
1192.10s - 1195.10s |  You know, if the alarm system is correctly installed,
1195.10s - 1197.10s |  yes, you will get an alarm.
1197.10s - 1199.10s |  However, alarm fatigue is a thing,
1199.10s - 1203.10s |  and if you tamper with it and then set it off and leave
1203.10s - 1205.10s |  and they come around and look at it,
1205.10s - 1207.10s |  and then you come and mess with it some more and leave
1207.10s - 1208.10s |  and they come and look at it,
1208.10s - 1211.10s |  and then you leave and come back,
1211.10s - 1213.10s |  they are going to stop checking
1213.10s - 1215.10s |  and going to turn off that alarm
1215.10s - 1218.10s |  and you are then free to do your thing
1218.10s - 1220.10s |  and, you know, red team it up.
1220.10s - 1223.10s |  So just wanted to add that.
1223.10s - 1225.10s |  Yeah, I've, for obvious reasons,
1225.10s - 1226.10s |  not going to go too much into details,
1226.10s - 1228.10s |  but I have used an actual engagement
1228.10s - 1232.10s |  where I would just show up, prop a door open, leave,
1232.10s - 1234.10s |  show back up, prop a door open, leave again,
1234.10s - 1239.10s |  and then eventually security stopped responding.
1239.10s - 1242.10s |  Oh, okay, yeah, I think that's our time.
1242.10s - 1243.10s |  Yeah, okay, all right.
1243.10s - 1244.10s |  Thank you so much for coming.
1244.10s - 1245.10s |  If you have any other questions,
1245.10s - 1247.10s |  please do shout to us by email
1247.10s - 1251.10s |  or swing by the village to try out some of these
1251.10s - 1254.10s |  and also some more physical hands-on stuff.
1254.10s - 1255.10s |  Thanks.
