**Introduction to MoWireless MoProblems**

- Presentation by Jeff Horvath and Winston Tam
- Modular wireless survey system and data analytics
- Development of **PacketGlass**, an Elastic-based analytic platform
- Goal: Collect and visualize terabytes of wireless data

**Presenters' Backgrounds**

- **Jeff Horvath**:
  - 13 years in the Army as an intelligence officer
  - Founded **Alsatian Consulting**, focusing on cybersecurity and data protection
  - BA in Political Science and Master's in Information Security Engineering
  - Enthusiast in wireless technology
- **Winston Tam**:
  - 8 years in the Navy as a network engineer, pen tester, and red teamer
  - Founded **Uplinks LLC**, specializes in software development
  - Interests in DIY tinkering and 3D printing

**Project Motivation and Challenges**

- Desire to collect comprehensive wireless data: all channels and packets
- Initial challenges with form factor and power requirements
- Issues with data volume choking analytic tools

**Modular Wireless Collection System**

- **Signal Processing and Reconnaissance Kit Yellow**:
  - Modular system using Raspberry Pi and Android phones
  - Capable of collecting data across various wireless frequencies
  - Includes 13 alpha NEH cards, media tech alpha cards, and one Wi-Fi 6 card
  - Designed for scalability and robustness

**Data Analytics and Visualization**

- Use of **Elk** (Elastic Search, Logstash, Kibana) platform for data analytics
- Objective: Translate raw data into visual formats like dots on maps
- Importance of **normalizing data fields** and **tagging** for efficient retrieval
- Challenges with existing Elastic solutions and development of custom tools

**Implementation and Technical Approach**

- **Pre-processing** with Python scripts for file conversion and normalization
- Stand up a copy of **Elk** using **Docker** for containerization
- Use of **Map Tyler** and **Open Street Maps** for mapping solutions

**Key Takeaways and Acknowledgments**

- Modular approach reduces bottlenecks and enhances system scalability
- Special thanks to contributors and supporters like the Packet Hacking Village Committee, Elk Ninja, and others for their assistance and resources.
