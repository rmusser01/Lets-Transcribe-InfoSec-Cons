**Introduction**
- **Bryson Bort**: Founder of Scythe, Grimm, and co-founder of ICS Village
- **Tom VanNorman**: Co-founder of ICS Village and Senior VP at Grimm

**Industrial Control Systems (ICS)**
- ICS deals with **health, life, and safety**, unlike IT where issues may result in a "quiet day"
- ICS focuses on **resilience and availability** rather than confidentiality, integrity, and availability
- ICS are **older and simpler** than IT systems, with a **physical effect** on the world
- ICS consist of **subsystems that output something**, e.g., a water plant or power grid

**Purdue Model**
- A **nominal enterprise architecture** with **five levels**: IT, DMZ, Engineering Workstations, Programmable Logic Controllers, and specific control zones
- There is **no air gap** between IT and OT, despite what some "nerds" may claim
- The purpose of the Purdue Model is to understand **segmentation** and design **control zones and conduits** to prevent issues in one zone from impacting others

**Threats to ICS**
- Common access vectors are through **IT systems**, which are often the "big squishy thing on the internet"
- Threats leverage **living off the land** tactics, taking over high-level ICS and leveraging their control over other systems
- Cyber weapons like **Indestroyer** are not the primary concern

**Learning and Training**
- ICS Village provides a **hands-on demo** and volunteers can help with understanding ICS
- It is difficult to source and set up ICS equipment from **eBay** due to licensing, keys, and cables
- Focus on **authentication, segmentation, and asset detection** to improve ICS security
- **Patching** in ICS is challenging due to the need for licenses, keys, and specific cables
- **Labs** are essential for learning and testing patches before deploying to production
- **Volunteering** for ICS Village or working with **universities** and **learning institutions** can provide access to ICS equipment and knowledge
