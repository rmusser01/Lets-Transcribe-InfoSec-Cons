  "description": "Delve into the clandestine world of the LockBit ransomware gang! In this revealing presentation, I will recount my two-year journey spent infiltrating the inner ranks of the LockBit crime syndicate. Learn about the strategies employed to earn the trust of key individuals within the syndicate, including the gang's leader, LockBitSupp.\n\nYou will see firsthand accounts of these exchanges, and I will detail the intricacies of my relationship with LockBit's leadership and its network of affiliate hackers. You will also gain insight into the unintended consequences of my actions, including how my perceived breach of their infrastructure impacted the syndicate's operations. More importantly, I will share how I assisted in unmasking the real-world person behind the mask of LockBitSupp.\n\nJoin me as I illustrate the pivotal role of human intelligence in tandem with cyber threat intelligence to combat ransomware threats. This talk offers a compelling narrative of real-world efforts to thwart ransomware activities and safeguard organizations from LockBit ransomware attacks.\n\n60 min (full episode): 4/14/2024: Scattered Spider; Knife; Tasmanian Tiger - CBS News\n60 Min Overtime (additional footage from my interview about LockBit): Infiltrating ransomware gangs on the dark web - CBS News\nRansomware Diaries\nRansomware Diaries: Volume 1 | Analyst1\nRansomware Diaries V. 2: A Ransomware Hacker Origin Story (analyst1.com)\nRansomware Diaries V. 3: LockBit's Secrets (analyst1.com)\nRansomware Diaries Volume 5: Unmasking LockBit (analyst1.com)",

 All right.
2.26s - 4.40s |  OSI model troubleshooting.
4.40s - 7.40s |  It's always physical layer.
7.40s - 9.56s |  So I wasn't planning on giving an intro,
9.56s - 10.74s |  but I'm going to do that.
10.74s - 15.40s |  It's an honor to intro my friend John DiMaggio with AnalystOne.
15.40s - 17.80s |  Most of you probably are here because you've
17.80s - 19.84s |  read some of the work he has done,
19.84s - 22.72s |  either his book, The Art of Cyberwarfare,
22.72s - 25.36s |  or the Ransomware Diaries series that's
25.36s - 28.32s |  pretty popular that sort of culminated in this talk.
28.32s - 30.12s |  This is his first DEF CON talk.
30.12s - 31.92s |  It's way overdue.
31.92s - 34.80s |  He's one of the top cyber espionage practitioners
34.80s - 36.00s |  on the planet.
36.00s - 38.22s |  And with that, I'll turn it over to John.
38.22s - 38.92s |  Here you go, man.
38.92s - 39.42s |  Thanks, man.
39.42s - 40.40s |  Appreciate you, brother.
44.82s - 45.86s |  Thank you.
45.86s - 47.62s |  Where there's a will, there's a way.
47.62s - 48.86s |  I'm glad we got this started.
48.86s - 50.62s |  Let me get this mic adjusted.
50.62s - 51.22s |  All right.
51.22s - 52.90s |  Everybody hear me?
52.90s - 53.78s |  All right.
53.78s - 55.14s |  Well, hear what he said in my name.
55.14s - 56.06s |  Yep, I'm an author.
56.06s - 56.94s |  That's all great.
56.94s - 58.90s |  I'm not here to talk to you about that today.
58.90s - 60.74s |  I do write the Ransomware Diaries.
60.74s - 62.98s |  That is not what this is about, but the output
62.98s - 65.18s |  of what I'm going to talk to you about today is there.
65.18s - 68.18s |  But this is a story.
68.18s - 71.14s |  I am a storyteller, and this is like a once-in-a-lifetime
71.14s - 73.78s |  story, and I'm just so excited to be able to be up here
73.78s - 77.46s |  and tell you this story today.
77.46s - 80.34s |  This is a ransomware story, but it's also
80.34s - 83.02s |  a story of friendship, it's a story of love,
83.02s - 88.18s |  it's a story of betrayal, and it's a story of deceit.
88.18s - 89.74s |  I'm going to be honest with you guys.
89.74s - 93.58s |  When I started to create the content for this,
93.58s - 97.18s |  I found that there was a particular similarity
97.18s - 99.94s |  between my relationship with LockBit,
99.94s - 104.90s |  the man behind LockBit, and the horrific dating love story
104.90s - 107.66s |  shows that my girlfriend tortures me with.
107.66s - 109.54s |  So I'm going to share some of that
109.54s - 111.30s |  and add that element into this today.
111.30s - 115.86s |  So anyway, on that note, let's kick this shit off.
115.86s - 119.46s |  So when I began this, I knew that if I
119.46s - 122.10s |  was going to get LockBit to like me,
122.10s - 124.86s |  I was going to have to talk to him as someone besides myself.
124.86s - 126.70s |  LockBit was sort of the prom queen.
126.70s - 130.30s |  Everybody talking about wanted LockBit to like them,
130.30s - 133.58s |  and he's sort of the top dog.
133.58s - 136.08s |  This was two years ago, though, so it wasn't the number one
136.08s - 138.38s |  ransomware group at the time, but he was moving up.
138.38s - 140.38s |  I knew he wasn't going to talk to me as me,
140.38s - 142.70s |  so I put on a puppet show.
142.70s - 146.94s |  Spent a lot of time developing sock puppets.
146.94s - 150.70s |  I cultivated these puppets, but still, at the same time,
150.70s - 153.42s |  I could only use them if they were believable
153.42s - 156.58s |  and if other people around him believed it.
156.58s - 158.30s |  So the first thing that I had to do
158.30s - 160.34s |  was I needed to hang out at his spots.
160.34s - 162.70s |  What I mean, his favorite spots, what I mean by this,
162.70s - 164.66s |  though, is the places online where
164.66s - 166.94s |  he would go to recruit, the places online where
166.94s - 169.14s |  he would go to socialize, the places where
169.14s - 172.14s |  he'd go to talk with other criminals and other hackers.
172.14s - 173.46s |  This isn't his infrastructure.
173.46s - 175.46s |  These are the places where he spends his time.
175.46s - 178.62s |  So once I found those, I needed to find his accounts.
178.62s - 179.82s |  That was pretty easy.
179.82s - 182.90s |  This dude calls himself LockBit or variations of LockBit
182.90s - 186.18s |  in all of his accounts, so it didn't take too much work.
186.18s - 187.70s |  And once I'd sort of profiled that
187.70s - 190.58s |  and gotten into these various forums that he was on,
190.58s - 192.50s |  I stalked his business partners.
192.50s - 195.30s |  Now, what I mean by that is I looked at the people
195.30s - 197.30s |  he was buying attack resources from,
197.30s - 200.14s |  but I also looked at the conversations
200.14s - 201.26s |  that he was having.
201.30s - 204.10s |  I was looking at the affiliates he was talking to,
204.10s - 206.38s |  but this dude talked to a lot of people.
206.38s - 210.18s |  He is an extreme extrovert when it comes to these forums,
210.18s - 211.94s |  and there was a lot of conversations.
211.94s - 214.02s |  So I needed to figure out who was relevant.
214.02s - 216.94s |  I needed to find those high-value targets.
216.94s - 218.70s |  So I started to look for the people
218.70s - 220.94s |  that he talked to the most, and I started to look
220.94s - 223.90s |  for affiliates that had relationships with not just him,
223.90s - 226.26s |  but with other ransomware groups,
226.26s - 228.46s |  and sort of vetted that list.
228.46s - 232.02s |  Once I had that list and I knew who they were,
232.02s - 235.70s |  that allowed me to spy on them.
235.70s - 238.42s |  So I spent a lot of time going through these forums,
238.42s - 241.30s |  and I mean, I stalked the shit out of these dudes.
241.30s - 243.54s |  I read everything they ever wrote.
243.54s - 246.86s |  Now, taking that information, what I had to do
246.86s - 250.06s |  was sort of overlay that going backwards in time
250.06s - 252.94s |  to see what attacks were taking place in the world
252.94s - 255.66s |  and what significant events were happening.
255.66s - 257.54s |  But that wasn't the important thing.
257.58s - 259.78s |  The important thing was the conversations
259.78s - 261.78s |  that had nothing to do with that.
261.78s - 262.62s |  Think about it.
262.62s - 263.82s |  If you wanna date somebody,
263.82s - 265.50s |  you wanna know their personality,
265.50s - 267.46s |  you gotta know the things that make them tick.
267.46s - 269.26s |  You gotta know the things they find funny.
269.26s - 272.38s |  You gotta know the music they like, their politics,
272.38s - 274.62s |  whatever it might be, if they're religious.
274.62s - 277.34s |  So I really focused on those aspects
277.34s - 279.86s |  of his conversations with other people,
279.86s - 284.14s |  sort of profiled him before I ever engaged or talked to him.
284.14s - 285.78s |  And this helped me a lot by going
285.78s - 287.74s |  and looking through all these resources
287.74s - 290.62s |  and identifying these conversations.
290.62s - 292.54s |  I mean, the attack elements are what everybody read
292.54s - 295.34s |  in the ransomware diaries, but this part,
295.34s - 297.14s |  the stuff that wasn't anything about that
297.14s - 300.70s |  was really the resource that helped me
300.70s - 302.22s |  to get to that end result.
303.54s - 306.98s |  So after that, I stole all of his friends.
306.98s - 310.34s |  So what I mean by that is he talked to a lot of people,
310.34s - 312.34s |  but those people that he had those conversations
312.34s - 313.18s |  that I just mentioned,
313.18s - 315.14s |  those non-work-related conversations,
315.14s - 317.10s |  people he talked to a lot,
317.10s - 318.22s |  those are the people that I wanted
318.22s - 319.90s |  to spend my time talking to.
319.90s - 321.02s |  So I did.
321.02s - 323.90s |  This is Matt Veve, or as I used to know him, Boris,
323.90s - 326.90s |  and as most of you guys know him, Wazowaka.
326.90s - 329.50s |  This was him getting married last year.
329.50s - 332.26s |  This is one of his laptops that he uses to commit crimes.
332.26s - 334.74s |  I guess it's kind of cool to have your name written on that.
334.74s - 336.46s |  He's got me, some other researchers,
336.46s - 338.56s |  and some other criminals written on there.
339.74s - 341.46s |  He's an interesting guy.
343.14s - 344.64s |  Putting a researcher's name on an attack
345.04s - 346.48s |  that you do crimes on, I mean, I don't know,
346.48s - 348.64s |  that's just, what do you say to that?
348.64s - 349.48s |  Thank you?
350.88s - 353.52s |  But getting to become friends with these guys
353.52s - 358.20s |  was important because as I was going to approach LockBit,
358.20s - 360.84s |  I needed to have sort of that validation
360.84s - 363.68s |  from the people who were important to him.
363.68s - 365.96s |  This is Buster, again, most of one knows him
365.96s - 369.16s |  as Basterlord, wrote The Ransomware Diaries
369.16s - 370.84s |  volume two about him.
370.84s - 372.96s |  He'll be upset that I posted this picture.
372.96s - 375.92s |  He got indicted, kind of all knew who he was now,
376.76s - 379.76s |  but he says it's not him, of course it's not.
379.76s - 382.04s |  The funny thing about this picture is, as you see,
382.04s - 384.08s |  I asked him to sign The Ransomware Diaries,
384.08s - 386.56s |  so he did, he signed it APT.
386.56s - 389.08s |  What's so ironic about this is the very first time
389.08s - 392.48s |  I ever talked to him was through Talks,
392.48s - 394.24s |  cryptic communication app, and I said,
394.24s - 396.48s |  hey, Basterlord, how's it going, man, let's talk,
396.48s - 399.04s |  and he said to me, call me Ivan.
399.04s - 401.08s |  Fast forward two years, he's indicted,
401.08s - 402.88s |  this motherfucker's real name's Ivan.
402.88s - 407.88s |  Can't make that shit up, can't make that up.
408.72s - 409.72s |  But yeah, we became friends.
409.72s - 412.04s |  I still like the guy, I mean, you know,
412.04s - 413.72s |  I spend more time talking to criminals
413.72s - 416.72s |  than I do corporate people, maybe that's something about me,
416.72s - 419.40s |  but I enjoy talking to hackers, criminals,
419.40s - 421.78s |  I mean, that's kind of like the culture that I love,
421.78s - 424.82s |  so this dude, you know, I do consider him to be a friend,
424.82s - 427.08s |  wish he chose a different life, but you know,
427.08s - 430.00s |  interesting guy, and then Mr. B brought,
430.00s - 431.80s |  well, lots of people probably hate this guy,
431.80s - 434.40s |  but he's always been respectful to me.
434.40s - 438.72s |  Sometimes he likes to be really sarcastic, poke fun,
438.72s - 440.72s |  but again, this is somebody who's close to LockBit
440.72s - 443.32s |  and spends a lot of time being close to LockBit,
443.32s - 446.20s |  so you know, I wanted to be friends with him.
446.20s - 450.28s |  I had a conversation, me, Azeem from Cisco Talos,
450.28s - 453.70s |  we were joking around with Brava and Wazowaka,
453.70s - 455.92s |  and just to give you an idea of the things
455.92s - 458.28s |  that we talked about, you know, they're not always a source.
458.28s - 459.68s |  Some of the dumb things we talked about
460.36s - 461.88s |  were so silly and fictitious, we were talking about
461.88s - 463.40s |  getting on a boat between, you know,
463.40s - 465.76s |  on international waters between Russia and Poland,
465.76s - 467.96s |  and I was gonna bring a copy of my book,
467.96s - 470.64s |  and Azeem was gonna bring some vodka,
470.64s - 473.40s |  and Wazowaka was gonna cook some food for us,
473.40s - 474.64s |  and we were gonna hang out, I mean,
474.64s - 476.24s |  dumbass conversations just like you'd have
476.24s - 477.16s |  with your regular friends,
477.16s - 479.12s |  but these guys are regular people too,
479.12s - 481.60s |  so when I say, like, I wanna get close to their friends,
481.60s - 483.40s |  that doesn't mean they're like sources
483.40s - 484.98s |  or they're betraying anybody,
484.98s - 488.20s |  it literally means you just became friends with them.
488.20s - 489.88s |  Again, but important to the bigger picture
489.88s - 491.98s |  of my real target, who was LockBit.
492.94s - 495.36s |  Okay, so after I did that, I needed to check out their place,
495.36s - 497.12s |  this is DataLeak's site, obviously,
497.12s - 498.64s |  it's where victims are posted,
498.64s - 500.64s |  but the important thing for this operation
500.64s - 502.12s |  was the affiliate rules,
502.12s - 504.16s |  and the reason that was important to me
504.16s - 508.04s |  was because I wanted to join their gang,
508.04s - 509.88s |  and I tried to do just that.
509.88s - 512.18s |  Now, I knew I wasn't gonna make it all the way through,
512.18s - 515.24s |  because, well, I'm not actually a ransomware criminal,
515.52s - 518.84s |  but I wanted to see what I could learn,
518.84s - 520.40s |  and I figured, fuck it, why not?
520.40s - 522.20s |  It sounded like fun at the time.
522.20s - 524.20s |  So I went through the process,
524.20s - 525.84s |  talked to LockBit on Talks,
525.84s - 527.76s |  he asked me a bunch of technical questions,
527.76s - 529.92s |  now this was my puppet, to be clear,
529.92s - 531.88s |  asked me a bunch of technical questions,
531.88s - 533.88s |  wanted to know who I knew,
533.88s - 536.28s |  what ransomware groups I was affiliated with,
536.28s - 539.24s |  and I had a puppet, I had hijacked another account,
539.24s - 541.92s |  I had somebody that people would vouch for,
541.92s - 543.64s |  but I hadn't committed enough crimes
543.96s - 545.92s |  for his ransomware operations,
545.92s - 548.84s |  so didn't get in, again, knew that,
548.84s - 551.40s |  but something unexpected happened.
551.40s - 554.00s |  You know, with Talks, you have to sort of approve the access
554.00s - 555.80s |  in order to be able to have those conversations
555.80s - 557.00s |  and be in that channel.
558.20s - 560.76s |  After he did not let me into the group,
560.76s - 561.68s |  he kept that open,
561.68s - 564.92s |  he kept that line of communication open.
564.92s - 567.82s |  So what I quickly realized was, this is great,
567.82s - 569.36s |  I can talk to this dude every day now,
569.36s - 571.90s |  if he'll respond to me,
571.90s - 575.82s |  so I did that, and I tried to have conversations with him,
575.82s - 578.30s |  and I acted like I was an upcoming hacker
578.30s - 580.54s |  who looked at him like a mentor
580.54s - 583.94s |  and was asking questions to get better at what I did
583.94s - 586.18s |  and pretended that I was trying to join these other groups
586.18s - 588.06s |  and what he thought and how I should approach them
588.06s - 589.06s |  and things like that,
589.06s - 592.70s |  and he was really receptive to that sort of treatment
592.70s - 594.70s |  of him being this idol in me looking,
594.70s - 596.66s |  or my puppet looking up to him,
596.66s - 597.98s |  and that was pretty effective,
597.98s - 599.98s |  and that's where I got a lot of the intel
600.18s - 603.38s |  that you see in the first volume of the Ransomware Diaries,
603.38s - 606.30s |  but once I got through all of this,
606.30s - 609.70s |  the best part was because LockBit was still talking to me,
609.70s - 611.66s |  he let me play with his toys,
611.66s - 613.40s |  and that was pretty fucking awesome
613.40s - 617.38s |  because LockBit 3.0 did not exist at the time,
617.38s - 620.46s |  he shared some of these pictures with me,
620.46s - 622.94s |  he shared some with VXUnderground and a couple people,
622.94s - 625.72s |  but this was like January, February, 2022,
625.72s - 628.30s |  this didn't come out to be used in attacks
628.30s - 630.50s |  until June of 2022,
630.50s - 631.66s |  so getting to see this,
631.66s - 634.34s |  it allowed me to compare it to the previous panel
634.34s - 637.54s |  and identify what new capabilities we were gonna see.
637.54s - 638.62s |  Now this was significant,
638.62s - 640.36s |  everybody knows how this story ends,
640.36s - 642.64s |  LockBit made a lot of the attacks
642.64s - 645.10s |  that previously required technical expertise
645.10s - 646.62s |  and hands-on keyboard,
646.62s - 648.26s |  he made a lot of those automated.
648.26s - 649.70s |  Seeing that that was coming,
649.70s - 651.78s |  I knew attacks were gonna be quicker,
651.78s - 653.22s |  there was gonna be a higher volume,
653.22s - 656.44s |  and LockBit was gonna move up to the top of the ranks
656.48s - 658.52s |  as far as attack volume,
658.52s - 663.40s |  and that's exactly what happened starting in June of 2022,
663.40s - 665.64s |  but if I hadn't got in there and done all that bullshit
665.64s - 667.80s |  and pretended to be someone else and been friends with him,
667.80s - 669.16s |  I never would have got to see this,
669.16s - 673.16s |  so that was very helpful in this operation.
674.68s - 677.44s |  And then everything has to come to an end,
677.44s - 679.76s |  I wrote up everything that I found,
679.76s - 681.40s |  I exposed him publicly,
681.40s - 683.36s |  and being the smart guy that I am,
683.36s - 685.24s |  I put my name and face on my work,
687.20s - 689.44s |  made for an interesting week, I assure you,
690.64s - 692.28s |  but when you do things like that,
692.28s - 693.96s |  you gotta ask yourself,
693.96s - 695.32s |  are these guys gonna be pissed,
695.32s - 697.52s |  are they gonna be upset?
697.52s - 699.20s |  Either way, I knew those sock puppets
699.20s - 701.84s |  that I spent all that time crafting,
701.84s - 702.80s |  I knew they were burnt,
702.80s - 706.28s |  so this was supposed to be the end of the story,
706.28s - 707.76s |  but it wasn't.
707.76s - 710.60s |  So I asked Azeem from Cisco Talos,
710.60s - 711.72s |  a researcher that I'm friends with,
711.72s - 715.40s |  I asked him to ask LockBit what he thought of my work,
715.40s - 717.08s |  and he did that,
717.08s - 721.44s |  and LockBit says, of course I read it,
721.44s - 723.56s |  I was hoping that there would be a photo
723.56s - 725.40s |  of my yacht, girls, and marijuana.
725.40s - 728.52s |  Now, this is important, this is funny,
728.52s - 730.92s |  the guy that I know is not the guy
730.92s - 733.92s |  that we all see on these forums,
733.92s - 736.92s |  the guy in the forums is like Tony Montana from Scarface,
736.92s - 738.60s |  I think LockBit saw these movies
738.60s - 740.60s |  and just decided he needed to be this badass
740.60s - 742.40s |  and portray himself that way,
742.40s - 745.40s |  because the guy I know, yeah, he loves money,
745.40s - 747.52s |  but he's not flashy.
747.52s - 750.32s |  This is a guy who is more to himself,
750.32s - 753.52s |  more about gardening than yachts.
753.52s - 756.36s |  Okay, so I found it funny
756.36s - 758.56s |  the way he portrayed himself to other people.
758.56s - 760.12s |  And then, of course, he called me Johnny,
760.12s - 761.52s |  which nobody used to call me,
761.52s - 762.80s |  but ever since he started doing it,
762.80s - 764.76s |  it's become the new cool,
764.76s - 766.96s |  it seems that's now what all the criminals like to call me,
766.96s - 769.20s |  so I guess there's worse things to be called.
770.12s - 771.88s |  But knowing what he thought of my work,
771.88s - 774.36s |  which is still kind of a bullshit answer,
774.36s - 776.56s |  I wanted to know what he thought about me.
776.56s - 778.48s |  Well, I didn't have to wait very long.
780.12s - 784.12s |  A few days later, LockBit updated his profile
784.12s - 787.64s |  on one of those forums that I've mentioned that I was on.
787.64s - 790.08s |  Now, you know, he went to my LinkedIn profile,
790.08s - 791.04s |  he took my headshot,
791.04s - 793.64s |  and I remember logging in and seeing this,
793.64s - 797.16s |  and it was, it was a no shit, you know,
797.16s - 799.28s |  asshole fucker moment, I'm not gonna lie.
799.28s - 801.80s |  It was like milliseconds, but it was like in slow motion,
802.56s - 803.88s |  it was like, did I somehow do this?
803.88s - 805.56s |  Like, how is this on here?
805.56s - 808.52s |  And then it clicked, oh my God, this dude's using my face.
809.60s - 812.20s |  I thought it was maybe a threat at first.
812.20s - 813.04s |  It wasn't.
813.04s - 815.60s |  What I've learned about the Russian hacking culture,
815.60s - 817.96s |  it's very different than the US hacking culture.
817.96s - 820.88s |  It kind of reminds me, let me use this analogy,
820.88s - 822.48s |  if you guys have seen like the Godfather movies
822.48s - 824.84s |  back in the day, the Italian mob,
824.84s - 826.12s |  they did bad things to each other,
826.12s - 828.04s |  but there was sort of this respect,
828.04s - 829.48s |  and there were guidelines.
829.48s - 830.48s |  They might kill you,
830.48s - 833.32s |  but they're not gonna kill your kid or your wife.
833.32s - 834.84s |  You know, we got street gangs today,
834.84s - 836.60s |  they'll kill women, children, it doesn't matter,
836.60s - 838.48s |  you piss them off, they're gonna come after you.
838.48s - 840.96s |  Well, the Russian hacking culture is not like that.
840.96s - 843.52s |  There is still a base level of respect
843.52s - 845.52s |  amongst one another in things they do.
845.52s - 849.08s |  LockBit looked at it like, hey, you got me, motherfucker.
849.08s - 850.52s |  Good on ya, respect.
850.52s - 852.88s |  And I can appreciate that.
852.88s - 854.36s |  So that's what this was.
854.36s - 857.92s |  So thankfully, it wasn't a threat like I had first thought.
857.92s - 859.24s |  But it made for an interesting few days.
860.00s - 860.96s |  And he kept this on there
860.96s - 863.48s |  until the account got banned this year.
863.48s - 866.94s |  So it was there for a long time.
866.94s - 869.94s |  So I figured if he likes me or respected my work,
869.94s - 872.22s |  maybe we could still talk, you know?
872.22s - 874.30s |  Maybe we could still hang out.
874.30s - 877.74s |  So I said, hey, man, you know, I just wrote about you.
877.74s - 879.22s |  You know who I am?
879.22s - 880.18s |  Let's talk.
880.18s - 882.78s |  And I still thought he might tell me to fuck off
882.78s - 885.42s |  because direct messages are very different
885.42s - 889.86s |  than how you tell people, perceive people publicly.
889.86s - 891.02s |  But I didn't know what to expect,
891.02s - 892.74s |  but I sure shit didn't expect him to tell me
892.74s - 895.30s |  that he loved me and that I was the best researcher.
896.38s - 897.82s |  That made me laugh.
897.82s - 900.30s |  And, you know, I'm actually not showing stuff like this
900.30s - 901.38s |  to embarrass the dude.
901.38s - 902.46s |  I'm showing this to you guys
902.46s - 905.10s |  because he is a human being just like you and me.
905.10s - 908.58s |  And I legitimately did like a version of him
908.58s - 910.02s |  for a while anyway.
911.22s - 912.10s |  And you can't help that.
912.10s - 913.38s |  You know, you do human engagements.
913.38s - 914.94s |  You can't help how you feel about somebody.
914.94s - 916.34s |  You may not like what they do.
916.34s - 918.38s |  You've got an objective and a mission.
918.38s - 920.94s |  You do that, but you can't help how you feel about it.
920.94s - 922.82s |  But it was cool that the dude liked me back
922.82s - 923.78s |  and seemed to respect me.
923.78s - 925.50s |  I really didn't expect it to go the way,
925.50s - 927.26s |  but this shit made me laugh when I read it.
927.26s - 928.82s |  I was like, what the fuck, man?
930.50s - 933.38s |  So going back to this whole thing
933.38s - 934.94s |  where I really wanted him to like me
934.94s - 939.94s |  and my wooing of LockBit, you know, I asked him questions.
940.34s - 942.38s |  I knew he wasn't gonna tell me a lot,
942.38s - 943.54s |  but I asked him about what he did
943.54s - 944.98s |  before he was in LockBit.
944.98s - 946.94s |  And I'm just showing this part of the conversation
946.98s - 948.34s |  because it's kind of interesting.
948.34s - 949.82s |  You know, he told me that he basically
949.82s - 952.22s |  always wanted to be a cyber criminal.
952.22s - 953.86s |  So he started learning OPSEC
953.86s - 955.78s |  long before he committed crimes.
955.78s - 957.94s |  That way, when he became a criminal,
957.94s - 961.62s |  he didn't have to worry about the FBI arresting him.
961.62s - 963.06s |  Really hasn't worked out that well.
963.06s - 964.86s |  Not arrested, but they clearly
964.86s - 967.26s |  have gotten a lot closer to him.
967.26s - 968.78s |  But I thought this was interesting,
968.78s - 972.14s |  especially now that I know more about him and his past.
973.38s - 975.42s |  So the next thing I needed to do
975.46s - 977.02s |  was I needed to send him gifts.
977.02s - 978.78s |  I mean, if we're gonna go out and date,
978.78s - 981.06s |  you know, I gotta send him some gifts.
981.06s - 983.30s |  And again, this picture,
983.30s - 984.62s |  let me break this down for you guys
984.62s - 986.26s |  because it may not seem like much,
986.26s - 989.94s |  but from an operational standpoint,
989.94s - 991.22s |  this is in my office.
991.22s - 992.54s |  I'm not blurring the background.
992.54s - 993.62s |  I'm showing me.
993.62s - 995.18s |  He knows my book is something
995.18s - 997.38s |  I put a lot of work into that was important.
997.38s - 999.14s |  And this note's handwritten.
999.14s - 999.98s |  I signed it.
999.98s - 1001.62s |  It's got the date.
1001.62s - 1003.34s |  Before I took this picture, I asked him,
1003.34s - 1006.38s |  I said, hey man, I just need your real world name
1006.38s - 1007.66s |  and your home address.
1007.66s - 1009.54s |  I'm gonna send you this awesome gift.
1009.54s - 1011.74s |  And he, I did.
1011.74s - 1014.38s |  And he laughed and, you know, he said to me,
1014.38s - 1015.90s |  yeah, Johnny, I can't do that.
1015.90s - 1018.38s |  If I do that, you're gonna get me arrested.
1018.38s - 1021.42s |  But I'm sharing that because this was very much
1021.42s - 1024.30s |  a cat and mouse chase relationship.
1024.30s - 1027.82s |  And he enjoyed this as much as I did.
1027.82s - 1031.98s |  There's a, I mean, I wrote over 400 pages of content
1032.18s - 1033.98s |  about this dude in the past two years
1033.98s - 1036.74s |  amongst all the Ransomware Diaries volumes.
1036.74s - 1038.62s |  Every time something would come out, he'd get pissed,
1038.62s - 1039.86s |  but he'd always come back
1039.86s - 1042.50s |  because he loved the game as much as I did.
1043.50s - 1045.42s |  And I was obsessed with this motherfucker.
1045.42s - 1046.26s |  I'm not gonna lie.
1046.26s - 1048.34s |  Like, this is where I spent every waking moment
1048.34s - 1049.22s |  was doing this stuff.
1049.22s - 1051.58s |  Like, I really, really was obsessed.
1051.58s - 1052.98s |  But back to this picture.
1052.98s - 1054.62s |  There's the most important part of it
1054.62s - 1056.30s |  that I want you guys to pay attention to
1056.30s - 1060.18s |  is this seductive look in my eyes.
1060.30s - 1064.42s |  That was not an accident, okay?
1064.42s - 1067.38s |  I sent him that picture and he responded,
1067.38s - 1068.70s |  thank you for the photo.
1068.70s - 1070.30s |  You're a very handsome man, right?
1070.30s - 1071.78s |  Yeah, yeah.
1071.78s - 1074.46s |  You look like Bruce Willis and Chuck Norris.
1076.30s - 1078.42s |  I see Chuck, you know, the hair.
1078.42s - 1079.30s |  I don't know about Bruce,
1079.30s - 1081.50s |  but you guys tell me what you think.
1084.82s - 1086.46s |  It was crazy, this was a crazy experience
1086.46s - 1087.30s |  I had with this dude, man.
1087.30s - 1089.26s |  I'll never have a story like this in the rest of my career,
1089.26s - 1091.86s |  but this was what happened.
1091.86s - 1093.50s |  You know, we were cool with each other, we were joking.
1093.50s - 1096.10s |  You know, this wasn't a thing where he's like,
1096.10s - 1097.26s |  oh, you're hot type of thing.
1097.26s - 1098.42s |  I'm making that a joke.
1098.42s - 1100.42s |  But we were just shooting the shit, you know?
1100.42s - 1101.54s |  We were just cool with each other.
1101.54s - 1106.10s |  But all of those things built up to the output
1106.10s - 1107.70s |  of all that information over the years
1107.70s - 1108.98s |  that I've put out on LockBit
1108.98s - 1111.50s |  and nobody's just ever gotten to see this stuff.
1112.74s - 1115.78s |  So after that, we went on our first date.
1115.78s - 1118.10s |  So LockBit and I had the opportunity
1118.10s - 1119.70s |  to go on this show Trafficked
1119.70s - 1122.94s |  and got them to agree to it.
1122.94s - 1126.38s |  And it took about six months to produce this show
1126.38s - 1127.42s |  from where they started
1127.42s - 1129.46s |  to when it was actually put on the air.
1129.46s - 1131.86s |  And that was important because it gave us stuff
1131.86s - 1134.10s |  to talk about and to bond
1134.10s - 1137.14s |  that was not related to their criminal operation.
1137.14s - 1138.66s |  If all I do is ask this dude
1138.66s - 1140.22s |  about stuff with his criminal operation,
1140.22s - 1142.46s |  this would have been a pretty short relationship.
1142.46s - 1145.54s |  And there's only so much content you can have
1145.54s - 1147.02s |  outside of the crimes.
1147.02s - 1149.50s |  So this gave us lots of stuff to talk to.
1149.50s - 1150.58s |  We were both pretty upset.
1150.58s - 1152.78s |  We spent all this time working with these people
1152.78s - 1155.14s |  and we actually got about two minutes on the show.
1155.14s - 1156.94s |  Him too, not just me.
1156.94s - 1158.94s |  Anyway, it gave us something to bitch about.
1158.94s - 1159.98s |  But it was good
1159.98s - 1161.90s |  because we really sort of formed this bond.
1161.90s - 1164.06s |  And our relationship got strong
1164.06s - 1166.02s |  and we were talking so much
1166.02s - 1167.98s |  that I couldn't go on vacation
1167.98s - 1170.10s |  without bringing my second laptop
1170.10s - 1172.34s |  to have conversations with this dude.
1172.34s - 1175.10s |  And I can't be like, hey, it's after 5 p.m. dude
1175.14s - 1178.58s |  or hey, it's a Saturday, I'm off, I'm not gonna talk
1178.58s - 1181.30s |  because this is supposed to be a real relationship.
1181.30s - 1183.10s |  I'm supposed to really be his friend.
1183.10s - 1186.30s |  So again, and when I say this was an obsession,
1186.30s - 1188.30s |  I really mean this was an obsession for me.
1188.30s - 1191.02s |  I really got, I lived for this work.
1191.02s - 1193.82s |  I wanted this dude, I wanted to get this dude.
1193.82s - 1196.02s |  So it took over my life.
1196.02s - 1198.26s |  It took time away from my family.
1198.26s - 1201.50s |  It was not healthy, but it's what I chose to do.
1201.50s - 1204.06s |  And it was very effective,
1204.06s - 1205.70s |  but it was very time consuming.
1205.70s - 1208.62s |  And I needed to take a step back from it.
1208.62s - 1212.26s |  And things started to get awkward between us.
1212.26s - 1214.26s |  And the reason it got awkward is,
1214.26s - 1217.30s |  and it's not so much, this is just one example of many,
1217.30s - 1219.54s |  but LockBit on the forums
1219.54s - 1222.66s |  is extremely confrontational and dramatic.
1223.58s - 1224.86s |  So, and this is just an example.
1224.86s - 1227.10s |  He's talking to Batty, who's one of the leads
1227.10s - 1229.58s |  for what was Royal Ransomware
1229.58s - 1231.46s |  at the time of this conversation.
1231.46s - 1233.42s |  He was trying to get into their panel.
1233.46s - 1235.18s |  He wanted to take their builder.
1235.18s - 1236.38s |  Batty was pissed and was like,
1236.38s - 1239.70s |  why are you trying to get my guys to give you access?
1239.70s - 1242.30s |  LockBit's accusing of being in the FSB.
1242.30s - 1244.02s |  He's always getting into these heated arguments,
1244.02s - 1246.34s |  but he's doing it, at least on this particular forum,
1246.34s - 1247.42s |  with my face.
1247.42s - 1249.10s |  So you've got all these criminals.
1249.10s - 1251.54s |  You've probably got the FSB out there looking at stuff
1251.54s - 1254.18s |  and somebody's gonna ask, who the fuck is this guy?
1256.18s - 1258.50s |  So I needed things to take a step back
1258.50s - 1261.46s |  and I needed to find a way to do that gracefully
1261.46s - 1262.62s |  and with style.
1262.66s - 1265.22s |  So, I started the motherfucker.
1267.22s - 1268.50s |  I actually did this.
1268.50s - 1270.02s |  I knew, he knew me, I knew him.
1270.02s - 1271.58s |  I knew he'd know I was fucking with him
1271.58s - 1273.34s |  or I thought he'd know I was fucking with him.
1273.34s - 1275.06s |  So I made this post.
1275.06s - 1278.02s |  I made myself the bad guy, JohnBit3.0.
1278.02s - 1279.74s |  I made him the victim
1279.74s - 1281.94s |  and I put in there LockBit Ransomware Gang
1281.94s - 1285.22s |  being a pain in my ass since September 3rd, 2019
1285.22s - 1287.38s |  and told him if he didn't pay me $10 million,
1287.38s - 1289.10s |  I was gonna release his secrets.
1289.10s - 1290.78s |  Now, that was just the fucking report.
1290.78s - 1293.22s |  It was the Ransomware Diaries called LockBit Secrets.
1293.22s - 1294.38s |  Yes, there were secrets.
1294.38s - 1297.26s |  They were like stuff he'd lied to his business partners about
1297.26s - 1298.90s |  and problems in his operation
1298.90s - 1300.02s |  that he didn't want people to know
1300.02s - 1302.18s |  but nobody was paying $10 million.
1302.18s - 1303.14s |  It was a joke.
1303.14s - 1305.46s |  But to make sure he took me seriously,
1305.46s - 1307.34s |  I posted this the next day.
1307.34s - 1308.18s |  All right?
1312.26s - 1314.98s |  Now, I went to go talk to him about it
1314.98s - 1318.18s |  to see what he would say when I didn't hear from him
1318.18s - 1319.90s |  but something interesting happened.
1319.90s - 1321.66s |  He went offline.
1321.66s - 1323.06s |  I thought he blocked me.
1323.06s - 1325.06s |  He didn't, nobody could access him
1325.06s - 1326.18s |  and it was both his accounts,
1326.18s - 1329.02s |  his support account and his private account were offline
1329.02s - 1331.30s |  and then I started getting messages from his affiliates
1331.30s - 1332.74s |  and from security researchers too
1332.74s - 1336.22s |  but the important part of that is the affiliates
1336.22s - 1338.58s |  saying, you know, he's been offline.
1338.58s - 1339.74s |  We're beginning to worry.
1339.74s - 1341.78s |  We think he's in prison or dead.
1341.78s - 1343.14s |  Are you part of this?
1344.86s - 1347.14s |  Look guys, that's cool you think I'm like,
1347.14s - 1348.66s |  you know, that effective
1348.66s - 1350.50s |  but I'm not kicking anybody's door in.
1350.50s - 1352.22s |  I'm not jumping out of planes in Russia
1352.22s - 1353.70s |  and pulling you out in the middle of the night.
1353.70s - 1355.78s |  You know, I was just fucking around.
1355.78s - 1356.62s |  It was a post.
1356.62s - 1359.34s |  I couldn't believe that people were believing this.
1359.34s - 1360.66s |  This is another one.
1360.66s - 1361.50s |  Bastard Lord, you know,
1361.50s - 1363.10s |  you actually found a way to de-anonymize
1363.10s - 1364.06s |  everyone from LockBit.
1364.06s - 1367.02s |  Like guys, I wish I was a badass hacker to that level.
1367.02s - 1368.70s |  Like, you know, I can fuck around a little bit
1368.70s - 1370.78s |  but damn, no, no, this was a joke.
1370.78s - 1373.38s |  I wouldn't have used Twitter to do it if it was real.
1375.10s - 1377.46s |  But I found out why.
1377.46s - 1380.34s |  I got this DM with this image
1380.34s - 1382.06s |  and I cut off the top of this
1382.06s - 1383.66s |  because it had the URL.
1383.66s - 1385.82s |  But anyway, it was to the admin page
1385.82s - 1387.86s |  and it said, it was the old URL.
1387.86s - 1390.10s |  But anyway, it said, do we really have to?
1390.10s - 1392.62s |  And it was referencing the authentication
1392.62s - 1394.54s |  part of the page for the panel.
1394.54s - 1395.78s |  So obviously it insinuates, okay,
1395.78s - 1397.94s |  we bypassed it and we got in.
1397.94s - 1399.50s |  Now things were making sense.
1399.50s - 1401.02s |  I threatened the dude.
1401.02s - 1404.30s |  He finds out somebody's really trying to hack him.
1404.34s - 1407.42s |  He starts to believe maybe I actually did
1407.42s - 1409.26s |  and thinks that I'm in his, in his,
1409.26s - 1411.70s |  in his infrastructure fucking around.
1411.70s - 1413.86s |  I found out pretty quickly what happened.
1413.86s - 1415.78s |  Thank you, ProDaft.
1415.78s - 1416.90s |  They actually did an op
1416.90s - 1419.22s |  and apparently they're the ones who hacked him.
1419.22s - 1422.14s |  I was just there, good timing to, to,
1422.14s - 1426.30s |  to make that threat and, and, and fit into that situation.
1426.30s - 1427.78s |  But it made for fun.
1427.78s - 1429.34s |  It made for, that happened last summer
1429.34s - 1432.14s |  and that made for a really fun DEF CON for me, trust me.
1432.18s - 1436.54s |  Uh, so after that, uh, LockBit did come back
1436.54s - 1437.82s |  about two weeks later.
1437.82s - 1440.46s |  Uh, you know, we hugged it out, we were good,
1440.46s - 1443.18s |  but things were off still, all right?
1443.18s - 1445.66s |  This is how I know things were off.
1445.66s - 1448.90s |  I said, sorry, um, told him I'm glad he wasn't dead
1448.90s - 1450.54s |  or anything like that.
1450.54s - 1452.70s |  He didn't send me a cat emoji.
1452.70s - 1455.38s |  He always sent me cat emojis and stickers.
1455.38s - 1457.02s |  This is a very passive aggressive way
1457.02s - 1458.70s |  of him telling me that he's mad at me.
1458.70s - 1462.30s |  Uh, but, and our conversation started to dwindle
1462.30s - 1465.42s |  and, um, it didn't take long.
1465.42s - 1468.30s |  He was having an emotional relationship with someone else.
1468.30s - 1469.78s |  He was.
1469.78s - 1471.98s |  Uh, I drove by his house one night,
1471.98s - 1475.06s |  by his house I mean his, uh, his infrastructure.
1475.06s - 1477.42s |  And this new bitch left their shit all over.
1477.42s - 1480.46s |  The hairbrush was on the kitchen sink, okay?
1480.46s - 1481.92s |  Their hair tie is on the door.
1481.92s - 1484.34s |  They wanted me to know they had been there.
1484.34s - 1488.66s |  Uh, so the NCA had locked down LockBit's infrastructure,
1488.66s - 1491.86s |  um, put their shit up everywhere.
1491.86s - 1494.90s |  So, you know, I was upset and I didn't like that.
1494.90s - 1498.14s |  Uh, but then when, when you go to log into the panel,
1498.14s - 1500.14s |  there's this new message and it's basically saying,
1500.14s - 1504.06s |  hey, uh, we, we've got all of your, your chat logs.
1504.06s - 1507.14s |  We know what victims you're responsible for
1507.14s - 1508.68s |  and we've got your wallets.
1508.68s - 1513.68s |  Now, this is meant for criminals to see and they did.
1513.88s - 1516.52s |  And it was meant to play a psychological role
1516.52s - 1517.80s |  and it certainly did.
1517.80s - 1518.88s |  But you guys got to remember,
1518.88s - 1521.80s |  they're also looking at my conversations.
1521.80s - 1522.64s |  They're looking at all the,
1522.64s - 1524.04s |  all the conversations that I'm having.
1524.04s - 1525.98s |  They're probably seeing my account in there
1525.98s - 1526.82s |  and everything else.
1526.82s - 1528.56s |  So, um, that was a little bit like,
1528.56s - 1530.28s |  oh boy, I might be in some trouble here.
1530.28s - 1533.96s |  Uh, but again, they were fucking with my man.
1533.96s - 1534.84s |  So I was upset.
1535.84s - 1538.06s |  Uh, but LockBit wasn't going to go down, uh,
1538.06s - 1538.90s |  without swinging.
1538.90s - 1540.56s |  I knew he wasn't going to rebrand.
1540.56s - 1543.80s |  He stood a new, his new, uh, infrastructure up,
1543.80s - 1546.56s |  made, made the FBI his first victim.
1546.56s - 1547.68s |  But when you click on it,
1547.68s - 1550.56s |  he's got like this three page long ass letter
1550.56s - 1552.78s |  that nobody wants to fucking read about what happened.
1552.78s - 1554.48s |  Basically saying he got fat and lazy
1554.48s - 1557.92s |  and forgot to upgrade some stuff and they came in
1557.92s - 1559.88s |  and it wouldn't happen again.
1559.88s - 1562.04s |  And that business would continue as usual.
1563.12s - 1566.86s |  Um, but like I said, our relationship was now affected.
1566.86s - 1571.46s |  And like all things, um, you know,
1571.46s - 1572.50s |  they do come to an end.
1572.50s - 1574.02s |  And, and hitting pause on the jokes,
1574.02s - 1575.54s |  like we really did have a relationship
1575.54s - 1577.18s |  and it really did have ups and downs.
1577.18s - 1579.14s |  I, I'm just kind of adding some,
1579.14s - 1581.94s |  some theatrics to it to make it a, a fun talk.
1581.94s - 1584.54s |  But, but we really did have this, this long-term,
1584.54s - 1587.30s |  this was like over two years, this long-term relationship.
1587.30s - 1590.94s |  Um, and I did actually get to like the guy a little bit
1590.94s - 1592.02s |  and then this happened
1592.02s - 1594.82s |  and this got me really, really upset.
1594.86s - 1597.70s |  Uh, so LockBit hit St. Anthony's Hospital
1597.70s - 1599.38s |  and I'm talking to him about it.
1599.38s - 1602.22s |  And I truly believed that I could get him
1602.22s - 1603.74s |  to give them decryption key.
1603.74s - 1606.66s |  And the reason I believe that is because, you know,
1606.66s - 1610.10s |  sick kids, which, uh, it deals with, with kids with cancer,
1610.10s - 1613.34s |  um, he did the right thing and, and gave the key back to them.
1613.34s - 1614.78s |  Well, St. Anthony's Hospital
1614.78s - 1617.30s |  has a large children's cancer ward.
1618.18s - 1620.78s |  So I talked to him about it and I said, look, man, uh,
1620.78s - 1621.62s |  give them back the key.
1621.62s - 1622.78s |  You've still got their data.
1622.78s - 1624.62s |  If you're going to extort them, you're going to extort them.
1624.62s - 1626.94s |  You know, you're greedy, but you're not a monster.
1626.94s - 1627.94s |  Just do the right thing.
1627.94s - 1629.82s |  And he wouldn't do it and kept telling me, you know,
1629.82s - 1632.30s |  when he, he, when I saw the data, I'd understand.
1632.30s - 1633.70s |  Well, unless you're going to show me
1633.70s - 1636.58s |  that they hired a bunch of kids to pretend they had cancer,
1636.58s - 1637.78s |  I'm not going to change my mind.
1637.78s - 1639.34s |  I don't give a shit what they do with their money.
1639.34s - 1641.70s |  Like these are kids suffering.
1641.70s - 1643.86s |  And, uh, I started to realize, you know,
1643.86s - 1645.62s |  I'd gotten too close to this.
1645.62s - 1647.50s |  You know, this guy's a fucking cockroach.
1647.50s - 1649.58s |  Anybody that fucks with kids, like, I mean,
1649.58s - 1651.90s |  I, I guess I got too close cause I, I didn't see it.
1651.90s - 1653.58s |  And I, I naively believed I'd get,
1653.58s - 1655.30s |  I could get him to give the key back.
1655.30s - 1658.42s |  Um, and I couldn't, and I sat there for,
1658.42s - 1660.50s |  I was in my office and I sat there for a good hour
1660.50s - 1662.06s |  and I typed this message up,
1662.06s - 1663.42s |  telling him to go fuck himself,
1663.42s - 1665.18s |  telling him that I was coming for him.
1665.18s - 1667.74s |  Think I even had the fucking taking quotes in there.
1667.74s - 1670.86s |  Uh, but if you do this type of work,
1670.86s - 1672.50s |  there's some rules that you have to play by.
1672.50s - 1674.10s |  And that's that you never let your emotions
1674.10s - 1675.30s |  affect what you do.
1675.30s - 1677.06s |  And the day that I do let that happen
1677.06s - 1678.30s |  is the day that I need to go back
1678.30s - 1682.10s |  to being a CTI straight zeros and ones researcher.
1682.10s - 1684.54s |  Um, so I didn't, I didn't click send on that.
1684.54s - 1688.46s |  Instead, I, I just sent a thumbs up and, and I regrouped.
1688.46s - 1690.42s |  But I was, I, I was legitimately,
1690.42s - 1692.18s |  personally like affected by this.
1692.18s - 1694.46s |  Like it really, really bothered me.
1694.46s - 1697.38s |  And, you know, making things worse.
1697.38s - 1700.06s |  Um, I know I kind of catfished him
1700.06s - 1701.90s |  at the beginning with sock puppets,
1701.90s - 1704.26s |  but you know, Lockwood had told me that,
1704.26s - 1706.26s |  you know, he lived in New York.
1706.26s - 1707.70s |  Sounds legitimate, right?
1707.70s - 1709.86s |  Uh, he told me he owned two restaurants
1709.90s - 1713.06s |  and he told me he drove a Ferrari.
1713.06s - 1717.30s |  And now that me and the other man were talking,
1717.30s - 1720.02s |  uh, apparently he didn't live in the United States.
1720.02s - 1722.18s |  Uh, obviously I knew he lives in Russia.
1722.18s - 1723.42s |  I'm being facetious,
1723.42s - 1725.06s |  but they said he didn't drive a Lamborghini
1725.06s - 1726.38s |  and he drives a Mercedes.
1726.38s - 1727.66s |  Now I was pissed.
1727.66s - 1729.70s |  Do I look like I'm going to fuck around
1729.70s - 1732.06s |  with some dude that's picking me up in a Mercedes?
1732.06s - 1733.02s |  That shit better be,
1733.02s - 1735.30s |  you better be rolling up in at least a quarter mil.
1735.30s - 1736.98s |  I want a Bugatti something.
1736.98s - 1738.26s |  I'm not fucking riding around
1738.26s - 1739.58s |  with some dude in a Mercedes.
1739.58s - 1740.66s |  Get the fuck out of here.
1740.66s - 1742.10s |  That shit's a dime a dozen.
1742.10s - 1743.06s |  So I was upset.
1743.06s - 1744.46s |  I didn't like being lied to.
1744.46s - 1748.22s |  So, now shit was, was gonna, was up.
1748.22s - 1750.58s |  You know, we, he had both me pissed,
1750.58s - 1752.38s |  he had law enforcement pissed,
1752.38s - 1754.22s |  and, and I really did want to get him.
1754.22s - 1755.38s |  Now that he fucked with kids,
1755.38s - 1757.38s |  like, like before I was just fucking around.
1757.38s - 1758.78s |  I wanted to get shit so I could write,
1758.78s - 1760.06s |  you know, interesting stories.
1760.06s - 1762.42s |  As I said, I love telling stories and I love writing.
1762.42s - 1764.42s |  But now I was like, it was, it was personal.
1764.42s - 1766.46s |  Like I wanted to get this guy.
1766.46s - 1768.54s |  Uh, so that shit was on.
1768.58s - 1771.98s |  And I was reaching out to, to all my resources.
1771.98s - 1774.78s |  Now remember, I built a vast network of,
1774.78s - 1776.42s |  of relationships with criminals,
1776.42s - 1779.38s |  with affiliates, and with security researchers.
1779.38s - 1781.42s |  And I mean, I'm calling in favors
1781.42s - 1783.74s |  and I'm, I'm, I'm using myself
1783.74s - 1786.70s |  and I'm using also sock puppets all at the same time.
1786.70s - 1788.38s |  And I'm trying to extract data
1788.38s - 1789.90s |  and, and trying to do everything I can
1789.90s - 1791.74s |  to figure out who this dude is.
1791.74s - 1794.74s |  And LockBin knew what I was doing at this point.
1794.74s - 1796.54s |  He started hearing the rumors, you know,
1796.54s - 1798.70s |  that I was asking all these questions.
1798.70s - 1801.06s |  Um, and I often get tips from people.
1801.06s - 1802.98s |  I'll be honest, before the Ransomware Diaries,
1802.98s - 1804.82s |  there were probably like 10 of you to who I was,
1804.82s - 1807.62s |  uh, unless you were into nation state work.
1807.62s - 1810.54s |  Um, but, but once the Ransomware Diaries kicked off,
1810.54s - 1812.58s |  uh, you know, it was like being the hot new kid,
1812.58s - 1815.02s |  like a hot new, new, new girl at school.
1815.02s - 1816.50s |  Like I was getting a lot of attention.
1816.50s - 1819.14s |  So I get tips a lot, but often they're bullshit.
1819.14s - 1820.78s |  So I wasn't exactly sure,
1820.78s - 1823.90s |  but I got one saying that follow this email address,
1823.94s - 1828.26s |  sitedev5index.ru, and you will find that person
1828.26s - 1831.62s |  is the guy behind the LockBitSup persona.
1831.62s - 1833.18s |  Um, so I started to look into it,
1833.18s - 1835.86s |  but this guy owned two legitimate businesses.
1835.86s - 1838.14s |  He owned a handful of websites.
1838.14s - 1840.42s |  Every one of them were legitimate businesses.
1840.42s - 1843.46s |  So I almost thought this was, was, was,
1843.46s - 1845.42s |  was bullshit and walked away.
1845.42s - 1847.18s |  And then I saw this.
1847.18s - 1849.26s |  Now, most of you have seen this, but you gotta remember,
1849.26s - 1851.42s |  this was before the indictment
1851.42s - 1853.10s |  and all that other shit that's taken place in the,
1853.10s - 1854.10s |  in real world.
1854.10s - 1855.46s |  This was before all of that.
1855.46s - 1858.18s |  So I saw this and I remember that the, uh,
1858.18s - 1860.58s |  the NCA had said, you know, he drove a Mercedes.
1860.58s - 1863.30s |  So when I saw this in combination with that tip,
1863.30s - 1866.10s |  it was just enough to, for me to decide, okay,
1866.10s - 1868.06s |  I need to dig in a little further.
1868.06s - 1869.70s |  I almost walked away right here.
1869.70s - 1871.58s |  And that, again, that would have been the end of the story
1871.58s - 1873.66s |  if I had, um, but I didn't.
1873.66s - 1875.58s |  And it brought me to this guy, uh,
1875.58s - 1878.02s |  Dimitri Horoshevev, if I'm saying that right.
1878.02s - 1880.54s |  Uh, and I found these accounts
1880.54s - 1883.66s |  and they were all related to malicious things.
1883.66s - 1886.34s |  Uh, ransomware, botnets, malware.
1886.34s - 1889.82s |  And one of his accounts was even on the same forum
1889.82s - 1892.62s |  where he now has my, or used to have my picture
1892.62s - 1893.86s |  before he got banned.
1893.86s - 1895.98s |  Um, so there are lots of similarities.
1895.98s - 1898.34s |  Uh, so I, I wasn't sure I had the right guy,
1898.34s - 1899.94s |  but I definitely was interested
1899.94s - 1902.38s |  and was, was continuing to dig on him.
1903.42s - 1906.66s |  So then it was a Sunday and, uh, I got this alert.
1906.66s - 1908.58s |  Most people watch TV.
1908.58s - 1910.02s |  I watch LockBit.
1910.50s - 1912.10s |  Uh, I got this alert to his,
1912.10s - 1914.26s |  that said that the site, the site was up.
1914.26s - 1916.74s |  And remember the site had been taken over by the NCA.
1916.74s - 1918.42s |  He created a new one.
1918.42s - 1920.46s |  And I got this alert saying it was online
1920.46s - 1922.34s |  and I thought it was a false positive.
1922.34s - 1924.98s |  I log in and I see it is online
1924.98s - 1926.70s |  and it's populated with, you know,
1926.70s - 1928.90s |  all this law enforcement propaganda,
1928.90s - 1930.70s |  but I see this who is LockBit sup
1930.70s - 1932.94s |  and it's got a countdown timer.
1932.94s - 1934.18s |  And I go check social media.
1934.18s - 1936.26s |  Like nobody else has said anything about this.
1936.26s - 1937.94s |  And I'm like, can I really be the only person
1937.94s - 1938.86s |  that's seen this?
1938.90s - 1940.14s |  And apparently I was,
1940.14s - 1942.18s |  cause I posted it and people went nuts.
1942.18s - 1945.14s |  Um, but this, this, this was pretty crazy
1945.14s - 1946.54s |  because I'm, now I'm in this position
1946.54s - 1947.62s |  where I'm like, fuck man,
1947.62s - 1949.30s |  I got to put this report together.
1949.30s - 1950.34s |  I might have the right guy.
1950.34s - 1952.18s |  I might not, but if they're going to name him,
1952.18s - 1954.54s |  you know, this is, this is my opportunity.
1954.54s - 1955.94s |  Uh, but I had a problem.
1955.94s - 1957.86s |  I had to get on a plane and fly to RSA.
1957.86s - 1960.98s |  So, um, I couldn't take my research box with me.
1960.98s - 1963.62s |  Um, I remember landing, going to my hotel room
1963.62s - 1965.90s |  and that next 24 hours, I didn't leave.
1965.90s - 1966.74s |  I didn't eat.
1966.74s - 1967.82s |  I didn't order food.
1967.82s - 1970.82s |  I just sat and wrote and I wrote 25 pages of content.
1970.82s - 1972.74s |  Now, remember, I couldn't tell anybody
1972.74s - 1973.94s |  in my company about this.
1973.94s - 1975.70s |  Okay. I didn't, couldn't take the chance
1975.70s - 1978.02s |  that if I had the right guy, it getting leaked.
1978.02s - 1982.38s |  Um, so I wrote it and I sat quietly and I waited.
1982.38s - 1985.78s |  And the next morning, May 7th,
1985.78s - 1987.26s |  they do the identity reveal
1987.26s - 1989.70s |  and it's the same fucking dude.
1989.70s - 1993.54s |  So I was like, there's no way that could be a coincidence.
1993.54s - 1994.86s |  Um, the problem is they didn't release
1994.86s - 1996.34s |  a lot of information about him.
1996.34s - 1997.62s |  You know, there's an email address,
1997.62s - 1999.82s |  some passport numbers and a picture,
1999.82s - 2001.98s |  but there's not a lot of info about him.
2001.98s - 2005.26s |  So I had to wait a little bit
2005.26s - 2007.02s |  cause nobody knew I had to get the web team.
2007.02s - 2008.78s |  I'm like, you gotta get this thing published.
2008.78s - 2010.58s |  Like move, it has to be now.
2010.58s - 2014.66s |  Uh, so an hour later, uh, my first,
2014.66s - 2017.50s |  I helped in doxing the shit out of this motherfucker.
2017.50s - 2018.82s |  I knew where he lived.
2018.82s - 2019.90s |  I had his phone number.
2019.90s - 2022.18s |  You know how hard it was for me to not call this guy?
2022.18s - 2024.30s |  Uh, I had his phone number.
2024.30s - 2025.50s |  I had his email addresses.
2025.50s - 2028.14s |  I even had like the pictures of his apartment building
2028.14s - 2029.58s |  before he rented it out.
2029.58s - 2032.66s |  Um, his door, his pin code from his door,
2032.66s - 2034.18s |  the beautiful multi-ego graph
2034.18s - 2037.54s |  with all this information on him, social media accounts.
2037.54s - 2039.90s |  You know, I knew a lot about his family,
2039.90s - 2041.98s |  though I would never include that in any of this.
2041.98s - 2045.18s |  But my point is, is that, uh, I put all that shit out there
2045.18s - 2047.42s |  and, uh, the one part of the story
2047.42s - 2048.42s |  I didn't share with you guys,
2048.42s - 2050.30s |  I probably wouldn't have done this.
2050.30s - 2053.66s |  The reason that I did this is what I found out
2053.70s - 2055.74s |  when I was really digging into this at the end
2055.74s - 2056.90s |  after the NCA came in,
2056.90s - 2058.70s |  when I was trying to find out who he was,
2058.70s - 2061.18s |  he caught wind of me asking all these questions
2061.18s - 2064.46s |  to the affiliates, um, and some affiliates told me
2064.46s - 2067.54s |  that he was pissed and he was coming after me,
2067.54s - 2069.82s |  um, and that he wanted revenge against me.
2069.82s - 2071.10s |  Um, if that hadn't happened,
2071.10s - 2073.38s |  I probably wouldn't have blown his shit up,
2073.38s - 2075.58s |  but I wanted him to know if he knew where I lived,
2075.58s - 2077.02s |  I knew where he did too.
2077.02s - 2078.26s |  Game on, motherfucker.
2078.26s - 2079.50s |  You know, I wanted to make sure
2079.50s - 2080.94s |  everybody knew where he lived.
2080.94s - 2082.50s |  Uh, he needs to be so busy,
2082.50s - 2084.86s |  he doesn't have time to worry about me, so.
2084.86s - 2088.22s |  Anyway, the perfect ending to the story, however,
2088.22s - 2089.98s |  uh, we couldn't end it here.
2089.98s - 2092.54s |  I needed to say goodbye to him, so I did.
2092.54s - 2095.98s |  I know he reads all my stuff, so I wanted him to know
2095.98s - 2097.82s |  I had too much respect for him
2097.82s - 2099.94s |  to let somebody else do this, and that's true.
2099.94s - 2101.74s |  Uh, all these people that say,
2101.74s - 2104.94s |  oh, well, he has horrible, uh, OSINT practices,
2104.94s - 2106.82s |  uh, it was so easy for- to find him.
2106.82s - 2108.86s |  This guy, you know, it's amateur hour.
2108.86s - 2110.06s |  Okay, these are all people that say that
2110.06s - 2112.34s |  after his name and address and everything else
2112.34s - 2114.98s |  were released, it's really easy to work backwards
2114.98s - 2117.14s |  and be like, oh, yeah, it's easy to figure this guy out.
2117.14s - 2119.06s |  Well, nobody was finding him before
2119.06s - 2121.14s |  they put his name on an indictment.
2121.14s - 2123.78s |  Um, I- I did, but- but what I'm saying
2123.78s - 2125.18s |  is the general public hadn't.
2125.18s - 2127.38s |  So I needed him to know it needed to be me,
2127.38s - 2130.74s |  it was time to go, I needed to say my goodbyes,
2130.74s - 2131.74s |  but before this could end,
2131.74s - 2134.78s |  I had one final thing I needed to do,
2134.78s - 2137.62s |  and that was to come to DEF CON
2137.62s - 2140.90s |  and troll the shit out of that motherfucker.
2140.90s - 2142.66s |  So that's happening today.
2142.66s - 2144.38s |  And this is our memory reel.
2144.38s - 2146.30s |  Dimitri, if you're out there watching this,
2146.30s - 2148.54s |  the kids wanna know when you're coming home, baby.
2148.54s - 2149.38s |  I miss you.
2151.02s - 2152.90s |  These are my two favorite Dimitris, by the way.
2152.90s - 2155.18s |  The- the other guy is Dimitri Smolatos,
2155.18s - 2156.46s |  uh, from Recorded Future.
2156.46s - 2159.18s |  But, uh, this is- this is LockBit, this is me.
2159.18s - 2160.34s |  I've been having fun with this.
2160.34s - 2163.38s |  Uh, I really appreciate you guys being patient with us.
2163.38s - 2165.22s |  Um, if I have time for questions,
2165.22s - 2167.38s |  I don't think that we do, because we started late,
2167.38s - 2169.02s |  you guys tell me, but if- if not,
2169.02s - 2171.22s |  I'll be happy to hang around and answer them.
2171.22s - 2172.06s |  Um, but thank you.
2172.06s - 2173.94s |  This is my first DEF CON talk.
2173.94s - 2174.94s |  It's always been a dream.
2174.94s - 2177.18s |  Thanks for- for being here with me.
2177.18s - 2178.02s |  Thank you.
