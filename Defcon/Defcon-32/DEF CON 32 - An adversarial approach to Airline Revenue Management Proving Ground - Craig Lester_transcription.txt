  "title": "DEF CON 32 - An adversarial approach to Airline Revenue Management Proving Ground - Craig Lester",
  "description": "Richard Branson is oft quoted with the quip that the quickest way to become a millionaire in the Airline Industry is to start as a billionaire. An Industry constrained by high fixed capital costs, bi-lateral capacity treaties, airport slots and curfews, labour etc; Airlines use the practice of revenue management to fill planes, maximise earnings and keep competitors at bay. But you\u2019re not interested in an economics talk \u2013 this is a hacker con. I\u2019m here to provide a birds-eye view and introduction into how fares and ticketing work, debunking some myths while outlining system constraints and limitations that introduce vulnerabilities. As an outcome, attendees should gain an introductory understanding of airline industry pricing, published fares and terminology. With most blogged 'deals' patched quicker than RCEs, the deeper understanding of not what but how, facilitates a progression for those interested to interact on more specialised discussion forums.",

0.14s - 7.84s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Good morning. Ah, there we go. Good morning everyone. I am a Lillian Ashbaker. I represent the aerospace village
7.84s - 15.78s |  I do the speaker CFP process the aerospace village is in conjunction with the creator stage team is pleased to introduce Craig
16.06s - 23.10s |  He is presenting on an adversarial approach to airline revenue management. So please welcome Craig to the stage
30.14s - 32.14s |  Well, hey everyone
37.50s - 39.98s |  I'm Craig a little about me. I
42.38s - 45.54s |  First moved interstate for work about 15 years ago and
46.34s - 48.34s |  started flying a lot since then
48.50s - 53.28s |  by trade, I'm I work with Splunk and Simtools now, but my
54.06s - 57.18s |  Background was Cisco and carrier sort of networking stuff
57.94s - 59.94s |  But yeah
60.02s - 63.86s |  So firstly what what's this talk not about so it's I'm not all about
65.74s - 72.50s |  These big clickbait, you know sort of travel articles where when really when you break them down at the end of the day
72.66s - 75.80s |  It's like sign up for this credit card get a sign on bonus
76.90s - 80.86s |  and you know pick the most expensive fare out there to
81.98s - 83.82s |  To advertise it through
83.82s - 85.82s |  So with that just a little disclaimer
86.82s - 89.74s |  That already intended audience, so
96.61s - 99.41s |  Okay, it's just a little disclaimer I guess
99.93s - 103.25s |  The intended audience for this talk is supposed to be I guess people that
103.77s - 106.77s |  Airlines or whatever so they can defend their systems better, right? It's ethically
108.45s - 111.45s |  But yeah, and with that just caveats
113.29s - 117.05s |  Look I'm just a dude. This is an interest topic to me. I haven't been trained
117.05s - 122.29s |  I just sort of you know black box as it got along and learn stuff. So I'm sharing that with you
122.69s - 126.77s |  There's a lot of information to cover. So I've got it probably will be a bit high-level
127.81s - 130.97s |  Come see me later. I'll get us copy the slides if you like, but
133.29s - 135.29s |  Yeah
135.89s - 139.65s |  So firstly why is the airline and travel industry the way it is
140.53s - 143.13s |  It's high fixed costs. It's very regulated
143.85s - 147.77s |  You know not only do airlines have to get approval from you know
147.77s - 150.65s |  Both governments to operate fair flights between two countries
150.69s - 155.49s |  They actually have to you know apply for slots and so these slots sometimes like, you know
155.49s - 161.29s |  I'd be for addresses where it's pretty congested at some of the airports like London and JFK and whatnot
161.37s - 163.33s |  so in fact, in fact
163.33s - 169.85s |  you see things like a big Malaysian is flying almost empty planes to London just to keep their slots because if they don't use them they
170.57s - 172.57s |  They lose them right and that
172.73s - 178.97s |  They do your trades and it you know, it's a 75 billion once for one of the slots recently sold for so with that
178.97s - 181.57s |  There's also these concept of fortress hubs
181.69s - 186.29s |  Which are like the big hubs of certain airlines that they have such a dominant hold on the market
189.21s - 195.61s |  So with that, what does the revenue management team do and what they do is basically try and maximize the return they can get on
196.21s - 199.05s |  By filling an aircraft and what they're concerned about is either
199.97s - 202.09s |  If we if you boil it down, so this is a
202.85s - 206.09s |  Bit of an academic science. This is quite a good is a few general art
206.09s - 208.09s |  There's quite a lot of general articles and research on this
208.13s - 213.53s |  but for our purposes if you boil it down really what they're trying to look out for is
214.45s - 219.17s |  Making sure the sit they get the highest price for every seat not letting it go empty or selling it out too cheap
220.33s - 222.53s |  So thinking about that, how can they?
223.41s - 227.57s |  How can they be disrupted? We're not going to really talk about any of these today
228.09s - 229.89s |  But
229.89s - 233.49s |  Just wanted to just wanted to highlight the fact that it ranges straight from
234.01s - 241.13s |  I guess using a same-day flight change or some of your actual benefits that they offer in some ways can you know produce the
241.77s - 246.61s |  Return they would get but you know and other things actually become more related
246.61s - 251.73s |  You know like fraud where it's credit card abuse and that sort of stuff or by cashing out things for gift cards
251.73s - 258.17s |  So with that how do fares exist in the world like so when you when you go to an airline website or
258.17s - 262.01s |  You know your Expedia or whatever. What do you actually see? Why why does it come up that way?
263.13s - 267.09s |  I've often overheard people go all the price went up because of my cookies or whatever
267.09s - 271.81s |  But generally you find there are things like there are things called rules attached to them. There might be
272.37s - 278.53s |  Days of the week or where the publish it there is published and the other the other concern is the dynamic inventory that's involved
278.65s - 283.61s |  It's extremely it's extremely complex computationally and there is
287.53s - 289.53s |  Written a very great
291.17s - 295.65s |  Very great presentation on the computer complexity of actually calculating these things because
296.53s - 299.13s |  Most international trips or where there's multiple connections
299.81s - 304.53s |  Actually, it can be tens of millions of possible connections of fares in the world
304.73s - 310.31s |  Actually, it can be tens of millions of possible connections of fares and flights and whatnot
310.57s - 316.69s |  So that's why sometimes when you go to book it might say this price is expired because actually you've sort of looking at case
317.09s - 319.09s |  availability
319.37s - 321.01s |  So what affairs look like
321.01s - 327.49s |  this is the example from probably one of the tools that you can sort of buy closer access to these the actual
327.89s - 330.65s |  Like border travel agent would say it's not the same system
330.65s - 334.01s |  But it's like a it's like a read-only one that consumers can subscribe to
334.89s - 338.11s |  but this is what you this is sort of what they look like so they all have like a
340.17s - 343.69s |  Basis or an identifier code and now this code is a bunch of numbers
343.69s - 345.05s |  But I mean so a bunch of letters
345.05s - 352.29s |  but usually these letters indicate the first one is the inventory code and the others depending on the airline might indicate the seasonality or other
352.29s - 357.97s |  Sorts of you know restrictions for a family affairs. So this is some here. It's just example for
358.45s - 364.61s |  London to New York, you can see the round-trip that those prices are actually the base fare before you add taxes and surcharges
365.25s - 369.75s |  And you can also see there things like the minimum maximum stay that they have
369.75s - 374.05s |  So the SU is a Sunday stay and it's an old sort of traditional
374.37s - 378.65s |  concept that they used to catch business travelers with because if you forced a
379.05s - 384.61s |  You know leisure travelers are more likely to stay over a weekend. Whereas business travelers, you don't want to go home on Friday or whatever
384.89s - 389.49s |  So as we as I talked about that they're published on two sort of basis's generally the
390.37s - 394.53s |  the routing spaces where it's explicitly show you which which which
395.13s - 398.97s |  transit points and you can book with that particular fare and
399.49s - 401.49s |  The other way is the the mileage
402.13s - 404.13s |  Or an NPM basis now
404.53s - 409.41s |  I've got a little calculation there if you can see on the screen of how an NPM sort of works, but essentially
409.73s - 412.49s |  It's using the great circle distance the
413.17s - 416.33s |  That you it's something you may have seen with like impossible travel and whatnot
417.41s - 419.89s |  alerts and your seems and then
422.13s - 427.01s |  So they can make it work through their particular hubs often you they have a concept of a ticketed point deduction
427.25s - 430.73s |  where basically you can get extra miles to finish the trip because they
432.37s - 435.73s |  Because say for instance this one they allow you to fly through the city
436.65s - 439.97s |  Because say for instance this one they allow you to fly through Chicago
441.05s - 443.05s |  So just a brief thing
443.05s - 445.45s |  When you combining these fares and looking at stuff
445.45s - 448.97s |  There's quite a number of rules that are involved and we just sort of looked at the routing
448.97s - 455.25s |  But as you can see there did speak about that Sunday stay, but yeah, there's there's all these other things to take into account
457.17s - 460.53s |  So behind the scenes when you actually buy a ticket it kind of looks like this
460.65s - 464.53s |  So how did I did have a picture earlier of a Qatar ticket on there?
464.85s - 469.81s |  But this just shows a more complex sort of ticket where all these leases my understanding anyway
470.49s - 475.01s |  But the important thing to know is that when you get your reservation your P&R
475.01s - 480.09s |  Yes, you know your six-letter identifier just because it says confirmed or on request or whatever in there
480.09s - 484.89s |  It doesn't actually mean you can board the flight. You need a you actually need that valid e-ticket
485.53s - 487.29s |  in there and
487.29s - 491.33s |  Then when you check in that's what actually marks the basically coupon
491.33s - 492.89s |  It's similar to the old paper tickets
492.89s - 498.17s |  But marks that is used and these have to be used in order or basically your rest of your flights are cancelled
499.37s - 500.97s |  Just going back to that last one
500.97s - 506.57s |  we can sort of see there an example of where there is an issue with the e-ticket even though you have a valid reservation and
506.57s - 508.57s |  You can't can't check in on that one yet
509.85s - 511.85s |  so moving across to the
513.05s - 519.45s |  The dynamic how they manage dynamic inventory you might have seen things like five seats less or whatnot
519.93s - 522.49s |  But essentially they use what they use is
523.37s - 526.25s |  his buckets which are given letters and they
526.77s - 531.81s |  And the different fans will attach to different buckets and that that's how they sort of manage the pricing
533.05s - 535.05s |  So if you look in if you look at that
535.09s - 539.85s |  Here's an example of a is example in what would it what a travel agent would see in what they call as G
540.25s - 546.05s |  Distribution systems that shows the availability for a particular flight. This is a flight from Dubai to London
546.89s - 548.69s |  And what you can actually see on this one
548.69s - 554.01s |  That's quite interesting is that because the the why is the highest price or fully flex economy
554.01s - 556.93s |  It's the highest I have and also the generic term for that class
557.17s - 561.61s |  but what you can see because it's zero it means is it's like completely no seats to sail and
563.21s - 565.13s |  Generally, we know that they
565.13s - 570.13s |  Oversell by about 10 or 20 percent most flights if they can so with it being zero and closed
570.13s - 571.85s |  They weren't not taking any more bookings
571.85s - 578.29s |  But the other interesting thing is we're seeing nine which is the maximum for any one time that if there are any single digits
579.21s - 583.09s |  So the actual business and first cabin on this particular flight is quite empty
583.09s - 588.85s |  So there's probably a chance that people will get there be a bit of a cabin roll and to feel to sell more seats and
588.85s - 590.85s |  to fill it up the some of the
590.93s - 594.93s |  More frequent flyers or people traveling alone might actually get or you know
595.29s - 598.17s |  When they go to the gate might be given a new seat upgraded
600.42s - 602.42s |  So
602.62s - 605.74s |  Moving on how do we handle connections now with connections?
605.78s - 607.10s |  It's the same sort of thing
607.10s - 613.58s |  But what you need to keep in mind is your fare class or your availability needs to match for all segments
613.58s - 616.54s |  And not only that you also need it for every person
616.54s - 623.22s |  So if you search for one person on this you would get you you would see the cheaper like our fare for business
623.38s - 629.14s |  But if you had two people if you going it it would show a higher price when you actually search
629.14s - 631.02s |  That's not like a cookie because you already search
631.02s - 635.74s |  It's because it's because this second connecting flight only has one seat available in that our class
636.14s - 638.14s |  So learning some of this can help you
639.02s - 643.82s |  Piece together and understand like I found a good fare. I want to book this which days can actually go
644.46s - 646.46s |  And net really narrow it down
648.30s - 650.38s |  So following the money where it all goes
651.94s - 657.30s |  Basically, there's a thing called a valid validating carrier and that's the one that issues the ticket and that's the e-ticket database
657.30s - 663.38s |  They use interesting factors American Airlines has all their serial numbers start with double zero one
663.38s - 666.78s |  But every because they were the first computerized airline
666.78s - 674.02s |  But all of all of the airlines basically have one of these three digit identifiers that for identifying which stock that is
675.06s - 677.70s |  You also have a concept of a marketing carrier now
677.70s - 682.62s |  that's the flight number you buy and so you might if you've heard of a code share before or ever booked a flight like that
682.62s - 684.10s |  where you're like
684.10s - 687.62s |  Maybe you've booked fit air, but it's actually like a American or British flight
687.66s - 691.66s |  That's what a code share is an operating carrier. Obviously the metal that you're on
692.66s - 698.00s |  so just an example like to tie some of these concepts together this is a little bit of an unusual boarding pass because it's
698.00s - 703.74s |  Printed by air lingus and then on and it's a it's an it's an American flight that was sold as British Airways
703.74s - 707.46s |  And but you can also see there with this electronic. There's the longer
707.98s - 713.86s |  There's the longer marking there with starting in 125 and that's the e-ticket. That's the e-ticket serial number number, right?
714.82s - 716.82s |  the the 25
717.10s - 723.90s |  Below there is also like a sequence number of how which you know the check-in or when they were at that
724.94s - 730.85s |  At the outstation when you sort of checked in online and when it went on the manifest
732.53s - 736.97s |  So having having regard to those sort of concepts, I'll talk about some of the weaknesses so
738.41s - 743.97s |  Why you sometimes see those flat fares now for getting so low like $1 or $15 as we saw before
744.09s - 751.41s |  Is that a lot of the components now come up as you know carrier surcharges under this fuel surcharge that started in 2004?
752.69s - 753.89s |  so
753.89s - 757.97s |  Yeah, initially, they're only like 20 bucks or something because the oil price is fluctuating
758.01s - 762.57s |  But then what happened was I guess the airlines realized they weren't didn't have to pay at that time
762.57s - 765.53s |  They thought they didn't have to pay commissions and other things on these
766.37s - 772.61s |  Amounts so so from my perspective they kind of seem a bit like junk fees like resort fees and stuff that you might pay at hotels
773.97s - 774.97s |  the
774.97s - 776.97s |  interesting fact is that
777.37s - 780.89s |  Because the way they're levied. It's actually it actually has become more complicated
781.41s - 786.33s |  The calculations have become more complicated and one thing that's that's interesting to note. Is that
787.13s - 792.37s |  The way and the way they're published the validating carrier decides whether to apply it or not
792.37s - 794.37s |  It's not necessarily the airline that you're flying on
794.89s - 800.87s |  So this presented some opportunities to that that could force the errors could creep in
801.27s - 804.51s |  So as I say here that is the s1 record is like a
805.19s - 807.19s |  it's just a database record that has
807.79s - 812.47s |  you know the criteria for applying the surcharge and how much it is, but
814.51s - 819.87s |  You know when all the things that matches so we'll go and the fact that it has like sequence numbers
819.87s - 821.87s |  It's sort of works a bit like a firewall world
823.27s - 828.71s |  So when we talk about exploits for this the the good old days what people were doing for a while
829.39s - 833.83s |  Was was that they were actually just going over to another airlines desk and getting them to book flights
833.83s - 838.59s |  You know like a ticketing desk and getting them to book the flights for the other airline and have them issued by
840.15s - 845.15s |  One that didn't levy the surcharge, but there was an IATA resolution and that's kind of gone away
847.15s - 850.33s |  But the more I guess the more interesting ones and the more technical ones for us
851.23s - 856.75s |  and for defenders is is the way that those s1 records work and
856.91s - 860.19s |  And they apply it so you I've got a bit of an example here from one of the the
860.75s - 863.99s |  From the apps code the fair publishing manual there, right?
864.79s - 867.51s |  So some of you may also be able to see why?
868.59s - 873.59s |  How these can sort of break or be pushed at the end of that sequence can be skipped. So for instance like
874.95s - 879.27s |  And and it might depend on whether the fair actually has is compatible with other fares
879.31s - 885.01s |  But if it is for instance, if all the last one has if all ticketed points are wholly within the u.s
885.29s - 890.69s |  Well, what happens if you have a you know domestic segment in Canada or Mexico or whatever for instance, right?
891.37s - 893.37s |  It wouldn't apply it, right? So
893.93s - 897.33s |  Just a demo of this I can show you this is this is quite an old one
897.93s - 901.73s |  People in that sort of travel community don't really like this stuff shared
902.53s - 907.25s |  But this is an old one. I found it interesting to try and even just get this to work stuff to work
907.25s - 909.05s |  It's a bit like pen testing
909.05s - 910.45s |  but
910.45s - 913.19s |  This is one here where it's a it's a fair for
914.01s - 918.81s |  $727 a normal return what we and with the surcharge of you know close to 60%
920.21s - 926.41s |  So what happens is if we actually add a another segment that's compatible there and and and break that
927.21s - 928.45s |  application
928.45s - 930.45s |  it will
930.81s - 936.77s |  You know what you're doing is you're actually adding, you know another fare on there and it's pushing the base price up
936.77s - 939.93s |  But because the surcharge was so low. It's actually dropped your price down
940.45s - 941.61s |  You know
941.61s - 944.61s |  You've added a hundred pounds in this instance, but you've lost
945.25s - 948.51s |  It's you know miscalculated the price by 260
949.89s - 952.05s |  Another thing that's this sort of interesting is the way
952.85s - 958.29s |  Because of the competitive nature of markets how there is sometimes arbitrage opportunities
958.29s - 960.45s |  But this can be a bit of effort like you you know
960.45s - 962.01s |  You might have to see if to start your ticket there
962.01s - 965.37s |  So like but sometimes it could be worth it like for instance if you're in Hong Kong
965.37s - 969.55s |  You want you know, you start your journey in Japan or you're in the US and you start it in Canada
969.55s - 971.55s |  But these things fluctuate and change
972.51s - 976.11s |  Another thing to look for is some of these countries with unstable currencies
977.35s - 981.51s |  Some ticket, you know, sometimes they or fixed exchange rates for instance Egypt
981.91s - 987.23s |  Changed their official exchange rate by 50% and there was some you know, good deals that came out of that
987.91s - 993.63s |  For a period but a lot of the other countries actually publish in euros or US dollars that have unstable currency
993.63s - 995.63s |  So it's not a doesn't happen all the time
996.63s - 1002.67s |  Another one that's I guess a bit more another vulnerability that's been a bit more popularized and talked about
1003.83s - 1009.95s |  Over the last 10 years is the is hidden city ticketing. This is a you know, a very well-known practice
1009.95s - 1015.47s |  That's you know that all airlines sort of hate, you know bash up agents if they try and do it, right?
1015.55s - 1021.03s |  But essentially you can see here if you're comparing this this is a Delta flight
1021.71s - 1025.99s |  You're trying to go to Atlanta, right, but if you look directly it's gonna be close to $200
1026.03s - 1029.19s |  But but when when a Nashville flight is tacked on to the end of it
1029.19s - 1032.19s |  It actually, you know, it's less than half
1032.39s - 1038.99s |  now the reason for that is I guess business customers want to fly direct generally people pay more for a direct and whatever competitions in
1038.99s - 1042.61s |  The different markets so they want to fill those seats, but not do it
1043.87s - 1048.97s |  The issues with these kind of things is that it is generally against the terms of conditions of carriage
1049.29s - 1053.93s |  And what they also do is if people are checking bags, they don't they don't short check it to you destination
1054.01s - 1056.85s |  That is of course unless you have an overnight or longer layover
1056.89s - 1062.17s |  so if the fare is actually flexible what and you're you could be totally within the rules by
1062.65s - 1065.89s |  Booking one of these and say well, I'll go to Nashville for a weekend
1065.89s - 1069.49s |  You know three weeks, you know in three weeks because you live in Atlanta for instance
1069.49s - 1074.31s |  So sometimes you can make these things work without without actually, you know breaking the rules
1076.01s - 1078.01s |  Another thing I'll talk about is
1078.29s - 1082.37s |  Mistake fares. So sometimes you see things in the press. There's been a few good ones where
1083.85s - 1085.85s |  You know that they will
1086.61s - 1089.91s |  in a first class of 500 bucks return from Asia or whatever because
1090.25s - 1095.05s |  someone's either the often to see that the route they allowed routing has been there's a mistake or
1095.29s - 1100.81s |  The base fare has been uploaded incorrectly because it's still I believe it's still kind of manual in a lot of ways
1100.81s - 1106.13s |  There's still a lot of spreadsheets that are used. So in the past the USD OT used to be very
1106.93s - 1110.77s |  Aggressive in enforcing this legislation on post purchasing price increase
1111.01s - 1116.49s |  But in 2015 what happened was there was a very large issue with United if you Google you
1116.73s - 1118.53s |  You might be able to find some more information
1118.53s - 1122.69s |  But essentially this issue was they published in Danish Corona?
1122.69s - 1126.45s |  They made a mistake where it was a divide by 1,000 issue on the base fare
1126.57s - 1131.93s |  now this is because Dana in the Danish Corona uses the comma as a decimal point rather than a
1132.85s - 1137.41s |  Period right. So the key thing to know out of this now is that
1138.61s - 1145.25s |  that they're they're allowing airlines to eat more easily get out of these these fares if they demonstrate it was a
1145.57s - 1148.09s |  Mistaken fare now one of the ways they would do that
1148.09s - 1152.41s |  I guess is there's a lot of blogs and stuff that sort of try to profit off this and
1153.61s - 1155.61s |  Yeah, so I mean it
1155.89s - 1158.77s |  As roaring kitty would say as to me. I like the fair
1158.77s - 1162.81s |  It's just a good fair because sometimes you don't understand. It's hard to understand I guess
1163.49s - 1170.69s |  When they you often see them publishing base fares of $1 for transatlantic flights like hat. How do you know necessarily?
1172.01s - 1178.69s |  So if you're an airline, what could you do? Right? So they have a thing called an agency debit debit memo. Now, that's a
1179.41s - 1181.97s |  You can find those policies online as well
1181.97s - 1187.25s |  most airlines publish them and that also will show you sort of conditions of what they're actually looking for and how they go after travel
1187.25s - 1193.49s |  Agents that maliciously do stuff the example of what a travel agent might do is hold stuff on a fictitious name
1193.49s - 1197.09s |  So like, you know, wait, you know like how you can do free holds for instance
1197.09s - 1201.81s |  They're basically holding the seats and then they without and then they cancel it and rehold it, you know
1202.17s - 1206.57s |  So they think they do chargebacks for that and there's like it's like a credit cards chargeback
1206.57s - 1211.99s |  There's like a processing fee attached to that. But I guess my other point is that they could kind of think like us
1212.87s - 1219.43s |  You know, I think fraud teams and other teams could learn a lot from how what we the advanced detections and things we run in socks
1220.23s - 1224.47s |  because in a lot of ways a lot of the detection stuff is similar and we're just used to
1225.79s - 1227.99s |  hackers and impossible travel and things like that and
1229.15s - 1230.95s |  sort of finally
1230.95s - 1233.55s |  If this if you'd be interested by this you want to know a bit more
1235.19s - 1236.63s |  It's great to be out of those
1236.63s - 1241.47s |  It's sometimes hard to get the same visibility into all these things that they look like a travel agent would get
1241.99s - 1245.67s |  But with the with those tools like expert flyer that I showed before
1246.11s - 1250.15s |  KBS tool they like subscription ones where you can actually get sort of read-only access
1250.31s - 1255.87s |  But it's it's not a hundred percent what you can do and they don't actually can't support pricing
1256.39s - 1260.79s |  But another one that's great. It's really really good is the ITX matrix
1261.25s - 1267.27s |  So that that will actually give you sort of a full pricing engine that you can it was basically the back end for Google was
1267.27s - 1273.03s |  The back end for Google flights at one stage and what I like about that is that you can put really advanced pairing specs in
1273.03s - 1275.03s |  There so you can say only show me
1275.51s - 1282.71s |  Only use like for the calculation only use fares or any show me stuff that's compatible with this particular fair basis code
1284.35s - 1289.13s |  Lock it down to all that sort of stuff and the even better thing is that you can actually turn off the availability checks
1290.87s - 1294.39s |  Because to get more better CPU use of your CPU time
1294.67s - 1296.67s |  So with that I
1297.99s - 1302.47s |  Guess to say thanks for everyone. I've got a few more things here if people are interested
1303.19s - 1310.31s |  Particularly recommend that the MIT. I guess it was for a computing course, but that MIT's computational complexity of air travel planning
1310.83s - 1312.83s |  Really really good. I
1312.83s - 1314.83s |  wouldn't like to talk about that, but I
1315.35s - 1317.35s |  hope that's a bird's-eye
1317.39s - 1318.91s |  overview and
1318.91s - 1322.17s |  If you have any questions come see me at the bar or something good
1323.13s - 1327.89s |  Now conscious of time let's crack on I want to talk today about electronic flight bags
1328.41s - 1333.49s |  But before we go there a little bit about me. I am a pilot. I'm a really bad pilot
1333.49s - 1336.81s |  I've landed at the wrong runway before so never fly with me
1336.81s - 1341.13s |  But I also am part of a company called pen test partners where we do a lot of red teaming
1341.13s - 1345.17s |  But also a lot of embedded system work. We've got multiple pilots on the team
1345.17s - 1349.01s |  So we do quite a bit with airplanes and over the last few years
1349.01s - 1351.53s |  We've learned how to hack or not hack airplanes
1353.13s - 1359.01s |  Before we start though, it's really really important that we disclose vulnerabilities in aviation
1359.97s - 1361.21s |  responsibly
1361.21s - 1365.45s |  There's something about hacking planes that drives the media into a frenzy
1365.45s - 1371.01s |  You say plane hacking they go crazy and a result it damages industry and I think it makes us less safe
1371.69s - 1377.27s |  My wife is a lousy flyer. So the last thing I want to do is make her more scared of flying
1379.01s - 1381.61s |  It does take a long time to fix bugs in aviation
1381.61s - 1386.93s |  I'll explain why in a bit but the most important thing you cannot do you cannot hack an airplane
1387.13s - 1391.45s |  Sat in your seat in coach. It doesn't work like that
1392.33s - 1398.13s |  There have been some issues over the years with the media going crazy with stories about hacking airplanes. I'm not gonna dwell on those
1399.05s - 1403.97s |  But before we start, how do you connect to an airplane? Well, there are lots of different interfaces
1403.97s - 1407.89s |  We all want in-flight Wi-Fi nowadays, but pilots have had that for years
1408.09s - 1414.03s |  You've got maintenance access. You've got quick access recorders that now spin up over Wi-Fi
1414.17s - 1417.85s |  But just to prove that point you cannot hack an airplane from the cabin
1417.85s - 1424.37s |  And the reason for that is we have really good network segregation in the bit in the back the bit that we sit in
1424.77s - 1429.17s |  That's called the passenger information entertainment services domain and we consider it to be dirty
1429.69s - 1434.45s |  Up front. We have the aircraft control domain, which is really sick. It sounds secure
1434.61s - 1438.33s |  Really well segregated and completely isolated from the other networks
1438.33s - 1441.77s |  But the one I want to look at at the moment is the electronic flight bag
1441.77s - 1448.57s |  Which was one of the systems the pilots use and connect to with connectivity. So what is an EFB? Well
1449.41s - 1453.13s |  Last time you boarded an airplane and you look left into the cockpit as you walked in
1453.13s - 1458.89s |  Did you see the pilots had a tablet? Maybe it was a little computer. Maybe it was an iPad or maybe a an Android tab
1458.97s - 1464.93s |  It's essentially a device that they use to make their operations safer and more efficient
1465.21s - 1467.67s |  So there's lots of different things that an EFB does
1468.25s - 1472.25s |  It's for example, it has your roster your passenger list
1473.09s - 1480.13s |  It has your weight and balance so you can make sure the airplane is properly balanced and within its performance envelope, but most importantly
1481.13s - 1483.13s |  We're still there. I just lost audio
1483.81s - 1487.22s |  Can we have a there we go? We're back again
1487.38s - 1493.86s |  Most importantly it also is used to calculate your calculate engine performance or Perth
1494.30s - 1496.02s |  now performance
1496.02s - 1502.26s |  You might not appreciate this. It's very rare that we use full power when we take off really rare
1502.26s - 1508.30s |  and the reason we don't is we don't want to burn lots of fuel because it's expensive and bad for the environment and we also
1508.54s - 1513.62s |  Don't want to wear the engines much. So if you use less power if we've got lots of runway
1514.10s - 1520.84s |  We're not very heavily loaded we use a D rate or a what's called a flex temp in Airbus or a D rate with Boeing planes
1521.90s - 1526.34s |  and we calculate that using lots and lots of different data sources like the wind the weight the
1526.78s - 1531.26s |  Pressure altitude of the runway all sorts of things that tell us how much power to use on departure
1531.86s - 1535.98s |  But before we go there, I want to look at some of the bugs things that have gone wrong not hacks
1535.98s - 1537.82s |  Just things that have gone wrong
1537.82s - 1542.10s |  There's all sorts of examples of things that have just gone wrong. For example Raven air
1542.10s - 1548.58s |  They used a digital maintenance system and they got ransomed and their backup got ransomed as a result of that
1548.58s - 1551.60s |  They couldn't prove the airplanes were airworthy. So they didn't fly
1553.10s - 1560.26s |  American had a lockup on their electronic flight bags. There was a duplication in one of the Jefferson databases
1560.26s - 1564.30s |  I think they duplicated the chart. So the map of the runways
1564.98s - 1569.86s |  Reagan National and it caused the entire application to lock up and a lot of airplanes didn't move that day
1570.58s - 1574.18s |  Southwest had a bug a few years ago. They lost their their weather feed now
1575.10s - 1577.82s |  Pilots, you can't just look out the window. See what the weather's doing
1577.82s - 1581.82s |  You need to know what it's doing up there and also where you're going and you need that weather feed no weather
1581.82s - 1583.82s |  No flying. They've a lot of flights didn't go
1584.90s - 1589.26s |  Mistakes happen with weight and balance as well. This is a really interesting instant. It's published
1589.26s - 1595.54s |  You can go and read it yourself and the airplane type was changed at the very last minute from a Airbus a320 to an Airbus
1595.54s - 1597.18s |  a321
1597.18s - 1603.74s |  primary difference is it's longer but the load sheet wasn't changed to all the passengers from the shorter plane were loaded at the front and
1604.14s - 1606.14s |  The airplane ended up out of balance
1606.46s - 1612.22s |  Pilot goes down the runway tries to rotate on the stick and nothing happened. There's not very much runway left
1612.22s - 1614.22s |  What do you do? You've passed v1
1614.50s - 1618.02s |  You've got to VR. You're not a v2. So you can't really fly away yet
1618.62s - 1625.54s |  So the pilot very sensible individual gave it full power toga and the airplane took off
1626.50s - 1633.06s |  Primarily to do with the increased rotation moment because the engines dangle off the wings so they got away
1633.58s - 1634.98s |  Because they gave it full power
1634.98s - 1640.46s |  But yeah, that was a really very nearly very nearly serious instant another one to do with performance
1640.46s - 1643.78s |  This was a confusing instant that happened at Lisbon Airport
1644.58s - 1647.34s |  Now there was some runway intersection markers
1647.42s - 1652.06s |  So quite often on the short-haul flights, you might see they don't line up for the whole runway
1652.06s - 1654.06s |  They go from a displaced threshold, right?
1654.06s - 1658.62s |  They they run maybe halfway along the runway sometimes and they don't need the whole runway. So it's quicker
1659.62s - 1662.06s |  But the intersection markings were a bit confusing
1662.06s - 1667.38s |  They've been renamed they were given temporary names and when pilots were putting them into their flight bag to do their performance
1667.78s - 1673.82s |  Calculations from the engines the calculator thought there was more runway than they actually had. So I said, hey we need less power
1673.82s - 1677.70s |  We've got more runway and over a period of a couple of weeks eight flights
1678.38s - 1681.86s |  Very nearly didn't make it out of Lisbon. Now that was all fixed, which is great
1682.66s - 1684.66s |  We lost that audio again
1686.90s - 1688.90s |  Audio yeah, there we go. We're back good
1689.50s - 1694.26s |  Very interesting incident happened earlier this year. This was Alaska. They had two tail strikes
1694.26s - 1698.26s |  So they hit the back of the airplane when they were trying to take off on January 26th
1699.02s - 1703.90s |  Amazing response. So within the matter of minutes they realized there was an issue had a ground stop
1704.22s - 1709.30s |  Awesome awesome response from the airline and what had gone wrong. There was a software bug in one of their flight bag
1709.90s - 1714.14s |  Applications there was miscalculating their load. Therefore not enough power was going on
1714.26s - 1716.82s |  There was another one that happened on April 17th
1716.82s - 1723.46s |  They had a related application issue with weight and balance, but actually I was really impressed just how quickly they responded to this
1724.38s - 1726.06s |  But things do go wrong sometimes
1726.06s - 1730.82s |  so this is an airplane that had a really nasty tail strike tore the backside out of the plane and
1731.46s - 1737.98s |  yeah, they didn't realize they'd had that tail strike until they tried to pressurize the aircraft and it wouldn't pressurize and
1738.30s - 1740.58s |  They have very sadly been deaths
1741.46s - 1747.60s |  The picture on the right is from an incident report a crash that happened in Canada a very tired
1747.98s - 1749.62s |  747 freight crew
1749.62s - 1751.62s |  miscalculated the amount of weight they had on board and
1751.70s - 1758.66s |  Very sadly the airplane never made it airborne went straight through the instrument landing system and sadly burst into flames a very very sad incident
1759.10s - 1764.86s |  It also happens on landing as well when we land in commercial airliners. We don't want to use too much break
1765.46s - 1769.74s |  Because brake pads are expensive that carbon fiber. We don't want to use too much
1770.30s - 1776.82s |  so we'll typically use an auto brake setting that's related to our weight the length of the runway the amount of headwind we got all
1776.82s - 1778.42s |  sorts of cool things and
1778.42s - 1781.78s |  this is Quito Airport very difficult approach surrounded by hills and
1782.74s - 1787.50s |  Overstressed pilots used the wrong auto brake setting from their calculations and over around the end of the runway
1787.50s - 1792.06s |  They chose auto land. So auto brake 2 and they should have been using auto brake 4
1792.94s - 1794.98s |  So where I'm getting to with all of this is
1796.26s - 1803.58s |  Could you cause an incident like that as a result of a hack and we found some bugs that we think could in
1804.30s - 1805.90s |  certain scenarios
1805.90s - 1808.14s |  So the first major problem you need to know about those
1808.78s - 1814.82s |  Computers those tablets that the pilots are using you might be really surprised to know about the quality of the lockdown on those devices
1815.54s - 1817.06s |  Sometimes we'll find
1817.06s - 1819.06s |  EFBs with no pin or
1819.98s - 1821.98s |  The pilots birthdates or
1822.82s - 1825.30s |  On smaller operators you find no MDM
1825.30s - 1832.38s |  No real lockdown even some small operators have sent their pilots off to Best Buy to buy the tablet for themselves Wow
1833.14s - 1835.06s |  But also there's a lack of
1835.06s - 1842.58s |  Proper understanding on the ground cyber security experts in the air pilots. Sometimes those interactions don't go so well and good examples of that
1842.58s - 1848.86s |  Hey, let's use face ID. Let's use face ID to make my EFB nice and secure
1848.86s - 1855.26s |  So it's really easy great. Unfortunately pilots have a habit of wearing mirrored sunglasses, which does not work
1855.26s - 1862.74s |  Well with face ID, I promise you and the one time you probably need your electronic flight bag more than anything is when shit goes down
1863.10s - 1865.26s |  Maybe you have a depressurization events
1866.10s - 1870.78s |  You go to your electronic quick reference handbook, which is of course on your iPad
1870.78s - 1875.46s |  But you're wearing an oxygen mask because the oxygen is just flown out of the door plug
1876.46s - 1879.94s |  Not a good day, right so we really need to think carefully about how we unlock things
1880.18s - 1882.78s |  so first of all, we've got problems with local lockdowns and
1883.62s - 1884.58s |  with
1884.58s - 1887.14s |  Physical access to an EFB for a short period of time
1887.14s - 1891.34s |  We found some interesting bugs and I'm going to walk you through one of the very first we found was in Boeing
1891.50s - 1896.62s |  OPT on board performance tool and this is the tool that's used to calculate performance
1896.62s - 1900.70s |  So you'll spit in a bunch of data and it'll give you your V speeds
1900.70s - 1904.38s |  So V one the point at which you can break and stop without going off the end
1905.30s - 1906.34s |  VR
1906.34s - 1913.34s |  Rotation v2 the point at which you can climb away safely with any one engine that spot between V 1 and V 2 is kind
1913.34s - 1915.34s |  Of squeaky bum time if it all goes wrong
1915.38s - 1918.34s |  Now that's actually a photograph of one of Boeing's tools
1918.34s - 1920.14s |  They brought it along to RSA a couple of years ago
1920.14s - 1925.34s |  Really really cool thing to do and we discovered that the database had no integrity text
1925.34s - 1928.26s |  So with a few moments physical access you could change the data
1928.50s - 1932.38s |  You could make the runway look longer than it actually was and therefore it spit out the wrong data
1932.74s - 1938.70s |  You could extend the runway and then the V speeds went wrong and the pilots would use the wrong amount of power for departure
1939.46s - 1940.94s |  Good news
1940.94s - 1945.66s |  Boeing handle it brilliantly. I could not have asked for a better response to this vulnerability
1945.66s - 1948.86s |  It's kind of good news for buying which I think they kind of need at the moment. I don't know
1949.54s - 1951.54s |  It was a really good experience. They
1952.34s - 1954.50s |  Responded to us really quickly. They acknowledged it
1954.50s - 1957.68s |  They gave us a call every month to say this is how we're doing it and said by the way
1958.36s - 1965.12s |  It's gonna take two years to fix it like what you know, Google project zero that's 90 days, right and you drop it like it's hot
1966.16s - 1974.36s |  Aviation is different. It took him a couple of weeks to fix the bug. It took him a couple of years to recertify the code
1975.24s - 1978.36s |  Because you can't just go and update aviation systems
1978.36s - 1981.72s |  You need to recertify them to make sure they are safe in
1982.00s - 1987.04s |  Absolutely every possible scenario and that was fine and they published it and it was all good. They got it sorted
1987.68s - 1989.68s |  Another bug. This is a
1990.48s - 1991.92s |  semi-installed
1991.92s - 1998.72s |  BFB it was a kiosk and a 747 we looked at and it was unbelievably poorly secure so you could break out
1999.12s - 2003.92s |  Password was password great and there were two of them for redundancy purposes
2004.32s - 2009.68s |  But they were networked together and it was easy to compromise one from the other so that removed the value of having
2009.96s - 2013.56s |  Redundancy and a cross-check because you could hack them both to spit out the same wrong data
2014.88s - 2016.88s |  This was funny
2017.68s - 2021.96s |  Had a USB port on it and a sticker saying not to use it. Okay
2024.00s - 2030.08s |  Now this vendor never ever engaged properly actually Boeing even gave him better kick on our behalf
2030.08s - 2034.44s |  They intervene to try and help it along still nothing and actually after 18 months
2034.44s - 2038.36s |  We agreed with the aviation ISAC, which is the industry's cyber security and sharing body
2038.92s - 2044.84s |  That actually it was reasonable to disclose in public once we told the airlines about it first and they helped us do that
2044.84s - 2046.36s |  That was really cool
2046.36s - 2048.64s |  What about some new things so we've done Boeing
2049.32s - 2055.48s |  Let's talk about Airbus. So this is Airbus nav blue fly smart LPG
2055.88s - 2060.00s |  LPC NG there are more TLA's in aviation than there are in cyber security
2060.48s - 2067.76s |  LPC less paper cockpit NG next generation nav blue is a company that's been acquired by Airbus and we found a bug
2068.24s - 2074.84s |  Almost exactly the same as Boeing OPT so you can tamper with the runway databases and make pilots use the wrong amount of power
2075.00s - 2078.10s |  So it's spit out the wrong information pilots do the wrong thing
2078.32s - 2084.20s |  So we started vulnerability disclosure and you're probably looking at going that's 2021 Ken. Yes, it is
2084.84s - 2088.56s |  So we sent it to Airbus. They've got a great piece of team. We sent it to them
2088.56s - 2093.60s |  They came back to us quickly. They replied to us after a month and said yeah, it's the operators problem
2093.60s - 2100.28s |  I'm summarizing about four pages of email here. But yeah, that's that's not a problem. That's that's for the airlines
2101.28s - 2103.28s |  Okay, that's a novel discussion
2103.44s - 2107.32s |  So we started going into some of the regulations and I'm not going to talk about
2107.60s - 2110.76s |  EFB regs because they're really complicated but they are different around the world
2111.28s - 2115.56s |  IASA European Aviation Safety Agency has is actually fairly
2116.16s - 2120.08s |  Robust on EFB regs FAA slightly different installed
2120.56s - 2126.76s |  EFBs completely different set of regulations to a portable EFB and the Civil Aviation Authority in my home country
2127.04s - 2129.04s |  Also has a different set of regs as well
2129.60s - 2136.36s |  So we look at looked at the regs and found AMC 2025 at AMC additional means of compliance
2136.36s - 2140.32s |  so this is basically the regulation that you're supposed to follow when you're keeping your
2141.28s - 2148.36s |  EFB software up-to-date and actually said you're supposed to do an integrity check and that's the one thing we thought was missing great
2149.20s - 2154.68s |  so we had another call with Airbus and said hey, we think you're not following the regs and
2155.44s - 2162.08s |  This is a really weird conversation where they said we're not going to fix it because we've analyzed your vulnerability and decided that fixing it
2162.08s - 2164.08s |  Would be a product improvement
2164.20s - 2168.84s |  I've got that in writing long version. Basically. We had a near argument with their
2169.72s - 2170.92s |  engineering team and
2170.92s - 2176.56s |  They told us that it didn't matter because you'd have to hack both EFBs at once because pilots cross-check on both
2176.56s - 2181.08s |  Well, they don't actually they use one typically one pilot will do the entry of the data
2181.52s - 2187.04s |  Passed to the co-pilot and they will verify the data entry then make the calculation and to prove that most
2188.76s - 2194.00s |  Planes now have a minimum equipment list that only requires one EFB. So that was a shame. So
2195.44s - 2198.12s |  we pushed over the period of a year and
2198.92s - 2205.32s |  They came back and said yeah, it's we've evaluated it. We consider it as a product improvement. So we're not going to fix it. Okay
2206.44s - 2208.44s |  And then one of our friendly
2208.92s - 2212.56s |  Airline clients said you know what you could do you could have a chat with the regulator
2212.56s - 2216.16s |  I'm like, why didn't we think of this before have a chat with the regulator?
2216.72s - 2219.96s |  so we spoke to EASA who are lovely by the way, and
2220.56s - 2224.92s |  We said we've got this vulnerability and Airbus have said they won't fix it. I'm like
2225.72s - 2231.56s |  What do you think and they said hmm? I think we agree and then miraculously on 10th of April. It's been fixed
2231.76s - 2236.12s |  It's amazing what happens when you get the regulator involved, isn't it? So it has been fixed, which is great
2236.12s - 2237.64s |  Which is why we're talking about it now
2237.64s - 2242.20s |  But why was it so hard? I think some of it is around
2243.12s - 2245.12s |  some of the struggles between
2245.56s - 2247.56s |  flight safety and
2248.52s - 2254.56s |  Engineering and cybersecurity because some of those are competing interests. It's so critically important same problem. We see an OT
2255.52s - 2257.52s |  cultural separations between
2258.48s - 2260.48s |  cybersecurity and safety engineering I
2261.08s - 2263.80s |  Think there was also a bit of a reluctance to acknowledge it
2263.80s - 2267.32s |  I've spoken to Airbus a few times about this and they've never publicly acknowledged
2267.68s - 2272.68s |  The detail of this vulnerability and what's really weird is actually Airbus have got a really good reputation
2273.40s - 2279.72s |  With their customers for being really engaging with them on cybersecurity. They've got test rigs all sorts of stuff
2279.72s - 2283.00s |  It's actually they do some really cool things. So we don't understand
2283.64s - 2288.76s |  Why we had to involve the regulator here. There's another bug we found this was well handled by them
2288.84s - 2291.32s |  This is a slightly different set of the package
2291.32s - 2297.54s |  It's called fly smart plus and the updater for the iOS app had intentionally had ATS disabled
2297.54s - 2301.06s |  So application transport security, they turned it off which meant weirdly
2301.94s - 2304.78s |  You could man the middle over Wi-Fi and tamper with the updates
2305.74s - 2310.62s |  Unlike attacks over Wi-Fi really, but actually there's one odd thing about pilots
2310.62s - 2313.38s |  Does he always stay in the same damn layover hotels every night?
2313.54s - 2318.34s |  You can guarantee that layover hotel is gonna have a pilot from their airline in so actually, you know
2318.34s - 2321.14s |  Where they're going to be so maybe a Wi-Fi attack is a bit more plausible
2322.14s - 2324.22s |  Another one so a Lufthansa
2324.42s - 2330.62s |  This is actually the Lufthansa systems part of the business that produce a really good charting application called eRoute manual
2330.86s - 2332.86s |  used by loads and loads of
2333.10s - 2339.10s |  Airlines, and we had a very similar issue whilst they did have a an integrity check
2340.06s - 2344.74s |  Unfortunately, the key for that integrity check was one two, three, four five six seven eight
2345.86s - 2350.10s |  Nine ten twice and so we flagged this to them. They said yeah, that's great
2350.10s - 2352.38s |  We got we agree with you. We disclosed it to them
2352.42s - 2357.02s |  What it meant was you could tamper with for example approach plates so you could tamper with
2358.42s - 2361.66s |  I'll walk you through this. So this is a how you approach
2362.42s - 2368.50s |  To an airport so you're supposed to arrive at 5,000 feet at DME 14 to the BRA VOR
2368.50s - 2371.18s |  That's your initial fix your safety heights now
2371.78s - 2375.34s |  4,600 feet till you get the top of descent D at DME 12.4
2375.54s - 2380.34s |  You then descend on 170 degree heading to a safe point at your final fix at
2380.98s - 2386.70s |  3,900 and then you can go down to your minimum descent altitude to the point of getting to the middle marker at DME 4
2386.70s - 2390.38s |  So four miles from the airport at which point you either go around or you land
2390.46s - 2396.62s |  We discovered you could tamper with all those so you could convince the pilots to go lower and potentially have a control flight into the
2396.62s - 2398.62s |  Ground. I hope that doesn't happen
2398.74s - 2400.34s |  They were awesome
2400.34s - 2405.46s |  It took him two years, but they were really good really engaging and have since asked us out to give some talks to them
2406.82s - 2408.74s |  Yeah
2408.74s - 2413.06s |  So that is me and EFBs. I want to give a very quick rattle around airports next
2414.14s - 2416.14s |  the other side of things
2416.38s - 2420.46s |  Airports are incredibly complicated places with lots of really interesting things going on
2421.10s - 2427.46s |  We were asked by one aviation one Airport. Sorry to look at their departure boards. We said, yeah, we've got bugs in those
2427.46s - 2433.14s |  We think we can inject our own flights and completely tamper with everything. They said what a cool organization said go on then
2434.06s - 2436.30s |  Put a flight on our boards. So we did
2437.26s - 2441.70s |  But of course that was just proving the point we could have trashed that system and then there would have been chaos at the airport
2443.02s - 2444.74s |  Runway lighting is also a major issue
2444.74s - 2451.14s |  We know of one airport where their runway lighting controllers were airside and then they expanded the parking lots and they ended up
2451.30s - 2456.74s |  Landside and then someone came along and stole all the controllers and the runway light stopped working. Oops
2457.50s - 2458.42s |  These are really good fun
2458.42s - 2461.58s |  If you ever fly into Heathrow's Terminal 5 they use robot pushback tugs
2462.02s - 2465.34s |  Never got to have a go at them haven't managed to pen test them yet
2465.34s - 2470.02s |  But I'm really pushing BA and IAG to see if we can have a pop really interesting devices
2470.74s - 2476.86s |  Fueling is also a major problem. There's two primary providers. It's all API based all done through tablets
2476.86s - 2481.96s |  I think there's a really interesting set of research to be done there and ground power is a major problem as well
2483.22s - 2485.42s |  I'm not going to talk about spoofing ADS-B
2485.42s - 2486.90s |  I'm not going to talk about that either
2486.90s - 2493.30s |  But what I really wanted to get to here is if you're doing research in aviation, please make sure you disclose it responsibly
2493.54s - 2500.02s |  Don't drop it like it's hot in the public. It's not going to be possible to fix that bug and publish it 90 days data
2500.02s - 2503.54s |  It's gonna take a while if you're struggling to get
2504.10s - 2505.82s |  airlines or
2505.82s - 2508.78s |  Manufacturers to listen to you. There's a couple of really awesome routes
2508.78s - 2512.30s |  You can go so the Aviation ISAC will help broker vulnerability disclosure for you
2512.34s - 2517.98s |  If you're struggling to the DEFCON aerospace village wherever there we help found it we will help you as well
2517.98s - 2522.94s |  There's lots of really cool organizations that can help you disclose vulnerabilities to airline and get things
2524.30s - 2525.74s |  fixed
2525.74s - 2527.50s |  Planes are very complicated
2527.50s - 2533.90s |  They're really really important safety engineering in there. So it does take a while to get the bugs fixed. So just bear with
2534.90s - 2536.90s |  whilst they fixed it safely and
2537.62s - 2544.66s |  Responsibly it would be lovely just to push an update wouldn't it but the chance of blue screening a plane. Should we just not go there?
2545.22s - 2549.58s |  Anyway, that is me. Hope you found it interesting. That's my email. That's the firm I work for
2549.58s - 2552.06s |  We're over in the aerospace village. If you want to come and have a chat
2552.06s - 2554.62s |  We've got a flight simulator to play with but thank you so much
