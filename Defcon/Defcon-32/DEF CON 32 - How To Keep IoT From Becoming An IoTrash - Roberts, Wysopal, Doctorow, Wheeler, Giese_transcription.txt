  "title": "DEF CON 32 - How To Keep IoT From Becoming An IoTrash - Roberts, Wysopal, Doctorow, Wheeler, Giese",
  "description": "In a world where technology and software are intertwined with our daily lives more than ever, a silent threat grows in the shadows.\n\nEnd-of-life devices\u2014abandoned by manufacturers - power our homes, hospitals, businesses and critical infrastructure. From the depths of the cyber underground, malicious software from cybercriminal and nation-state actors is seizing these forgotten devices and conscripting them into botnets and other malicious infrastructure.\n\nFor example, Black Lotus Labs revealed a chilling trend: 40,000 small office home office (SOHO) routers compromised and enrolled in the sinister 'Faceless' botnet - now powered by devices you own and thought were safe.\n\nAnd it's not just routers. Critical medical devices, essential security hardware\u2014smart home appliances. No gadget is safe. And, with the Internet of Things set to double in the next decade, billions of vulnerable devices marketed and sold to connect us risk robbing, dividing and defeating us in the years to come: a process one expert has termed \u201censhittification.\u201d\n\nAfter years of warnings from the cybersecurity community, alarms are finally sounding in the halls of power. But more is needed: a clarion call to reset, to redefine ownership and security in an age of smart, connected devices before it's too late.\n\nIn this panel you\u2019ll be enlisted to join the fight. You\u2019ll hear from experts working at the forefront of a fight to challenge the status quo and seek solutions to safeguard our digital futures.Are you ready to stand up for your right to a secure, connected world? The battle for control, for transparency- for a sustainable and resilient digital future begins now!",

 Wow, whoo
6.88s - 8.28s |  Blast off
8.28s - 9.68s |  All right
9.68s - 14.96s |  Thank you everyone for joining us here for our talk this afternoon
15.52s - 21.06s |  Bricked and abandoned how to keep the IOT or the Internet of Things from becoming an Internet of trash
21.64s - 25.24s |  My name is Paul Roberts, and I'm going to be moderating our discussion today
25.24s - 29.40s |  I am the publisher and editor-in-chief at the security ledger
29.80s - 33.20s |  I'm the head of editorial content at reversing labs
33.20s - 38.12s |  And I'm also the founder of a new nonprofit called surf the secure resilient future foundation
38.12s - 40.12s |  We're going to talk a little bit more about that later
40.24s - 45.28s |  But our conversation today is going to focus on the problem of abandon where an end-of-life
45.64s - 50.72s |  Devices the idea behind this panel really came out of work that I and others on this panel have done
51.24s - 54.80s |  on the issue of the right to repair our stuff and
55.32s - 58.80s |  Tara and Corey have both been involved in that movement and
59.52s - 64.80s |  There that's a project that has shown had some real successes in the last few years
65.68s - 67.68s |  Five states have enacted
68.28s - 69.48s |  comprehensive
69.48s - 71.48s |  electronics right to repair laws
71.52s - 73.52s |  and yep in
75.24s - 76.88s |  Including
76.88s - 78.68s |  home appliances
78.68s - 82.44s |  iPads iPhones and most recently in Colorado
83.04s - 88.88s |  I'm sorry about that. I don't know what happened
89.60s - 97.88s |  Most recently in Colorado agricultural devices farm equipment as well as b2b devices so Cisco routers and stuff that you sell to companies
98.88s - 104.68s |  Lobbyists had done a good job getting carve-outs for that, but Colorado just passed a law that includes that so that's great
106.48s - 110.64s |  Colorado Oregon band practices like part serialization and part pairing
111.04s - 118.08s |  And that's wonderful, but even with the right to repair and this is kind of where this panel comes from we still have
118.84s - 120.84s |  issues and
122.08s - 126.76s |  Consumers businesses and communities are still finding themselves at the mercy of
127.48s - 131.96s |  manufacturers and that's because our current mix or mess depending on how you look at it of
132.28s - 138.36s |  IP and copyright laws and policies as well as decades of kind of a hands-off approach to
139.16s - 146.92s |  market consolidation by our government give companies these days a pretty wide latitude when they sell a smart product to the
147.28s - 152.44s |  public and I'll just kind of use the example that I and many others have used which is you might go out to
152.76s - 159.64s |  Best Buy and buy a smart refrigerator with a touchscreen panel that hardware might have a useful life of a couple decades
160.20s - 161.64s |  or more
161.64s - 166.68s |  The software, you know, maybe they're gonna support it for three years five years something like that
166.76s - 174.52s |  But that's the extent of their commitment to that product. So what's going on over there?
176.32s - 177.64s |  So
177.64s - 183.12s |  that's kind of the the gist or the heart of what we're gonna be talking about today and
183.80s - 189.64s |  To get us started. I think it's a good idea to introduce our panelists. We got an amazing panel and
190.40s - 192.40s |  let them I'm gonna
192.56s - 198.92s |  Introduce them and then just let them say hi to you and then we'll get going so immediately to my left is mr
198.92s - 205.40s |  Chris Weiss Opal Chris is the CTO of Veracode a provider of application security and testing technology
205.40s - 210.56s |  He began his career as a vulnerability researcher and renowned hacker with the loft in
211.32s - 216.96s |  1998 Chris and six of his loft colleagues including much who was talking in this room earlier today
217.52s - 222.12s |  Testified before the US Senate on matters of US government cyber security and
222.68s - 224.24s |  Chris welcome
224.24s - 226.24s |  Thanks, Paul. Great to be here
226.48s - 232.25s |  All right next to Chris. We have the amazing Tara Wheeler
232.77s - 240.09s |  Tara is the founder and CEO of Red Queen Dynamics and a senior fellow in global global cyber policy at the Council of Foreign Relations
240.33s - 247.85s |  And a well-known speaker and writer on topics that include cyber warfare security best practices future trends and more
247.93s - 249.49s |  Tara
249.49s - 251.49s |  Thank you so much. It's a pleasure to be here
254.08s - 256.52s |  Next to Tara. We have Cory Doctorow
256.52s - 261.24s |  I think all of us know Cory's a science fiction writer author activist and journalist and
261.44s - 266.28s |  The author of many books most recently the bezel and the lost cause in 2020
266.28s - 272.52s |  He was inducted into the Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame. I probably missed a more recent book, but
276.96s - 279.88s |  He you blow me away, yeah
283.76s - 290.76s |  I'm blown away by how many how much you've written and next to Cory Dennis keys who is a researcher with a focus on
292.36s - 295.44s |  The cyber security and privacy of Internet of Things devices
295.44s - 302.72s |  he is best known for his research on these security of vacuum robots and method and
303.32s - 308.72s |  Methods which we're going to talk about for liberating these devices and user data for manufacturer control Dennis
313.87s - 315.35s |  Okay
315.35s - 321.41s |  Hold on. How do I control this large? Okay. There we go
322.41s - 323.53s |  so
323.53s - 329.37s |  You know the backstory for this panel, right is we have an epidemic of end-of-life devices
329.37s - 334.89s |  And it's an epidemic that is going to grow in proportion to the growth of the Internet of Things
335.85s - 339.77s |  29 billion IOT devices are projected by 2030
340.33s - 342.81s |  They're probably more than 20 billion now
343.33s - 346.49s |  And as I said with the kind of smart refrigerator
346.49s - 354.05s |  There's a divergence between the useful life of hardware measured in decades and software support may be measured in years maybe months
354.53s - 358.41s |  And there are currently aren't any laws in the u.s
358.65s - 366.33s |  Anyway that mandate periods of support so end-of-life decisions for devices are really driven by bottom-line concerns for the manufacturers
366.49s - 371.13s |  You know the age of the product product, you know the profitability of the product the cost of maintenance
371.65s - 375.77s |  Not informed by things that should matter like the useful life of the hardware
376.29s - 380.53s |  the cost of replacement for the consumer who purchased the device or
381.17s - 387.65s |  Even more importantly the cost to our planet of e-waste that ends up in landfills and poisons our environment
388.01s - 395.65s |  As well as you know kind of the security risks of unsupported and end-of-life devices which are becoming a more prevalent issue
395.69s - 397.49s |  More prevalent issue
397.49s - 403.93s |  so but behind all of this is this kind of bigger phenomena of what Corey has really
404.33s - 406.33s |  wonderfully termed in shitification
407.89s - 409.33s |  Which is a
409.33s - 415.05s |  Phenomenon that is a growing phenomenon and I thought I'd just turn the mic over to Corey just Corey if you could just talk
415.05s - 417.85s |  To the audience what is in shitification and you know?
455.65s - 457.65s |  60,000 people in 2023
457.65s - 459.65s |  Another 100,000 this year
459.65s - 461.65s |  Interesting concept this year
461.65s - 463.65s |  It used to be that when the boss told you to make something garbage
463.65s - 465.65s |  You could tell your boss to go fuck himself
465.65s - 467.65s |  Cause some of them would give you a job
467.65s - 469.65s |  And your boss could find someone else to do your job
469.65s - 477.65s |  Well these days all of the sources of discipline that used to stop your boss from going to a shitification laboratory
477.65s - 479.65s |  Making them have to go all the way to 100
479.65s - 481.65s |  All of those courses he melts it away
481.65s - 483.65s |  And so we have these platforms
483.65s - 485.65s |  That are getting more and more politically worse
485.65s - 487.65s |  I'm not shouting at this for a hundred hours
487.65s - 489.65s |  But I need you to keep this word with your people
489.65s - 491.65s |  Yeah
491.65s - 493.65s |  That's right there's
493.65s - 495.65s |  Put it on your calendar
495.65s - 497.65s |  There's a much longer discussion of shitification
497.65s - 499.65s |  But Corey thank you
499.65s - 501.65s |  I think the other piece of this
501.65s - 503.65s |  So is that
503.65s - 505.65s |  These are not problems that are
505.65s - 507.65s |  Specific I mean these are not
507.65s - 509.65s |  This is not just a consumer rights issue
509.65s - 511.65s |  Or a you know
511.65s - 513.65s |  Access issue it's also increasingly
513.65s - 515.65s |  As I said a cyber security issue
515.65s - 517.65s |  We're at Defcon here
517.65s - 519.65s |  It's a cyber security conference
519.65s - 521.65s |  And so these issues are you know
521.65s - 523.65s |  Forefront in our mind
523.65s - 525.65s |  Chris could you just talk about
525.65s - 527.65s |  Kind of how the
527.65s - 529.65s |  You know these issues with end of life
529.65s - 531.65s |  And abandoned devices
531.65s - 533.65s |  Impact cyber security not just for
533.65s - 535.65s |  Consumers but for businesses as well
535.65s - 537.65s |  Right so
537.65s - 539.65s |  We all know that a lot of software is built
539.65s - 541.65s |  Insecure by design right
541.65s - 543.65s |  That's why we all find vulnerabilities
543.65s - 545.65s |  In the stuff that's out in the field
545.65s - 547.65s |  And there's lots of reasons for that
547.65s - 549.65s |  It's basically a business decision
549.65s - 551.65s |  That the manufacturers make
551.65s - 553.65s |  Not to invest in security
553.65s - 555.65s |  And there's no incentives for them
555.65s - 557.65s |  To do that especially if it's like
557.65s - 559.65s |  An off brand device or an inexpensive device
559.65s - 561.65s |  You're going to get less security
561.65s - 563.65s |  But if it has an IP address
563.65s - 565.65s |  And it's on the internet
565.65s - 567.65s |  That's what attackers
567.65s - 569.65s |  Like to use it for
569.65s - 571.65s |  To maybe create a DDoS
571.65s - 573.65s |  Botnet like we saw with Mirai
573.65s - 575.65s |  Or more recently
575.65s - 577.65s |  We've seen with the Volt Typhoon
577.65s - 579.65s |  And the KV Botnet
579.65s - 581.65s |  Where it was Soho routers
581.65s - 583.65s |  That were end of life
583.65s - 585.65s |  That were leveraged
585.65s - 587.65s |  To hide
587.65s - 589.65s |  Attacks it's actually
589.65s - 591.65s |  A great way for attackers
591.65s - 593.65s |  To hide where they're coming from
593.65s - 595.65s |  Because they can appear to come from
595.65s - 597.65s |  A network that's close
597.65s - 599.65s |  To the target because
599.65s - 601.65s |  These devices are everywhere
601.65s - 603.65s |  And in Volt Typhoon it actually
603.65s - 605.65s |  Was in Guam
605.65s - 607.65s |  Chinese hackers hacked
607.65s - 609.65s |  These Soho routers
609.65s - 611.65s |  And they were able to
611.65s - 613.65s |  Appear like they were just coming from Guam
613.65s - 615.65s |  Right so when they were attacking
615.65s - 617.65s |  ICS infrastructure
617.65s - 619.65s |  So that's just sort of
619.65s - 621.65s |  A present threat that we get
621.65s - 623.65s |  It's an environmental threat
623.65s - 625.65s |  That harms the ecosystem
625.65s - 627.65s |  That we all rely on
627.65s - 629.65s |  If you're a defender
629.65s - 631.65s |  It's harder to defend if it looks like
631.65s - 633.65s |  It's coming from one of your employees
633.65s - 635.65s |  Working from home right
635.65s - 637.65s |  Because it's coming from a home router
637.65s - 639.65s |  From a local isp
639.65s - 641.65s |  So this effect where
641.65s - 643.65s |  No incentives for these manufacturers
643.65s - 645.65s |  To actually build security in
645.65s - 647.65s |  And invest in doing that
647.65s - 649.65s |  Leads to us all having
649.65s - 651.65s |  Worse security
651.65s - 653.65s |  The other reasons that they
653.65s - 655.65s |  Have a problem doing this is because
655.65s - 657.65s |  Building secure software is hard
657.65s - 659.65s |  Right it actually takes expertise
659.65s - 661.65s |  It takes investing time
661.65s - 663.65s |  And tooling and actually the tooling
663.65s - 665.65s |  Isn't as good in the firmware space
665.65s - 667.65s |  As it is in some of the general purpose
667.65s - 669.65s |  Windows and Linux software
669.65s - 671.65s |  Spaces when you're dealing with these
671.65s - 673.65s |  Embedded devices the tooling's not as good
673.65s - 675.65s |  You have to rely on manual
675.65s - 677.65s |  Penetration testings and manual
677.65s - 679.65s |  Code review more
679.65s - 681.65s |  So these drive up the cost
681.65s - 683.65s |  So there's less incentives to
683.65s - 685.65s |  Spend the money
685.65s - 687.65s |  The other thing i want to mention though is
687.65s - 689.65s |  The cost of updating
689.65s - 691.65s |  There's a cost to updating software
691.65s - 693.65s |  And we know
693.65s - 695.65s |  If you find vulnerabilities
695.65s - 697.65s |  After you ship the product you're going to have to
697.65s - 699.65s |  Update the software and updating
699.65s - 701.65s |  Iot devices is actually harder
701.65s - 703.65s |  Than updating general purpose software like chrome
703.65s - 705.65s |  And windows
705.65s - 707.65s |  And mac and things like that
707.65s - 709.65s |  Because when you have a failure mode you don't
709.65s - 711.65s |  Have a great interface for someone to deal with it
711.65s - 713.65s |  Right so you have to invest a lot
713.65s - 715.65s |  More for these robust
715.65s - 717.65s |  Update process that is less prone
717.65s - 719.65s |  To failure
719.65s - 721.65s |  And you're doing this on devices that are
721.65s - 723.65s |  Inexpensive
723.65s - 725.65s |  So we just have a complete mismatch
725.65s - 727.65s |  Of incentives when it comes to
727.65s - 729.65s |  Especially inexpensive devices
729.65s - 731.65s |  And some of these soho routers are like 100 bucks
731.65s - 733.65s |  Right so there's not a lot of
733.65s - 735.65s |  Incentives to invest in security
735.65s - 737.65s |  So i mean i think one of the
737.65s - 739.65s |  Things that is
739.65s - 741.65s |  You know kind of picking up on what chris what you
741.65s - 743.65s |  Were saying is you know
743.65s - 745.65s |  Obviously this hugely
745.65s - 747.65s |  Growing internet of things it's
747.65s - 749.65s |  Working its way into our homes into our
749.65s - 751.65s |  Businesses into sensitive environments
751.65s - 753.65s |  Obviously but it's really
753.65s - 755.65s |  Sort of from a security
755.65s - 757.65s |  And you know
757.65s - 759.65s |  Quality standpoint a black box
759.65s - 761.65s |  Which is why i wanted dennis keys on
761.65s - 763.65s |  This panel because more than
763.65s - 765.65s |  Most other people in this planet
765.65s - 767.65s |  Dennis has familiarized don't
767.65s - 769.65s |  Yes that's true dennis don't don't be
769.65s - 771.65s |  Humble has peered deeply
771.65s - 773.65s |  Into the workings of smart
773.65s - 775.65s |  Connected devices
775.65s - 777.65s |  Vacuum robots and smart
777.65s - 779.65s |  Doorbells and you name it
779.65s - 781.65s |  So dennis if you could just kind
781.65s - 783.65s |  Of tell us a little bit just give us
783.65s - 785.65s |  A sense of under the hood
785.65s - 787.65s |  Of these connected devices
787.65s - 789.65s |  Whether they're end of life or not end of life
789.65s - 791.65s |  What are the types of things that you're finding
791.65s - 793.65s |  And what are the types of you know problems
793.65s - 795.65s |  That exist out there
824.91s - 826.91s |  One thing that i noticed
826.91s - 828.91s |  Was that all the
828.91s - 830.91s |  Recycling
850.91s - 852.91s |  One thing
