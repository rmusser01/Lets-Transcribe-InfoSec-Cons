**Introduction to GPS Spoofing**

- **GPS spoofing** affects both **position** and **time**
- **Media narrative** often misses the impact of **time spoofing**

**Significance of Time Spoofing**

- Incident where **time was spoofed** far into the future
- **Digital certificates** became invalid, causing electronic communications to fail
- **Aircraft grounding** required for system reflashing and clock resetting

**Speaker Background**

- Works in **aviation cybersecurity** as a red teamer and pen tester
- Experience with airlines and manufacturers, including collaborations with Boeing
- Personal anecdote about being a **bad pilot** and learning from incidents

**Navigation Systems Overview**

- Discussion on early systems like **Non-Directional Beacon (NDB)**
- **VOR (VHF Omnidirectional Range)** and its limitations
- **Instrument Landing Systems (ILS)** and their precision
- **Inertial Reference Systems (IRS)** and their role in navigation
- Transition to **GPS** due to its accuracy and cost-effectiveness

**Incidents and Challenges**

- **GPS jamming** and **spoofing** observed around conflict areas
- Impact on **ground proximity warning system** and flight safety
- **Position errors** leading to flight disruptions
- **Inertial reference poisoning** due to GPS spoofing

**Time Spoofing Impact on Aviation**

- **Time errors** causing digital certificate issues
- **Controller to pilot data link communication** affected
- Importance of **accurate time** for TCAS (Collision Avoidance System) and logging incidents
- Challenges in **re-establishing accurate time** after spoofing

**Future Considerations**

- Need for **hybrid systems** combining GPS with ground-based systems
- Caution against retiring **traditional navigation aids**
- Importance of GPS in **financial services** and other industries

**Conclusion**

- Encouragement to explore more about **GPS and its vulnerabilities**
- Mention of a related talk on **PKI in airplanes** by a colleague
