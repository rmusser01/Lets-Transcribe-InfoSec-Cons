0.00s - 2.00s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 It didn't warn me it was gonna be bright, so
3.16s - 5.80s |  We still got people coming in but so this is
6.88s - 12.64s |  Gonna start doing a little bit of the intro we're talking about. So while everybody comes in we'll get to the meat of it
12.64s - 13.64s |  so
13.64s - 20.16s |  Welcome. Oh, everybody's having a great great convention. Thanks for showing up. This is fantastic. We're really excited to talk about
21.20s - 25.16s |  Some of this stuff because it's fresh off the presses. So we're gonna be talking about
27.12s - 29.12s |  Photovoltaics
29.12s - 34.64s |  And some of the findings that are recent for us so I have here with me
35.32s - 37.32s |  Alexander Losser as one of a
38.52s - 44.56s |  Scenarios query researchers. We both work for a company called Bitdefender. You may have heard of I
45.68s - 51.42s |  Added a link here to our work so you can refer to it later some of the
53.24s - 55.24s |  Vulnerability research that we do so
55.40s - 57.36s |  We've been doing
57.36s - 62.12s |  Among other things we've been doing IOT vulnerability research for the last 10 plus years
62.96s - 64.36s |  on
64.36s - 69.72s |  Normally and typically consumer grade devices that are popular or interesting or something that we find
70.44s - 74.24s |  Just yeah interesting to look at so during this time. We've
75.08s - 82.76s |  Published over 25 high-profile cases and findings and we have dozens of white papers that came out of that research
83.40s - 85.60s |  this is a pretty small team, but
86.56s - 91.22s |  It's been it's been really lucrative and and exciting on our academic and
91.92s - 95.12s |  Educational side so I want to quote a couple of a couple of
95.88s - 102.24s |  High-profile cases that we we covered findings that we had so I'll say ring doorbell for example edge LG TVs
102.24s - 108.70s |  This is something that's as fresh as a month old. Maybe you know the fire stick from Amazon. Maybe the August August lock ring a bell
110.04s - 111.56s |  wise
111.80s - 114.48s |  Outlet you fight ease of his cameras and more
115.84s - 118.68s |  What's interesting that through our research and what we found?
119.24s - 121.24s |  obviously beside vulnerabilities
121.28s - 127.90s |  Is that more than 30% of the vendors never reply or they don't reply timely?
128.56s - 129.84s |  and
129.84s - 132.40s |  To our contact and we try to reach out to them and it takes
133.64s - 139.52s |  Often it takes them more than 180 days to do so and what's even more concerning is that?
140.52s - 147.52s |  20% of these people take more than a year to fix the vulnerabilities that we are trying to communicate to them or never actually patch
147.52s - 151.92s |  These sometimes or most of the times exceeding the end-of-life cycle of that product
151.92s - 157.44s |  So here's a PSA to all the vendors if you could pass on the word
158.04s - 163.28s |  Appoint a permanent contact set up a vulnerability disclosure program and a you're all for it
163.64s - 168.96s |  Put a PGP PGP key on it and monitor that inbox can't stress that enough so
169.80s - 171.80s |  and
171.84s - 174.52s |  This is the has been for the last
175.48s - 182.44s |  Decade and a half or more the most haunted terrorist in the United States and abroad when it comes to the power grid
183.24s - 185.24s |  the squirrel
185.24s - 189.32s |  And it's called squirrel terrorism. There is a squirrel index
189.84s - 194.12s |  On Wikipedia and we have a couple of quotes here. For example, we have
194.84s - 195.92s |  a
195.92s - 200.48s |  Former deputy director of the NSA that said frankly the number one
201.52s - 204.44s |  threat today to the grid is squirrels and
205.12s - 206.60s |  then
206.60s - 211.56s |  The threat to the Internet infrastructure services post by squirrels may exceed the one
212.36s - 216.72s |  Post by cyber attacks and so on so on. So basically the narrative here is in general
217.60s - 220.84s |  That cyber security is not really potential
221.48s - 226.20s |  Straight-up concern when it comes to the power grid because most of the actual
227.64s - 229.64s |  attacks were of natural causes
230.56s - 232.56s |  Squirrels fires, whatever have you in general?
232.60s - 236.76s |  The grid is really highly regulated and protected and secured
236.76s - 241.56s |  So a lot of the cyber attack woes don't really apply even though we have you know
241.56s - 244.56s |  Warnings from CIA with examples and NSA and all this stuff. So
245.32s - 246.76s |  to that
246.76s - 248.76s |  enter solar
249.12s - 251.60s |  And this is what we're gonna talk quickly about today
251.60s - 257.60s |  So obviously green energy is the forefront of everything that we do. So as it's transforming the global landscape
257.60s - 259.92s |  We're seeing just you know last year
260.80s - 262.80s |  over 500 gigawatts of
263.40s - 265.64s |  Of capacity added by solar
266.52s - 269.00s |  Just last year, which is three-quarters
270.12s - 276.32s |  It's a it's an explosive growth, which obviously is fantastic for us. But at the same but at the same time brings
277.32s - 279.16s |  You know
279.16s - 286.76s |  They you know, the growing number of systems obviously brings more interest and more focus to the to them to potential attackers
286.76s - 291.82s |  So as the capacity increases, the question is, you know is security keeping up?
292.88s - 295.60s |  As both businesses and consumers are starting to add
296.72s - 299.48s |  solar panels to their to their portfolios now
300.32s - 306.52s |  Again this space a solar is less hurdle hardened and regulated by as legacy
307.32s - 308.92s |  power generation
308.92s - 315.32s |  So to that point we investigated a manufacturer called day and a measurement platform called Solomon to find out
316.52s - 317.68s |  Why?
317.68s - 322.20s |  It's because these are smart systems and they can be obviously controlled remotely
323.32s - 325.32s |  someone in our office noted something that was
326.08s - 332.96s |  Interesting after installation, so we decided to keep digging an inverter and I'll show you I'll show you a
335.48s - 340.24s |  Sketch just to see how the how the stuff works out could be added on both these platforms
341.24s - 346.36s |  Using their apps. You just needed the serial number. So it was interesting enough
346.68s - 351.24s |  So here's a diagram of a system and trying to understand how it works. This applies for both
352.36s - 354.36s |  residential customers, but also
354.96s - 356.96s |  Larger platforms as well. So you have
357.60s - 361.48s |  You have the solar panels. Let's say you have solar panels on top
361.48s - 362.64s |  You know on your home
362.64s - 369.32s |  These connect to an inverter that feeds the grid the grid is connected to the inverters connected to a data logger
369.64s - 371.32s |  that's a bridge between
371.32s - 372.92s |  all these systems
372.92s - 379.28s |  And the data logger sends information to a cloud platform that feeds into various application and management
379.76s - 382.64s |  Systems as well. So again the logger the
383.56s - 387.32s |  Is the conduit that connects everything to the internet and isn't, you know
387.32s - 391.64s |  Responsible for the settings on the data collection and updates of the whole system
393.52s - 397.64s |  In general it's these will be connected and they won't be
398.08s - 400.68s |  Because they wouldn't work. Otherwise with a grant with a grid
400.88s - 406.56s |  So obviously end users can control the system from the internet from their phones or just another platform
406.56s - 409.90s |  and they can talk directly to the platform and I'm gonna invite Alex to
410.66s - 413.46s |  Discuss and walk us through how we investigated the platform
416.94s - 421.58s |  Okay, so we started with a man-in-the-middle attack on the day cloud app
422.22s - 426.30s |  We only use the user certificate no need to patch the application
427.10s - 431.82s |  Among the traffic we found a suspicion login request using hard-coded credentials
431.82s - 438.42s |  I don't know if you can see them, but it is smart configurator at solarmanpv.com and the password
439.02s - 441.02s |  1 2 3 4 5 6
441.22s - 443.22s |  First place on the rocky list
444.95s - 450.03s |  Okay, what is the account used for it gets information about a user's device?
450.35s - 453.99s |  For example the model the version and a password
454.75s - 461.11s |  This account is not linked to any user account. So it works for any device no matter who owns them
461.91s - 468.11s |  Now I mentioned the password a logger while it is running has an access point active
468.63s - 474.23s |  The SSID of the access point has a convenient naming scheme it starts with a P
474.87s - 481.15s |  Underscore serial number. So if you have the serial number of the logger we can get into the access point
481.75s - 483.75s |  Let's see how an attack would look
484.39s - 488.39s |  First we find an access point that corresponds to the naming scheme
489.03s - 492.43s |  Then we get the serial number. We use the hard-coded account
493.47s - 495.47s |  To make the request and get the password
496.03s - 498.79s |  Connect to the access point and just profit
499.31s - 502.43s |  Okay, those question marks do some heavy lifting
502.43s - 508.79s |  But it basically boils down to sending 80 commands to the logger to get access to the user interface
509.43s - 513.55s |  To get access to the user's Wi-Fi network and just send
514.51s - 516.51s |  commands to
516.51s - 517.83s |  the logger
517.83s - 522.51s |  Now there are some downsides to this attack. First of all, you need physical proximity
523.23s - 526.39s |  Then you need to maintain said physical proximity
526.99s - 533.19s |  You also only get one device at a time and as much fun as war driving is it's not very efficient
533.19s - 535.19s |  I think we can do better
536.07s - 539.51s |  Now we looked at other platform features and
540.87s - 545.07s |  We saw that users can only view statistics and information about their system
545.83s - 550.55s |  To make changes they require to add a business account as a guest
551.31s - 554.23s |  How is this done? Well, there is a search API
554.91s - 558.83s |  That returns data about all users and organizations
559.35s - 563.59s |  In the front end, we only see the name of the business when we search for them
564.11s - 569.07s |  But in the back end, we have emails, phone numbers, addresses, user IDs
570.19s - 576.11s |  For example, we have a vote, an endpoint for a business. We have the administration name, the
577.07s - 583.75s |  Admin's phone number and for the users, we get the last login IP. We get their address if they put it there
585.47s - 589.51s |  By itself, it's not really exploitable at most being a privacy issue
590.27s - 593.43s |  But it gives us a ballpark for the total number of users
593.91s - 597.79s |  About three and a half millions and the total number of businesses
598.43s - 600.43s |  over 300,000
600.79s - 603.99s |  We'll keep this in mind as it might be useful later
606.11s - 608.11s |  Now I talked about
608.39s - 615.59s |  SolrMan and Dey and that's because until recently Dey was using the SolrMan infrastructure to run his code
616.59s - 621.55s |  But recently they built its own datacenter and migrated its user to a new database
622.03s - 629.91s |  The code also runs on their new datacenter, but we wondered maybe the code is still pretty similar
630.91s - 632.11s |  and
632.11s - 636.27s |  It turns out it's very similar. A token from Dey
636.83s - 644.39s |  will work on SolrMan. It gives access to an account that has the same user ID, but the users were migrated so now a
645.11s - 650.11s |  User from Dey has a different user ID from the one on SolrMan
651.19s - 659.07s |  So the user IDs are also incremental. A new account gets an ID of about 14 million on SolrMan and at about
659.55s - 661.55s |  13 million on Dey
661.59s - 667.51s |  This means that by creating new accounts on Dey you could take over over 1 million accounts
668.39s - 670.95s |  That's good, but I think we can do even better
672.55s - 677.03s |  Now I keep talking about the JVT tokens and let's see how they are obtained
677.63s - 679.63s |  For a normal user is pretty straightforward
680.67s - 689.59s |  You send the email address, the password, the hash password and you get back a JVT token containing your email and your user ID
689.75s - 691.03s |  A
691.03s - 693.03s |  business account is a bit different
693.83s - 700.95s |  One account can manage multiple organizations and when logging in an admin will choose which business to manage
701.35s - 706.11s |  The server creates a token that specifies the organization's ID
707.91s - 710.27s |  Let's see the steps. The first step is
711.39s - 718.95s |  basically identical to a normal user and I highlighted in the decoded token the fields that pertain to the organization
719.03s - 721.03s |  the organization ID and the group ID
722.19s - 725.27s |  At the second step using the token from the first one
725.87s - 731.83s |  we get a list of organizations that an admin can manage and
732.95s - 737.07s |  In the third step, we have another login request
737.67s - 744.75s |  to the same endpoint, but this time it's it uses an authorization header with the barrier token we got from the first step and
745.75s - 750.71s |  In the post body, we also have the same token together with the organization ID
751.47s - 753.47s |  the server responds and
753.99s - 759.35s |  completes the fields that I highlighted earlier and pertain to the user organization
760.23s - 765.07s |  Now, what is the issue? In the third step, the endpoint uses data
765.71s - 771.91s |  From the token we sent in the post body and creates the new token that has access to the organization
772.27s - 778.39s |  So we thought let's just change the user ID and email and the token we sent and it just worked
779.03s - 781.43s |  No signature checks. No errors
782.35s - 789.28s |  Didn't even need alg none. The endpoint didn't even need the authorization header. We could use it
790.84s - 798.24s |  Just like that. This is a request with a manufactured token that we sent and the one we received
799.24s - 804.44s |  The tokens here look pretty similar the one on the left is the one we manufactured and
804.96s - 809.80s |  The difference between them is that the one on the left has a bad signature because obviously we don't know the key
810.16s - 813.96s |  to sign the token, but the one on the right is signed by the server and
814.60s - 817.88s |  It gives us access to any account we want. I
819.40s - 825.80s |  Mentioned that we need the ID and email to create this token. But if you remember earlier we have some
826.68s - 830.28s |  Endpoint which gives us this information for all accounts
830.76s - 835.68s |  So this time all three and a half million accounts were risking takeover
837.36s - 841.32s |  Kudos to them they fixed this in 24 hours since we contacted them
842.60s - 846.32s |  Now I'll let Dan talk about the impact
849.09s - 851.09s |  Thanks Alex. So
851.61s - 857.65s |  This context I'll show this more in the timeline. So this is very fresh. We published the findings
857.81s - 859.81s |  just a couple of days ago, so
861.49s - 862.89s |  Take this
862.89s - 869.97s |  List of vendors with a little bit of a grain of salt. It's mostly inferred, but it's a highly let's just say highly informed
870.65s - 874.97s |  Chance that these vendors were also impacted because they do share the solar moon
875.69s - 877.17s |  platform and
877.17s - 881.09s |  Potentially is the same database and we can additionally infer
882.21s - 885.85s |  their potential impact by the fact that we were seeing
887.93s - 895.05s |  Stuff like this popping up around the same time we informed the vendors of the findings so
895.97s - 901.45s |  Some of these vendors also patched right away and informed the users about the existing patches now
903.05s - 905.05s |  Let's talk a little bit about
906.21s - 911.37s |  The actual impact in terms of you know users so we were seeing
912.33s - 916.57s |  You were estimated about three and a half million users could have been impacted by the vulnerabilities
917.57s - 921.81s |  Exemplified here and more than three hundred thirty thousand businesses
922.69s - 924.69s |  All these control multiple systems
925.85s - 932.53s |  Of course, there's a PII component. So having access to the platform could enable a malicious actor to
933.37s - 935.37s |  obtain information
936.37s - 943.15s |  About the users and location and so on so forth. So that's bad in itself bad enough in itself, but but at the same time
943.75s - 947.07s |  Having access and controlling being able to control the inverters
948.43s - 954.99s |  Through the management platform could also either overload or under load the grid. So basically user imagination
955.67s - 960.79s |  Of what could it be done here? Also, it's worth mentioning that the platform
961.55s - 963.91s |  serves about a fifth of
964.55s - 969.75s |  World's total solar generation capacity. So it's quite a quite an impressive number
970.67s - 975.07s |  Kind of put that into perspective it's larger than what the U.S.
975.75s - 978.91s |  Generates through photovoltaics alone. So
980.03s - 983.31s |  The question is does this finally beat the squirrels now?
985.27s - 989.75s |  Because and of course the echoes of national security
991.39s - 993.39s |  Follow the idea here being that
994.47s - 995.95s |  the
995.95s - 1002.15s |  Conversation generally around the grid is that as I said earlier, it's either the squirrels or natural or natural causes
1002.35s - 1004.71s |  We're not here to place FUD around
1006.47s - 1007.83s |  About
1007.83s - 1012.83s |  Solar but kind of trying to shine a light that the situation might be changing for the future
1012.83s - 1014.83s |  And I think it warrants a little more attention
1015.55s - 1020.91s |  I have the timeline here. We contacted the companies sometime in mid-may
1021.23s - 1025.23s |  They've been fairly responsive at both acknowledging and
1026.47s - 1028.47s |  fixing the vulnerabilities
1028.47s - 1033.31s |  And we actually closed disclosure to the to these findings just a few days ago
1034.23s - 1038.39s |  With that said I'm inviting you to ask whatever questions there might be
1038.83s - 1045.35s |  You can also find us at the IT village. We have a we have a little table there and we have a challenge
1046.11s - 1048.11s |  to Hacker TV
1048.19s - 1052.59s |  And please do not forget if you know a vendor
1054.31s - 1058.23s |  Remind them to appoint a permanent contract a contact for a vulnerability
1060.15s - 1066.67s |  Findings to set up a program for vulnerabilities a URL for it put a PGP key on it and monitor that inbox, please
1066.67s - 1069.91s |  So with that said thank you for coming. We're open for questions
1070.47s - 1078.26s |  And if there's no questions just come by
1078.78s - 1083.30s |  Come by the village and we can talk more. So thanks so much for your time. I'll see you guys there. Thank you
1083.90s - 1086.30s |  You
