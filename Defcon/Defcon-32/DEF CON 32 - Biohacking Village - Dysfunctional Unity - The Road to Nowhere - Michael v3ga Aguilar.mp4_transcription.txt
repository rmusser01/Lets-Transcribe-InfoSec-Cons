 Sorry, these lights are kind of bright and I have an aversion to light, but thank you
6.04s - 7.04s |  for coming to the talk.
7.04s - 9.64s |  Again, my name is Michael Aguilar.
9.64s - 10.64s |  I'm a...
10.64s - 11.64s |  Oh, perfect.
11.64s - 12.64s |  Thank you so much.
12.64s - 13.64s |  Oh, God.
13.64s - 14.64s |  Now I can see.
14.64s - 15.64s |  Hi, everybody.
15.64s - 16.64s |  Thank you for coming.
16.64s - 17.64s |  Again, my name is Michael Aguilar.
17.64s - 26.76s |  Basically, I'm going to give a talk about dysfunctional unity, and I'll kind of touch
26.76s - 33.08s |  on what that is and kind of what I'm talking about.
33.08s - 39.04s |  So me, myself, I am a principal consultant for SecureWorks Adversary Group.
39.04s - 42.96s |  My specialties range in a lot of different practices for offensive security.
42.96s - 48.64s |  Again, things like physical security, breaking into buildings, social engineering, basically
48.64s - 57.32s |  lying my rear end off to get in that building, adversary simulations, binary exploitations,
57.32s - 62.56s |  web exploitations, and also making medical devices play Doom.
62.56s - 68.08s |  That's kind of my fun thing to do for medical devices, I guess, when you kind of get an
68.08s - 71.08s |  area of privilege.
71.08s - 74.72s |  Free time activities, I do like to read a lot.
74.80s - 79.76s |  Basically, if my head is not in a book, it's in another book.
79.76s - 82.08s |  I like to practice my offensive coding skills.
82.08s - 85.88s |  Again, things like A-B bypasses, A-M-Z bypasses, things that you'll actually be using in the
85.88s - 88.24s |  field that I use pretty much all the time.
88.24s - 95.36s |  I like to, again, read constantly, but again, free time to pull off stress, a lot of cycling,
95.36s - 100.08s |  running, swimming, just basically kind of gets a heart beating because I like to break
100.08s - 104.28s |  into buildings, so I figure that the better I take care of myself, the more I can keep
104.28s - 105.96s |  doing this as a profession.
105.96s - 115.44s |  I also like to get tattoos, it puts me to sleep, and I am a fan of very fast, loud music.
115.44s - 124.24s |  So going over, let me take my glasses off, it's actually a first for me, what is dysfunction
124.24s - 127.60s |  that I'm talking about and how it applies to what I'm speaking about with regards to
127.60s - 132.84s |  the medical device typography and vendors and, I should say, medical device manufacturers
132.92s - 135.64s |  and the FDA and the governing people of that.
135.64s - 140.04s |  I'm also going to talk about a few wars that have basically been won through attrition
140.04s - 145.28s |  when trying to release CBEs, and also some of the lurking dangers of interconnected medical
145.28s - 150.00s |  devices, some of the things that we kind of need to be looking at in the future, and my
150.00s - 154.08s |  theories on a brighter future of how we can actually start doing more things to actually
154.08s - 161.08s |  be secure with regards to deploying these items in secured infrastructure.
163.32s - 167.76s |  So when you think about dysfunction, I put this here because obviously if you're thinking
167.76s - 171.84s |  about dysfunction, this is one of the most dysfunctional families that we've seen in
171.84s - 173.56s |  America.
173.56s - 178.08s |  I'm not going to lie, the family that I'm talking about seems to be one of the most
178.08s - 184.72s |  dysfunctional families in America, and this is again between the tester, the MDM, and
184.72s - 191.72s |  the federal government in the way that they manage these things.
192.72s - 198.72s |  So according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, again, what is dysfunction?
198.72s - 205.72s |  It can be described as an abnormal or unhealthy interpersonal behavior and interaction, again,
206.76s - 207.56s |  with a group.
207.56s - 212.36s |  So again, the groups that I'm talking about are security researchers, the manufacturers
212.36s - 216.68s |  that make these devices, and the rule makers who actually enforce the rules that are supposed
216.72s - 223.72s |  to be applied to these devices as they're ingested into our internal infrastructure.
225.88s - 232.88s |  Basically these groups are all separated entities that should normally be able to work cordially
234.00s - 236.44s |  together in a standard format.
236.44s - 243.44s |  Occasionally, though, the conversations between researcher and, say, the person you're trying
243.92s - 250.44s |  to work with to release a vulnerability, the manufacturer, it turns a little bit different.
250.44s - 256.16s |  Again, they have a different idea, an ideology, of how things should work in their topography
256.16s - 260.72s |  versus the actual researcher and the nuts and bolts person who actually does the exploitation
260.72s - 262.88s |  on these devices.
262.88s - 268.00s |  Again, us as researchers, when we do these things, we're using techniques and skills
268.00s - 275.00s |  that we've done again and again with proven track records to show the range of the exploit
275.04s - 277.84s |  that we're actually deploying on this.
277.84s - 282.68s |  But the issue that I'm running into is that the guidelines that are being set forth by
282.68s - 287.60s |  federal governments, the FDA, are namely just recommendations.
287.60s - 288.90s |  They're not really hard rules.
288.90s - 292.32s |  The hard rule is that if you have a device with vulnerabilities, they won't sell it in
292.32s - 293.84s |  the domestic market.
293.84s - 297.32s |  But in order to get there, they give you guidelines.
297.32s - 302.40s |  You should do this, not you need to do this, a rule like, you know, cut you out.
302.40s - 304.20s |  It's you should.
304.20s - 307.40s |  And a lot of people use this to their advantage because, again, they're not making the smart
307.40s - 313.08s |  choices that they need to make in these devices to deploy them into a critical infrastructure.
313.08s - 320.08s |  Now, the other issue is what happens when there is an impasse between a researcher and
320.60s - 325.92s |  the MDM that you're trying to release the CBE with?
325.92s - 328.44s |  Who plays that neutral third party?
328.44s - 335.48s |  A lot of times the MDMs themselves will actually be their own CNAs, which makes it so that
335.48s - 337.84s |  they actually release their own CBEs.
337.84s - 342.24s |  Now, the problem is that when you're arguing something between somebody who actually does
342.24s - 347.88s |  it and the person who's making it, they can just keep stalling and stalling and stalling
347.88s - 353.36s |  and then eventually you'll just give up because you don't want to have to wait like six months,
353.36s - 358.36s |  a year, two years, three years to put out a CBE.
358.36s - 361.80s |  And honestly, to tell you the truth, I don't even care about the CBE, I'm just trying to
361.80s - 367.04s |  get this stuff fixed in the product because obviously I saw it, I experienced it, I exploited
367.04s - 367.84s |  it.
367.84s - 370.28s |  And if I can do it, then somebody else can.
370.28s - 374.36s |  And it's not me who I'm worried about, it's other people who are going to be attacking
374.36s - 377.64s |  our infrastructure that is my main concern.
378.64s - 384.64s |  Now, again, my feeling is that, again, reporting telemetry that I have turned in, again, regarding
384.64s - 388.84s |  findings and stuff that is being ingested by the FDA is not fully, fully understood
388.84s - 391.00s |  to the full of its capacity.
391.00s - 396.16s |  A lot of times you're turning in a report with some somewhat critical and questionable
396.16s - 401.36s |  flaws, but the project will still be accepted and acknowledged by the FDA and then later
401.36s - 403.16s |  sold in the domestic market.
403.16s - 407.84s |  What happens to be able to get to that point, I have no idea because, again, I don't work
407.84s - 411.24s |  for a manufacturer, I'm just a consultant that does the test.
411.24s - 415.40s |  But the main issue that I have is, again, these major vulnerabilities and these classes
415.40s - 419.64s |  of vulnerabilities that can potentially kill somebody or the entire hospital are getting
419.64s - 420.68s |  passed through.
420.68s - 427.04s |  And I have no idea how this is getting from A, me, B, report, to C, you're accepted to
427.04s - 429.04s |  your 510K.
429.04s - 432.28s |  This does not make any sense to me.
432.40s - 437.68s |  So, again, when they read about a threat, what they're looking at is basically it's
437.68s - 441.32s |  just a single device in a box.
441.32s - 446.72s |  They're not looking how this item is interconnected or using the connections that they have actually
446.72s - 448.20s |  installed on this.
448.20s - 454.08s |  You'll notice a lot of medical devices are almost legacy devices with NESP32 or some
454.08s - 461.05s |  other device to allow a networking stack to be able to transmit this data back and forth.
461.05s - 463.33s |  I mean, we're talking about a single device, right?
463.33s - 464.49s |  Just one device.
464.49s - 467.81s |  What's going to happen?
467.81s - 471.37s |  And that's the main thing, is that when the companies look at these exploits, these things
471.37s - 474.45s |  that I turn in, it's like, oh, it just happened on a device.
474.45s - 476.17s |  You know, what's going to happen?
476.17s - 481.93s |  Again, one is that these systems, again, are interconnected, meaning that they are connected
481.93s - 482.93s |  to a hospital.
482.93s - 488.65s |  Now, a lot of times, again, to get access to that, that means that basically you just,
488.65s - 490.01s |  you know, plug something in.
490.01s - 493.29s |  There's just like networks everywhere in hospitals and a lot of times they're just not dead.
494.25s - 500.01s |  So, again, they say that it may only affect one device, but again, this one device is
500.01s - 505.49s |  connected to a multiple item or multiple plethora of network nodes through Active Directory
505.49s - 507.33s |  and other means.
507.33s - 512.89s |  And many times, again, also the manufacturers say that you're not supposed to plug in the
512.89s - 514.13s |  device.
514.13s - 518.65s |  The device has an Ethernet port, but it does not need to be plugged in.
518.65s - 522.37s |  But again, if the Ethernet port does not need to be plugged in, then why does it exist in
522.49s - 523.49s |  the device topography?
525.09s - 529.01s |  Also, again, you have to understand where these items are plugged into.
529.73s - 532.41s |  They're plugged into probably a hospital network.
532.77s - 534.69s |  Now, a hospital network contains what?
534.69s - 535.69s |  Active Directory.
536.25s - 541.01s |  So that's kind of the problem, is that now you have a device with a vulnerability that
541.01s - 545.85s |  is connected to an Active Directory network that is able to either utilize NTLM credentials
545.85s - 549.81s |  that you may be able to take and exploit and steal, then point upwards, do things like
549.81s - 554.05s |  ADCS flaws and other kinds of Kerberosting stuff to get privilege escalation, basically
554.05s - 556.21s |  take over the entire domain from that one device.
557.73s - 562.53s |  Again, these kinds of devices are also prime candidates to jump off from in the network.
563.05s - 567.13s |  Even if it's not AD joined, this still gives you the same kind of access to be able to
567.13s - 570.37s |  start doing other attacks, be able to get those kind of credentials from within the
570.37s - 574.01s |  network, password sprays and other kinds of things, looking for open shares, checking
574.01s - 577.85s |  for simple passwords, checking for anything that basically will give you stuff.
578.09s - 583.29s |  I've gotten a lot of actual credentials by just utilizing network sniffing and P creds
583.29s - 589.41s |  and other cred master, I'm sorry, cred slayer to basically analyze PCAP files and pull up
589.41s - 595.09s |  the NTLM credentials from PCAP files just from listening passively from the guise of
595.09s - 595.97s |  a medical device.
595.97s - 607.49s |  The second thing is that I don't get, again, is when I turn in a report with a critical
607.49s - 611.33s |  flaw, but it's still accepted by the FDA.
611.69s - 615.49s |  And these are things that basically will either kill a patient, take over the entire
615.49s - 617.33s |  hospital or blow up the hospital.
617.65s - 622.69s |  In one instance, basically I turned something that was supposed to clean items into a
622.69s - 628.05s |  makeshift bomb because of the access for field service engineering, a heat bay that
628.13s - 634.01s |  you now can modify the control temperatures for and the usage of pure oxygen and pure
634.01s - 636.73s |  alcohol in the thing to do the sanitation.
640.98s - 645.18s |  Now, this leads to kind of how I expect things to kind of go in the future, which is I
645.18s - 653.30s |  hope that the FDA and CISA is looking towards offering more and more support by hiring
653.30s - 656.10s |  people that actually understand kind of what's going on.
656.82s - 660.34s |  That's kind of like nine tenths of the problem, is that the people who are reading
660.34s - 665.34s |  this don't understand that NTLM theft is bad or that you can actually get domain admin
665.34s - 666.86s |  from a lower privileged user.
667.30s - 670.78s |  It's just like they look at it and they're like, OK, there's a flaw and you, quote
670.78s - 671.82s |  unquote, remediated it.
671.82s - 676.38s |  Or you have a justification to say that you should be passing credentials in clear text
676.38s - 678.62s |  or whatever the hell happens that gets in these passes.
678.66s - 682.38s |  What happens, I don't know, because, again, I am disconnected from this process.
682.38s - 686.42s |  But if anybody has insight into how that happens, please, I'll be right there.
686.42s - 688.06s |  Just let me know what's going on.
694.04s - 699.20s |  Now, a lot of times also medical device manufacturers will say this is in a
699.20s - 700.16s |  protected area.
701.96s - 706.32s |  So, again, as I mentioned, I also lead the physical security assessments for my firm.
706.64s - 710.48s |  So in twenty twenty two, like basically my entire summer was breaking into protected
710.48s - 716.68s |  areas. So the fact that it's in a protected, quote unquote, area doesn't really mean
716.68s - 719.04s |  anything. Everybody's been to a hospital, right?
719.76s - 720.84s |  They have the double doors.
720.84s - 726.96s |  You walk in. It's that's, you know, the senses you, the IR reader opens the doors.
727.44s - 731.00s |  Do you think you'd really be able to get in just wearing some scrubs, a badge you
731.00s - 733.92s |  cloned and like looking like a general doctor?
734.44s - 738.88s |  It's pretty easy. All you have to do is keep your head down, just nod to people, act
738.88s - 742.40s |  like you work there, and then they will pretty much believe that you do that if you
742.40s - 744.16s |  fit in with a certain profile.
744.96s - 749.76s |  So, again, utilizing all of that theory, having these devices in these, quote unquote,
749.76s - 753.44s |  protected areas really doesn't mean much if you can actually get access to these
753.44s - 754.44s |  protected areas.
755.52s - 761.12s |  Now, again, the issue is that obviously you need to get into these, but to think that
761.12s - 764.64s |  somebody wouldn't do this if they really needed to affect the topography of a
764.64s - 766.48s |  certain area is a fool's game.
766.52s - 775.02s |  And then one time I was challenged by an MDM to basically get into the device with
775.02s - 780.98s |  under two minutes to try to get the exploit going because they said that, oh, you
780.98s - 783.18s |  know, we have a case, you know, everything's fine.
783.70s - 784.70s |  Cases don't matter.
784.86s - 786.42s |  Again, if you have a case, that's fine.
786.58s - 791.30s |  But basically you need an alarm on it to sound if you want to make that protected.
791.54s - 792.98s |  And that's as per the FDA.
792.98s - 797.54s |  So my record for actually opening and exploiting a device in a case was less than
797.54s - 801.58s |  two minutes. So basically, you open the case, I had a bunch of screws flying
801.58s - 805.78s |  everywhere, did the exploit, got the shell, closed it back up, and then we're all good.
806.70s - 807.70s |  In under two minutes.
808.58s - 811.86s |  So I only needed two minutes on door to be able to get that exploit out the door and
811.86s - 813.02s |  then get code execution.
813.02s - 816.22s |  And then now I'm system on the thing that's going to be cutting people up.
816.22s - 826.19s |  So, again, another layer of the dysfunctional reality of what we have going on with
826.19s - 833.39s |  medical and MDM and researchers is that, again, placing these connected devices onto
833.39s - 836.35s |  the hospital network also increases some level of risk.
837.47s - 841.47s |  If it's not meant to be connected onto the network, then, again, I still don't know
841.47s - 843.15s |  why they put networking on these.
843.59s - 847.71s |  Most of the time, it's because they don't want to put a network on the device.
847.75s - 854.63s |  Most of the time, what I hear is that the developers for the boards are just utilizing
854.63s - 857.67s |  what's there. And sometimes that has Wi-Fi.
857.87s - 861.19s |  They just don't know how to disable it or they will just leave the chip on there.
861.67s - 865.39s |  And that's the kind of aspect that I hope to see in the future change in that, again, if
865.39s - 868.91s |  it's not needed and if it's not supposed to be plugged in, then don't keep the stuff in
868.91s - 873.43s |  there. I mean, hell, just put some freaking glue in the port and then make sure that it
873.43s - 875.43s |  won't go in. It's really pretty simple.
875.67s - 876.87s |  A soldering iron can do this.
876.99s - 883.27s |  But again, this is the part I don't get where they put in big words in their FAQ, don't
883.27s - 884.55s |  plug this in on the network.
884.67s - 885.83s |  But here's a network jack.
888.30s - 892.66s |  Also, hospitals themselves are dealing with a ton of issues right now.
893.50s - 897.14s |  Again, you've always seen a lot of ransomware going off in hospitals.
897.78s - 899.26s |  And why do you think that is?
900.50s - 903.50s |  And I've been on a lot of adversarial simulations as well.
903.50s - 907.62s |  And again, the security of these places is very down level.
907.86s - 912.66s |  Now, my reason or my theory for this is because, again, the legacy devices, the medical
912.66s - 916.90s |  devices that exist in this topography don't have the strongest security settings.
917.14s - 920.62s |  Other times they can accept the strongest security settings.
920.62s - 921.74s |  It's an impossibility.
921.90s - 925.22s |  Some of these devices can't even have a password over eight characters because we'll
925.22s - 929.38s |  break something. So that's why the level of security sometimes drops within these
929.38s - 933.06s |  infrastructures because of their inclusion of these kinds of devices and the allowance
933.06s - 934.26s |  for them to be able to run.
934.62s - 938.58s |  So then we have scenarios where obviously people who know what they're doing within a
938.58s - 942.62s |  network and can actually attack a system will see all these gaps in security and take
942.62s - 946.18s |  advantage of that and then launch their ransomware payloads against the topography of
946.18s - 950.90s |  the hospital. Hospitals used to have a pass from threat actors against doing actions like
950.90s - 955.74s |  this, but that pass has been revoked, as we've been seeing in the recent months, with
955.74s - 960.06s |  many hospitals again being hit by ransomware operators, ransomware firms.
961.06s - 967.30s |  Now, there is a key point, again, continuous adversarial assessments is kind of key.
968.14s - 973.26s |  And one thing I always see when I'm on a hospital network, which is odd, is an OU that
973.26s - 977.02s |  says like defender or semantic disabled.
978.46s - 981.82s |  And then there's a bunch of systems in there and they're normally critical.
982.58s - 988.86s |  There's I mean, that's data that you basically as you're ingesting as a threat actor,
989.42s - 991.54s |  you can just take actionable, look it up.
991.58s - 995.02s |  If you're in an internal network for a hospital, look up an OU called disabled.
995.06s - 998.46s |  I guarantee you'll probably find one with devices that aren't running any kind of
998.46s - 1003.90s |  software. And that's for a specific reason, critical, high target assets.
1003.98s - 1006.74s |  So go ahead and take a look if you do those kind of assessments.
1006.78s - 1010.70s |  But also, again, the gears of these organizations are very slow to move.
1011.78s - 1015.54s |  If anybody's ever worked in the medical field, trying to get any kind of change, like,
1015.78s - 1020.06s |  actually accepted is a constant uphill battle.
1025.73s - 1029.13s |  So, again, there is a way out of this.
1029.17s - 1034.69s |  And that's, again, getting good goal based offensive testers actually doing the tests for
1034.69s - 1041.97s |  these. It's funny to me because a lot of times when I come on to a client site, I will
1042.01s - 1045.17s |  just talk to the client, you know, how did your last pen test go?
1045.49s - 1047.37s |  There's things you liked about it, you know, things you didn't.
1047.57s - 1050.45s |  A lot of times they'll just show me the report and like, OK, this is some stuff.
1050.73s - 1055.17s |  But there's some similarities that I'm seeing between the medical testers that I
1055.17s - 1058.53s |  experience is that they're not too thorough.
1059.57s - 1064.01s |  Key point, one client showed me a report prior test.
1064.81s - 1066.29s |  They got the reverse shell. Yay.
1068.37s - 1070.21s |  That was it. Basically, that was the pun.
1070.25s - 1071.33s |  They got a reverse shell.
1071.73s - 1074.97s |  That was the same one that I had the POC that basically blew up the hospital.
1075.69s - 1077.53s |  So there was no post exploitation.
1077.53s - 1079.69s |  There was nothing done to look for configuration files.
1079.69s - 1082.73s |  There was nothing that was actually done as far as cracking passwords.
1082.77s - 1084.53s |  There was nothing done to escalate privileges.
1084.81s - 1088.45s |  They just got a shell, called it a day, probably scanned it with Nessus and that's it.
1089.57s - 1096.17s |  So there's a little bit of a difference that good offensive adversarial testing can give
1096.17s - 1099.77s |  you versus just the general scan and click and Nessus kind of chill thing.
1100.97s - 1104.33s |  I know it's hard as a person who may be purchasing these things.
1104.33s - 1107.93s |  Again, you may be thinking that the sticker shock of a test tube may be ten thousand
1107.93s - 1113.69s |  dollars more than your other tester just because they're local is viable for your
1113.69s - 1115.89s |  operation because you may get a pass.
1115.93s - 1118.13s |  But again, is that going to be cheaper in the long run?
1118.69s - 1124.37s |  Think about this. You get a pass for, you know, your device as you're putting out an X
1124.37s - 1127.41s |  widget. The tester did, you know, Nessus and map.
1127.41s - 1130.21s |  Everything looks good. You know, it runs.
1130.41s - 1131.97s |  You know, you can put it on the market.
1131.97s - 1134.57s |  You can turn in your artifact that says you had a pen test.
1134.93s - 1139.05s |  But is that really going to be cheaper in the long run if that device gets found to have a
1139.05s - 1145.29s |  critical flaw in the field where possibly could probably kill somebody and then somebody
1145.29s - 1149.61s |  tries to publish that and then you have to take it off with the recall and then you have to
1149.61s - 1152.05s |  put it back on and submit another five, ten K.
1153.89s - 1159.25s |  The cost, again, comes up a lot more when you have to do that versus if you just do it
1159.25s - 1164.89s |  right the first time and go with somebody who say, you know, you know, has a valid
1164.89s - 1168.37s |  reputation for testing. These things has a body of work or something, you know.
1168.73s - 1172.21s |  So when you're doing these kinds of choices for your testers, just kind of research, you
1172.21s - 1176.45s |  know what they have as far as skill sets and just make sure that everything is a thorough
1176.45s - 1178.09s |  check versus just a reverse shell.
1178.09s - 1185.50s |  And we're done. Also, again, when you are getting these things, you know, obviously we
1185.50s - 1186.82s |  want to help you.
1186.86s - 1190.30s |  So what I like to look at is myself as a budgetary tool.
1191.30s - 1195.34s |  The harder I hit the system, that's more money that you get in your pocket for budget.
1196.66s - 1201.78s |  So basically, again, you know, I like to look at myself as a kind of a force multiplier.
1201.94s - 1203.86s |  Now, again, wars run through attrition.
1204.06s - 1209.38s |  I've had a lot of open discussions with medical device vendors, but my hopes are that,
1209.38s - 1213.14s |  again, we can kind of work together in some kind of uniform fashion.
1213.62s - 1217.22s |  I'm kind of tired of people trying to sue me for no fucking reason.
1217.42s - 1221.90s |  So the sooner that they start to wake up and realize that I'm doing this shit for free
1222.94s - 1227.90s |  at like here, they should, like, you know, accept these things and actually try to work
1227.90s - 1231.74s |  with us versus trying to sue us with litigation because, like, I don't care about your
1231.74s - 1237.10s |  stupid binaries. Again, case in point, last time I tried to release a CBE, there was
1237.10s - 1242.14s |  Group A who, well, there was the first group who was very receptive.
1242.14s - 1244.14s |  Everything worked fine. There was Group B.
1244.94s - 1245.94s |  They didn't get anything.
1245.98s - 1247.42s |  We talked. We came back.
1247.42s - 1250.90s |  We talked more. They had no understanding what the physical vulnerabilities were going
1250.90s - 1255.54s |  on. They just basically said, like, oh, well, you know, I have one guy was screaming, I
1255.54s - 1256.54s |  have a screwdriver.
1256.54s - 1257.86s |  I can break into fucking anything.
1257.86s - 1260.22s |  I'm like, I don't even know what the hell's going on with you, sir.
1260.22s - 1261.74s |  You must be having a bad day.
1262.46s - 1267.38s |  And then you get an email saying, I need you to affirm in writing and certify that X, Y
1267.38s - 1269.38s |  and Z. That comes from the law department.
1269.38s - 1270.74s |  That's not from the person that wrote it.
1270.90s - 1273.50s |  So, again, I know what's coming next in that order.
1273.90s - 1279.18s |  So, again, I think that hopefully under some time we can actually work together in a
1279.46s - 1282.90s |  cohesive manner and kind of all get together and maybe have beers afterwards.
1283.98s - 1288.06s |  Also, wars won through attrition, and this is my view of companies that write their own
1288.54s - 1294.82s |  CBEs. Again, it's kind of hard because if you write the CBE and I'm the researcher, who
1294.82s - 1296.38s |  do you think is going to be the neutral ground?
1296.38s - 1297.54s |  Like there's no neutral ground.
1297.54s - 1298.54s |  I write the CBE.
1298.54s - 1299.58s |  This is what's going to happen.
1299.78s - 1301.66s |  Here's how the here's the here's the severity.
1302.66s - 1304.86s |  You know, nobody's understanding what's actually going on.
1306.94s - 1313.30s |  And again, does this feel like neutral ground if you make the CBE and you have to argue
1313.30s - 1318.26s |  with the same people that are the owners of this project and you basically cannot go off
1318.26s - 1321.62s |  of anything? So, you know, this is this is not neutral, in my opinion.
1324.46s - 1329.82s |  Again, health care is very expensive, so, again, we need to make better decisions when
1329.82s - 1332.70s |  we're connecting these devices on the interconnected space.
1333.22s - 1340.62s |  So, again, you know, the better we do with making the smart items more secure, the better
1340.62s - 1344.58s |  we'll be in the long run. We'll have less ransomware and less issues kind of plaguing us
1344.58s - 1348.58s |  with regards to severe vulnerabilities in medical devices.
1350.50s - 1354.54s |  Also, one thing of note with genetics, don't go away like, you know, just handing out your
1354.54s - 1358.98s |  genetic data to all these random places because it's kind of hard to change your genetic
1358.98s - 1361.66s |  sequence. You can change your driver's license pretty easy.
1361.94s - 1365.46s |  You need like a CRISPR and a lot of time and effort to change your DNA.
1370.22s - 1371.50s |  Again, we can do better.
1371.94s - 1376.58s |  I feel as a group, you know, we can all kind of hopefully come to some kind of agreement
1376.58s - 1379.70s |  that says like, hey, guns down, like let's just actually start working together.
1380.30s - 1385.42s |  But that's going to be in the future when, again, we actually start realizing that these
1385.42s - 1386.70s |  items are critical assets.
1386.94s - 1392.42s |  When you release a CVE for a medical device, guess who also notes the CVE, CISA, because
1392.42s - 1394.06s |  it's critical infrastructure.
1394.34s - 1397.82s |  So the more we start looking at them as critical, the more that these manufacturers
1397.82s - 1399.90s |  hopefully will start actually making the smart decisions.
1400.14s - 1403.18s |  Now, mind you, I know that they know that they're critical because they're class two and
1403.18s - 1407.38s |  class three medical devices, but necessarily criticality, I think, differs in our opinion
1407.38s - 1410.58s |  of things. Let's see.
1410.58s - 1412.18s |  OK, cool. I got one example.
1412.18s - 1416.06s |  OK. OK, anybody familiar with DICOM?
1418.38s - 1420.82s |  All right, cool. So has anybody heard of Pedicom?
1422.83s - 1425.03s |  Yeah, you have. Nobody else.
1425.03s - 1428.87s |  OK, cool. So basically it was a research project released five years ago.
1428.87s - 1435.75s |  Somebody made the ability to ingest or execute DICOM images from the command line by
1435.75s - 1439.39s |  stuffing a PE header in 128 byte preamble.
1439.39s - 1443.23s |  So basically now you have 128 bytes of free space to throw malware.
1443.91s - 1449.03s |  So here is something I'm going to show you.
1454.88s - 1458.77s |  All right, cool, cool. All right.
1458.77s - 1461.33s |  So this is a DICOM file.
1461.93s - 1465.49s |  This is an image. OK, you open it with Radiant, you'll see an image.
1465.81s - 1468.69s |  OK, this is that same DICOM file.
1468.81s - 1470.53s |  This is that same DICOM file running.
1475.48s - 1478.28s |  Let's see. And well, a second ago.
1478.32s - 1479.84s |  Oh, that's why no network, huh?
1479.96s - 1483.35s |  Funny. Damn it.
1484.15s - 1492.13s |  Sorry. So basically the whole long story is you can actually execute these images from the
1492.13s - 1494.05s |  command line and you'll get a reverse shell.
1494.29s - 1497.17s |  I'm not going to tell you how, because I have tooling to do this.
1497.17s - 1502.45s |  And the issue is that the researcher who originally did release this did not release a
1502.45s - 1508.41s |  POC. Now, the other issue is that antivirus engines have a hard time scanning these
1508.41s - 1511.41s |  types of files. Reason being is, again, it looks like an image.
1511.41s - 1512.45s |  It opens like an image.
1512.61s - 1514.65s |  In all purposes, it is an image.
1514.77s - 1519.57s |  If you open it up with a DICOM viewer, it will open up and show you the actual image.
1519.69s - 1522.77s |  So that's the issue, is that you lose no file integrity.
1522.77s - 1524.01s |  The image is still intact.
1524.13s - 1527.69s |  And now you've chucked 128 bytes of malware and you'll get a reverse shell.
1527.93s - 1531.85s |  If you would like to talk more about that kind of thing, I'll be in the biohacking
1531.85s - 1536.13s |  village doing this to multiple people who ingest DICOM files.
1536.41s - 1538.45s |  So it's going to be an interesting time.
1539.25s - 1543.93s |  But necessarily, again, you can take theoretical research and turn it into actionable
1543.93s - 1548.89s |  data. So now I have a project that, again, shoves malware into DICOM images.
1549.01s - 1553.05s |  And due to the way that you have to keep these images, they'll now be on disk for
1553.05s - 1555.61s |  about five to ten years because of rules with deletion.
1556.05s - 1560.05s |  Also, there's a worm that will overwrite all of the headers for all the other files
1560.05s - 1564.25s |  that are DICOM in the same directory and basically make them do the same thing.
1565.41s - 1566.21s |  So enjoy that.
1566.21s - 1578.41s |  And other than that, basically, in the end, we can all work together and hopefully we
1578.41s - 1582.89s |  come to some kind of cohesive conclusion where we can actually do things like kind of
1582.89s - 1585.21s |  like a family versus like apart from each other.
1586.21s - 1588.05s |  And I'll make sure to get these slides online.
1588.05s - 1591.57s |  Sorry, kind of depressed for time and everything was going kind of slow initially.
1591.57s - 1596.77s |  Normally, I'm pretty spitfire, but tried to talk a little slower.
1597.69s - 1599.29s |  But that's the end.
1599.45s - 1601.41s |  Any questions really quick before we get out?
1604.78s - 1605.42s |  All right, good to go.
