**Digital Emblems Overview**
- **Digital Emblems**: A neologism requiring explanation for its technical interest.
- **Purpose**: To supplement or replace physical markings required under international law.
- **Current Efforts**: The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is working on a common global marking protocol.

**Physical Markings and Issues**
- **Examples**:
  - Press photographer markings
  - ISO container marking
  - UN blue helmets for peacekeepers
  - Chemical weapons components markings
  - Phytosanitary marking for wood crates and pallets
  - Radioactive material markings
  - Diplomatic pouch markings per Vienna Convention of 1961
- **Problems with Physical Markings**:
  - Difficult to verify authorization and misuse
  - Not optimized for machine readability
  - Cannot be applied to non-physical entities

**Digital Emblems Benefits**
- **Machine Readability**: Designed for digital data, not just physical objects.
- **Cryptographic Authentication**: Offers capabilities like revocation and ensuring authenticity.
- **Standardization Targets**:
  - **Assets**: People, places, things, data at rest, data in flight, and online services.

**Challenges and Misconceptions**
- **Protection Limitations**: Emblems do not prevent attacks but aid legal processes.
- **Copy Vulnerability**: Copying a QR code does not compromise the system, similar to copying a URL.

**Implementation and Validation**
- **Issuer and Validator Roles**:
  - **Issuer**: Creates and signs digital emblems.
  - **Validator**: Evaluates the authenticity and description of the asset.
- **Use Case Examples**:
  - **Military**: Differentiating protected and non-protected targets.
  - **Customs**: Simplifying the validation of shipments.

**Technical Details**
- **Data Distribution**:
  - **For data at rest**: Encapsulation, side-by-side, or within data.
  - **For data in flight**: Use of TLS and DNS-based solutions.
- **Technologies**:
  - **RFID, DNS, DNSSEC, DANE**
  - **Optical and Audio Beacons**: For modulating data on existing signals.

**Use Cases and Applications**
- **Diplomatic Pouches**: Ensuring legitimate shipments without inspection.
- **UNESCO Artworks**: Tracking protected cultural artifacts.
- **Press Identification**: Establishing non-combatant status for journalists.
- **CITES and Aviation**: Handling endangered species and civilian aircraft protection.

**Future Considerations**
- **Standards Development**: Ongoing efforts in the IETF to create open standards.
- **Potential for Broader Applications**: Beyond current focus, including IoT and traffic systems.

**Conclusion**
- The session emphasizes the need for input on security and privacy vulnerabilities in the proposed standard. The ongoing work seeks to establish a robust, open standard for digital emblems.
