2.16s - 6.28s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 This is Alan Baranov.
6.28s - 13.96s |  Alan's from DCG 11613 in Melbourne, Australia, or Melbourne, as they pronounce it there.
13.96s - 17.52s |  I had to actually ask them how to pronounce that, by the way.
17.52s - 22.00s |  Alan is presenting A Brief History of GRC.
22.00s - 29.32s |  Alan is the founder of DCG 11613 in Melbourne and is a self-proclaimed AAA-rated GRC hacker,
29.32s - 34.56s |  having presented similar talks at DEF CON villages and PCI Council events.
34.56s - 38.48s |  So with that, I'll take it away, Aldebaran.
38.48s - 39.82s |  Okay.
39.82s - 42.52s |  Thank you very much for having me.
42.52s - 50.76s |  It's kind of my thing that I'll usually present in Excel, just as it's become almost my trademark.
50.76s - 58.68s |  So I'm going to try and do this in Excel, see how it goes.
58.68s - 64.20s |  This is a brand, brand new talk, so it's kind of in beta testing at the moment.
64.20s - 69.28s |  So hopefully it gives you the good information that you need.
69.28s - 70.28s |  Yeah.
70.28s - 76.12s |  Thank you very much to the DCG VR team for having me on here.
76.12s - 82.28s |  I haven't been as involved with DCG this year as I would have liked to, but hopefully in
82.28s - 86.52s |  the next 12 months, I'll be spending more time with you guys.
86.52s - 88.04s |  My name is Alan Baranov.
88.40s - 94.80s |  My hacker name is Aldebaran, something I've been using for 30 years now.
94.80s - 103.72s |  I'm, yeah, as we said, founder of DCG 11613 down in Melbourne, Australia.
103.72s - 105.92s |  And yeah, I started...
105.92s - 109.16s |  Alan, I don't know if you can hear us, but we lost you.
109.16s - 117.50s |  Am I back again?
117.50s - 119.94s |  Yep, you're back again.
119.94s - 120.94s |  Okay.
120.94s - 123.74s |  No idea what's going on.
124.42s - 128.86s |  Let me just try to switch to a different network.
128.86s - 134.02s |  I think it's the aggravate the speaker flag in the speaker options.
134.02s - 139.62s |  Well, but for Hoodie, who's streaming, you stayed solid the whole time.
139.62s - 146.99s |  So it could be something related to us or something, who knows?
146.99s - 147.99s |  Hmm.
147.99s - 152.10s |  Okay.
152.10s - 153.10s |  Okay.
153.10s - 154.10s |  Let me, give me two seconds.
154.42s - 162.06s |  Let me just try and see if I can...
162.06s - 163.06s |  Australian internet.
163.06s - 188.98s |  Yeah, you seem to be stable at the moment.
188.98s - 193.34s |  Can you...
193.34s - 196.50s |  Yeah, we hear you and see you're okay now.
196.50s - 197.50s |  Okay.
197.50s - 200.50s |  I'm just adjusting myself.
200.50s - 201.50s |  I'm kind of...
201.50s - 202.50s |  Oh, okay.
202.50s - 203.50s |  In the middle of nowhere.
203.50s - 204.50s |  All right.
204.50s - 229.38s |  Let's try that again.
229.38s - 230.38s |  Okay.
230.38s - 231.38s |  So, yeah.
231.38s - 237.18s |  So we started off in 2019.
237.18s - 246.22s |  We really got going in 2020, which was the year of DC28, which is a scary four years
246.22s - 247.22s |  ago.
247.22s - 258.10s |  So this talk is a bit of a view of my life.
258.10s - 263.06s |  So hopefully it's not terribly boring.
264.06s - 272.90s |  I know that when I was at university, in our kind of graduation ceremony, we had a guy
272.90s - 277.86s |  who came to speak about his life, and it was probably the most boring speech I've ever
277.86s - 282.58s |  heard in my entire life, because it was just him looking back at his own life, and that
282.58s - 283.82s |  was really terrible.
283.82s - 288.90s |  I got basically nothing out of it.
288.90s - 293.46s |  But I think, you know, I've been around for 30 years.
293.46s - 300.74s |  A lot of people ask me, how did you get into cyber, why GRC, why did you choose it?
300.74s - 307.22s |  And usually, you know, they're expecting a quick answer, which is not an easy thing for
307.22s - 312.18s |  me to be able to do, because I've got 30 years of experience.
312.18s - 317.32s |  And you know, even in 30 minutes, that's not going to be the easiest thing to do.
317.32s - 322.92s |  So let's begin, see how it goes.
322.92s - 323.92s |  All right.
323.92s - 328.88s |  So one of the things that I'm very interested in is something called BizSec, I think is
328.88s - 331.80s |  the future of GRC.
331.80s - 339.64s |  I've always said that I want to put this as a slide, just to kind of promote the idea.
339.64s - 340.64s |  So here it is.
340.64s - 351.18s |  So he, Alan's still working on the stream, if anybody wants to go to dcgvr.org slash
351.18s - 353.66s |  stream and go to the YouTube stream.
353.66s - 354.66s |  Yep.
354.66s - 360.15s |  Okay, do I keep disappearing?
360.15s - 363.15s |  No, no, you're fine.
363.15s - 364.15s |  Okay.
364.15s - 368.43s |  Okay, so just a bit about me.
368.43s - 373.19s |  So I am a principal consultant at a company called CyberCX.
373.19s - 376.79s |  Maybe put the slide up so that people can realize that you're an expert in what you're
376.79s - 377.79s |  talking about.
377.79s - 382.63s |  But actually, I should be because I'm talking about really my own life and my experiences.
382.63s - 385.27s |  So we'll jump across.
385.27s - 393.11s |  You're welcome to scan the QR code, it won't give you a rickroll, this is a rickroll.
393.11s - 395.59s |  And yeah, why GRC?
395.59s - 402.79s |  So since I put out a whole thing about what is what are the coolest careers in cyber?
402.79s - 406.51s |  GRC didn't even make the list.
406.51s - 409.11s |  So yeah, the list is like 12.
409.11s - 413.39s |  It's got stuff like technical director and security architects on it, but it doesn't
413.39s - 417.96s |  have GRC.
417.96s - 421.92s |  So yeah.
421.92s - 422.92s |  Just disappeared.
422.92s - 426.80s |  Just wow, is my audio not working?
426.80s - 427.80s |  No, you're good.
427.80s - 428.80s |  Oh, okay.
428.80s - 429.80s |  Yeah.
429.80s - 432.24s |  The YouTube stream is still going.
432.24s - 435.80s |  So I'm waiting to see if- Yeah, I'm watching the video.
435.80s - 436.80s |  Okay.
436.80s - 437.80s |  Am I still on?
437.80s - 438.80s |  We can probably pop back in.
438.80s - 439.80s |  We're patient.
439.80s - 440.80s |  Yeah, yeah.
440.80s - 441.80s |  Yeah.
441.80s - 442.80s |  Okay.
442.80s - 445.37s |  You're back.
445.37s - 446.37s |  There he is.
446.37s - 447.37s |  Am I back?
447.37s - 448.37s |  Okay.
448.37s - 449.37s |  Yeah.
449.37s - 455.29s |  When I change slides, I think I might just have to click back onto the actual browser
455.29s - 457.97s |  and- Okay.
457.97s - 464.01s |  So usually when I present this talk, I do a bit of a Jeopardy.
464.01s - 468.01s |  Yes, I have done Hacker Jeopardy inside Excel.
468.01s - 471.69s |  It doesn't work in a virtual context, unfortunately.
471.69s - 477.53s |  So I'll have to come through to DEF CON one year and actually present it live.
477.53s - 489.15s |  So let's get past that.
489.15s - 491.15s |  Let's just reset the slides.
491.15s - 515.91s |  Oh, he's disappeared again.
515.91s - 518.39s |  I really don't like him messing with the slides.
518.39s - 519.39s |  He said that.
519.39s - 520.39s |  I'm sure now.
520.39s - 521.39s |  Yeah.
521.39s - 524.39s |  He should appear any second now.
524.39s - 525.39s |  Yeah.
525.39s - 526.39s |  He'll come back.
526.39s - 527.39s |  Any second.
527.39s - 528.39s |  Any, just any.
528.39s - 529.39s |  There he is.
529.39s - 530.39s |  Okay.
530.39s - 531.39s |  Yeah.
531.39s - 539.35s |  It seems like I need to- I don't know why it's having issues, but every time I need
539.35s - 544.63s |  to change slides, I need to click back into Chrome, but I've learned that now and we can
544.63s - 546.23s |  work with that.
546.23s - 551.68s |  So yeah.
551.68s - 552.68s |  Okay.
552.68s - 556.12s |  So I'm going to leave out my childhood, except yeah, I was just the classic nerd, glasses,
556.12s - 557.88s |  quick learner, had ADHD.
557.88s - 562.88s |  So while I could do well at school, didn't really do well at school.
562.88s - 569.40s |  Spent most of my time trying to avoid people, which meant I spent more time with my VIC-20
569.40s - 572.36s |  and then IBM PC.
572.36s - 578.68s |  So yeah, I had a 286 with a whole meg of memory and 40 megs of hard drive.
578.68s - 587.44s |  Neither of which Windows, sorry, neither of which DOS could handle.
587.44s - 592.96s |  And yeah, I had at my school had one computer of which I didn't have access to, and I had
592.96s - 598.88s |  to go to private school, in which case to learn computers.
598.88s - 602.16s |  But I think my story probably starts in earnest in university.
602.16s - 607.88s |  So my first year of university was the first year that university opened up access to the
608.08s - 611.08s |  internet for undergraduates.
611.08s - 614.76s |  It was only open to those that were doing a Bachelor of Science, which I wasn't.
614.76s - 618.80s |  But if they're going to use default passwords on all their accounts, then, you know, people
618.80s - 622.12s |  are just going to be able to use those accounts.
622.12s - 624.64s |  In theory, anyway, allegedly.
624.64s - 629.76s |  For the first two years I was on the internet, it was a playground of about a thousand students
629.76s - 630.76s |  in South Africa.
630.76s - 632.84s |  There was no one else there.
632.84s - 637.20s |  But things were about to change.
637.20s - 643.20s |  At university, I did a BCom, which was a bit of a change of direction for me, because
643.20s - 645.80s |  I was more technical.
645.80s - 648.96s |  But I learned important things that I still use today.
648.96s - 656.40s |  So systems thinking, the importance of documentation, how to do negotiation, how businesses work,
656.40s - 658.32s |  how the finances work, et cetera.
658.32s - 662.04s |  So all useful things.
662.04s - 666.56s |  And yeah, it was definitely well worth doing.
666.60s - 674.68s |  One of the things I just wanted to point out is I had a lecturer there that was a bit different,
674.68s - 677.00s |  and he made us think differently.
677.00s - 681.16s |  He was probably 20 years ahead of his time.
681.16s - 688.64s |  And he taught us stuff like, for instance, what we call the nine laws of God.
688.64s - 696.47s |  I'm changing slides.
696.47s - 699.47s |  I'll come back.
700.07s - 706.67s |  Nine laws of God, which is from Kevin Kelly, which I still use to this day, because it's
706.67s - 708.67s |  basically, how do you manage chaos?
708.67s - 713.67s |  And they're pretty interesting.
713.67s - 717.67s |  Some of the stuff that we learned then is he actually asked us, what is a PC?
717.67s - 719.67s |  How do you define a PC?
719.67s - 725.67s |  And you obviously know what that is, but when someone actually asks you a simple question
725.87s - 728.87s |  like that and is like, well, are you sure about that?
728.87s - 730.87s |  You start doubting yourself.
730.87s - 735.87s |  So, you know, do you have to have storage in a PC?
735.87s - 737.87s |  Is that what makes it?
737.87s - 739.87s |  What if you separate the pieces?
739.87s - 743.87s |  What if one's in the U.S. and one's in, say, Australia?
743.87s - 745.87s |  Like, how does that all work?
745.87s - 747.87s |  What if you do processing here or whatever?
747.87s - 749.87s |  And it was quite interesting.
750.07s - 754.07s |  It was about the same time that Sun were introducing Java.
754.07s - 760.07s |  And the idea of Java was that you could transport software wherever you wanted to have it.
760.07s - 764.07s |  It never quite met those lofty goals, but it was interesting.
764.07s - 770.07s |  I think Java, the idea behind Java was similar to what we're seeing with Docker.
770.07s - 776.07s |  And there were, you know, there was a lot of, you know, there was a lot of, you know,
776.27s - 784.27s |  And there were, you know, it really made us think about how things work.
784.27s - 788.27s |  While I was at university, I got bitten by three bugs.
788.27s - 790.27s |  All pretty much related.
790.27s - 793.27s |  So I got really into open source.
793.27s - 797.27s |  I think we should just turn it into a drinking game at this point.
797.27s - 799.27s |  Every time it happens, take a sip.
799.27s - 801.27s |  Coffee, whatever you got.
801.27s - 803.27s |  But it's a drinking game.
803.47s - 806.47s |  I'm going to be so overdosed on caffeine with that.
809.47s - 813.47s |  Yeah, so I got bitten by the open source bug.
813.47s - 815.47s |  Yeah, well, this is why we're hackers.
815.47s - 817.47s |  We improvise, adapt, and overcome.
817.47s - 819.47s |  Yep.
819.47s - 821.47s |  That's why I said I had Chrome.
821.47s - 822.47s |  I swapped to Brave.
822.47s - 823.47s |  I swapped to Edge.
823.47s - 825.47s |  And now it's working.
825.47s - 832.10s |  Yeah, so I got bitten by the open source bug.
832.30s - 836.30s |  And, yeah, basically got into Linux.
836.30s - 838.30s |  Just basically because I wanted root.
838.30s - 840.30s |  And I wanted my own roots.
840.30s - 844.30s |  And so I got into that.
844.30s - 846.30s |  Learned a lot about it.
846.30s - 850.30s |  And then at the same time at university, got into the internet.
850.30s - 852.30s |  The internet was starting.
852.30s - 854.30s |  IRC.
854.30s - 858.30s |  Which was chatting with people all across the world.
858.30s - 860.30s |  Which was quite amazing.
860.50s - 869.50s |  One of the things, one of the kind of highlights of that time was going into Dutch IRC and speaking Afrikaans.
869.50s - 871.50s |  Which is a South African language.
871.50s - 873.50s |  Which is based on Dutch, but is not quite Dutch.
873.50s - 876.50s |  And being able to talk to people.
878.50s - 882.50s |  You know, kind of learn new cultures.
882.50s - 884.50s |  Learn new things.
884.50s - 888.50s |  One of the more interesting things that came out of IRC were the meetups.
888.70s - 892.70s |  So I started a couple of meetups in Johannesburg where I lived.
892.70s - 896.70s |  Mostly when friends came up from other parts of the country.
896.70s - 898.70s |  And we wanted to meet up.
898.70s - 900.70s |  I put them together.
900.70s - 902.70s |  And then eventually they just grew into something.
902.70s - 906.70s |  Okay, well, I can't see you for some reason or hear you.
906.70s - 910.70s |  Is there any way someone else can show his slides?
910.70s - 912.70s |  Do we have a copy of them?
912.70s - 914.70s |  And then he can just talk.
914.70s - 916.70s |  Y'all can just switch them for him.
916.90s - 918.90s |  Someone seems to be with that.
918.90s - 920.90s |  If you would release the file.
920.90s - 922.90s |  He's back now.
922.90s - 924.90s |  Am I back?
924.90s - 926.90s |  All right.
926.90s - 928.90s |  So what I'll do is I'll just leave the slides out.
928.90s - 930.90s |  Then that's fine.
930.90s - 932.90s |  They're just there to back it all up.
936.18s - 942.47s |  Am I still around?
942.47s - 944.47s |  Is everything still okay?
944.47s - 946.47s |  Yep, you're doing fine.
946.47s - 948.47s |  Just let me know.
948.47s - 950.47s |  Where did you guys get up to?
950.67s - 954.67s |  You were talking about meetups in Johannesburg.
954.67s - 956.67s |  Yeah, okay.
956.67s - 958.67s |  So you haven't missed too much.
958.67s - 960.67s |  Okay.
960.67s - 964.67s |  And then basically we just started doing those on a weekly or monthly basis.
964.67s - 970.92s |  And, yeah.
970.92s - 974.92s |  One of the things that's very
974.92s - 978.65s |  that kind of came out of that
978.65s - 980.65s |  is the idea that
980.65s - 982.65s |  working with people
982.65s - 984.65s |  it's always about the people.
984.85s - 986.85s |  You know, technology is amazing.
986.85s - 988.85s |  But what is technology?
988.85s - 990.85s |  It's basically the thing that gets us to our people.
992.85s - 994.85s |  So at the time
994.85s - 996.85s |  my first jobs
996.85s - 998.85s |  were customer facing.
998.85s - 1000.85s |  So sitting on phone calls, helping people connect to the internet
1000.85s - 1002.85s |  for the first time.
1002.85s - 1004.85s |  That was an amazing thing
1004.85s - 1006.85s |  to watch them find this new world
1006.85s - 1008.85s |  that they didn't even know existed.
1008.85s - 1010.85s |  Hey, Adam, we lost you again.
1010.85s - 1012.85s |  You know, if only I was closer.
1013.05s - 1018.19s |  Well, it seems like Hoodie is still able to see him.
1018.19s - 1020.19s |  So maybe just keep going and recording.
1020.19s - 1022.19s |  Okay.
1022.19s - 1024.19s |  It's not actually my internet.
1024.19s - 1026.19s |  My internet seems fine.
1026.19s - 1028.19s |  I'm not sure what it is.
1028.19s - 1030.19s |  Maybe it's my browser.
1030.19s - 1032.19s |  I'll refresh my browser and see what happens.
1032.19s - 1034.19s |  All right.
1034.19s - 1037.56s |  So you guys can still hear me?
1037.56s - 1039.56s |  Yep.
1039.56s - 1045.47s |  I can.
1045.47s - 1047.47s |  The stream can.
1047.47s - 1049.47s |  Okay.
1049.67s - 1051.67s |  All right.
1051.67s - 1053.67s |  No, that's fine.
1053.67s - 1055.67s |  So my first jobs were customer facing.
1055.67s - 1057.67s |  Sitting on phone calls, helping people connect to the internet.
1059.67s - 1061.67s |  Pretty amazing jobs
1061.67s - 1063.67s |  because basically they teach you how to deal with people.
1063.67s - 1065.67s |  Especially like upset people.
1067.67s - 1069.67s |  How to
1069.67s - 1071.67s |  talk to them
1071.67s - 1073.67s |  so that you can both come out with
1073.67s - 1075.67s |  a solution that makes sense to both of you.
1075.67s - 1077.67s |  And also
1077.87s - 1079.87s |  the enjoyment that you get when helping
1079.87s - 1081.87s |  people out is something
1081.87s - 1083.87s |  that I still keep with me.
1085.87s - 1087.87s |  My next job was at an ISP.
1087.87s - 1089.87s |  So I was supposed to become
1089.87s - 1091.87s |  a sysadmin, but they offered the job
1091.87s - 1093.87s |  to two people. We both accepted it.
1093.87s - 1095.87s |  And he became the sysadmin.
1095.87s - 1097.87s |  I became everything else.
1097.87s - 1099.87s |  So I was doing IT.
1099.87s - 1101.87s |  Bit of sysadmin work.
1101.87s - 1103.87s |  Networking.
1103.87s - 1105.87s |  One thing that I had to
1106.07s - 1108.07s |  really do a lot of
1108.07s - 1110.07s |  during that time was read documentation.
1110.07s - 1112.07s |  Reading books.
1112.07s - 1114.07s |  Reading online.
1114.07s - 1116.07s |  Text files. Learning stuff
1116.07s - 1118.07s |  all the time.
1118.07s - 1120.07s |  And if anything
1122.07s - 1124.07s |  that's kind of
1124.07s - 1126.07s |  the most
1126.07s - 1128.07s |  kind of
1128.07s - 1130.07s |  important thing
1130.07s - 1132.07s |  or best piece of advice that I can give you.
1132.27s - 1134.27s |  At the time
1134.27s - 1136.27s |  I was learning
1136.27s - 1138.27s |  all the different
1138.27s - 1140.27s |  tools
1140.27s - 1142.27s |  little UNIX tools
1142.27s - 1144.27s |  and stuff. Something that I still keep
1144.27s - 1146.27s |  to this day.
1146.27s - 1148.27s |  The idea that UNIX is built out of
1148.27s - 1150.27s |  small tools
1150.27s - 1152.27s |  each with a single purpose.
1152.27s - 1154.27s |  You part them together to get
1154.27s - 1156.27s |  outcomes that are
1156.27s - 1158.27s |  maybe not the intended outcome originally
1158.27s - 1160.27s |  but that's the whole idea
1160.47s - 1162.47s |  of hacking
1162.47s - 1164.47s |  is to come up with something that may not be
1164.47s - 1166.47s |  exactly what you're expecting.
1166.47s - 1168.47s |  And then of course
1168.47s - 1170.47s |  once you get them working
1170.47s - 1172.47s |  you can script them, you can automate them
1172.47s - 1174.47s |  you can then go and look for
1174.47s - 1176.47s |  APIs or build them into APIs
1176.47s - 1178.47s |  etc.
1178.47s - 1180.47s |  etc.
1180.47s - 1182.47s |  Storing configuration
1182.47s - 1184.47s |  and it basically made my life at that time
1184.47s - 1186.47s |  a lot easier because
1186.47s - 1188.47s |  I took a lot of the repetitive workout
1188.67s - 1190.67s |  and that's something that
1190.67s - 1192.67s |  is still important
1192.67s - 1194.67s |  for me today.
1197.67s - 1199.67s |  Your question at this time
1199.67s - 1201.67s |  is probably
1201.67s - 1203.67s |  why GRC? Where does GRC come in?
1203.67s - 1205.67s |  So
1205.67s - 1207.67s |  we haven't got there yet.
1207.67s - 1209.67s |  GRC was not really a thing at this time
1209.67s - 1211.67s |  and
1211.67s - 1213.67s |  this is basically the prequel.
1213.67s - 1215.67s |  These are the threads
1215.67s - 1217.67s |  that will add together to become
1217.87s - 1219.87s |  how someone became
1219.87s - 1221.87s |  or how I became
1221.87s - 1223.87s |  a GRC person.
1223.87s - 1225.87s |  Back in those days
1225.87s - 1227.87s |  it was the wild west. You had antivirus
1227.87s - 1229.87s |  but most people switched it off
1229.87s - 1231.87s |  because it would slow your PC down.
1231.87s - 1233.87s |  Firewalls existed
1233.87s - 1235.87s |  but I remember
1235.87s - 1237.87s |  one day when Nuke came out
1237.87s - 1239.87s |  I was
1239.87s - 1241.87s |  on a phone call
1241.87s - 1243.87s |  and basically
1243.87s - 1245.87s |  the guy who I was chatting to
1246.07s - 1248.07s |  had won Nuke and
1248.07s - 1250.07s |  he tried it out on my PC
1250.07s - 1252.07s |  and managed to crash my PC
1252.07s - 1254.07s |  while I was trying to help him out.
1256.07s - 1258.07s |  What it turned out was our customer network
1258.07s - 1260.07s |  the actual modems
1260.07s - 1262.07s |  that connected out to our customers
1262.07s - 1264.07s |  was actually connected directly to our
1264.07s - 1266.07s |  corporate network. There was no firewall
1266.07s - 1268.07s |  in between them so they had full access
1268.07s - 1270.07s |  to be able to do whatever they needed
1270.07s - 1272.07s |  on our network.
1272.07s - 1274.07s |  And of course
1274.27s - 1276.27s |  our PCs were never patched
1276.27s - 1278.27s |  because no one patched in those days.
1278.27s - 1280.27s |  About this time
1282.27s - 1284.27s |  after this
1284.27s - 1286.27s |  some of the work that I was doing was creating
1286.27s - 1288.27s |  and deploying solutions
1288.27s - 1290.27s |  so networking Linux solutions
1290.27s - 1292.27s |  at the time our security team
1292.27s - 1294.27s |  which were basically two guys
1294.27s - 1296.27s |  that knew how to put firewalls together
1296.27s - 1298.27s |  left, gave no notice
1298.27s - 1300.27s |  they left on Friday and on the Tuesday
1300.27s - 1302.27s |  they were due to deploy a firewall
1302.47s - 1304.47s |  and they had not started any work on it.
1306.47s - 1308.47s |  And so what I
1308.47s - 1310.47s |  essentially had to do
1310.47s - 1312.47s |  was learn firewalls
1312.47s - 1314.47s |  in three days so I could deploy
1314.47s - 1316.47s |  the firewall at a client and pretend to be
1316.47s - 1318.47s |  the expert
1318.47s - 1320.47s |  so that weekend was spent
1320.47s - 1322.47s |  learning firewalls
1322.47s - 1324.47s |  and back then it wasn't
1324.47s - 1326.47s |  as easy as you think
1326.47s - 1328.47s |  it might be today
1328.47s - 1330.47s |  I had to get the right hardware
1330.67s - 1332.67s |  get the right operating system
1332.67s - 1334.67s |  Alan if you can hear us we lost your audio
1334.67s - 1336.67s |  and your screen
1336.67s - 1342.16s |  to your presentation
1342.16s - 1344.16s |  Am I still there?
1344.16s - 1346.16s |  You're back now
1346.16s - 1348.16s |  Thank you
1348.16s - 1350.16s |  And so back then
1350.16s - 1352.16s |  firewalls were not as easy
1352.16s - 1354.16s |  as you may
1354.16s - 1356.16s |  think they were
1356.16s - 1358.16s |  and they are today
1358.16s - 1360.16s |  you had to get the right hardware
1360.16s - 1362.16s |  so it wouldn't run on just any hardware
1362.36s - 1364.36s |  you had to get
1364.36s - 1366.36s |  an OS
1366.36s - 1368.36s |  and harden it
1368.36s - 1370.36s |  and set up
1370.36s - 1372.36s |  the networking and the software
1372.36s - 1374.36s |  you had to understand the networking
1374.36s - 1376.36s |  that you were doing
1376.36s - 1378.36s |  and I had three days to learn it
1378.36s - 1380.36s |  We lost you again Alan
1380.36s - 1385.17s |  I did that
1385.17s - 1387.17s |  It's really odd
1387.17s - 1389.17s |  it says he's talking but
1389.17s - 1391.17s |  we don't see or hear him
1391.17s - 1395.44s |  It's very odd
1395.64s - 1397.64s |  And right now you may be talking
1397.64s - 1399.64s |  over him X-Ray
1399.64s - 1406.92s |  I think it's a client case
1406.92s - 1408.92s |  He just disappeared
1408.92s - 1410.92s |  there's no slides and Alan's not there
1410.92s - 1422.52s |  Ok you're back now
1422.52s - 1424.52s |  For what it's worth Alan
1424.52s - 1426.52s |  I can hear you
1426.52s - 1428.52s |  the screen can hear you
1428.52s - 1430.52s |  so
1430.52s - 1432.52s |  the recording can hear you
1432.52s - 1434.52s |  Ok
1434.52s - 1436.52s |  alright now that's fine
1436.52s - 1445.82s |  alright so
1446.02s - 1448.02s |  I'm just going to push through I guess
1448.02s - 1450.02s |  so
1450.02s - 1455.19s |  yeah
1455.19s - 1457.19s |  this is the golden age of the firewall
1457.19s - 1459.19s |  you use basically
1459.19s - 1461.19s |  sandboxes or NT boxes each which cost
1461.19s - 1463.19s |  thousands of dollars
1463.19s - 1465.19s |  3EU rack mounted
1465.19s - 1467.19s |  servers, high availability
1467.19s - 1469.19s |  they manage NATs, your mail
1469.19s - 1471.19s |  your VPNs, web proxying
1471.19s - 1473.19s |  and
1473.19s - 1475.19s |  there were two trends that were happening
1475.19s - 1477.19s |  that were going
1477.39s - 1479.39s |  to basically make firewalls
1479.39s - 1481.39s |  less important
1481.39s - 1483.39s |  the Jericho group
1483.39s - 1485.39s |  came out with the analogy of chewy
1485.39s - 1487.39s |  mints
1487.39s - 1489.39s |  so the idea that you had a crunchy outside and chewy
1489.39s - 1491.39s |  inside was your network so your firewalls
1491.39s - 1493.39s |  were very strong and protective
1493.39s - 1495.39s |  but as soon as someone got inside your network
1495.39s - 1497.39s |  they could do whatever
1497.39s - 1499.39s |  they wanted and that's pretty much where
1499.39s - 1501.39s |  we are today
1501.39s - 1503.39s |  with the idea of
1503.39s - 1505.39s |  phishing
1505.59s - 1507.59s |  and trying to
1507.59s - 1509.59s |  get things on the inside
1509.59s - 1511.59s |  connecting out
1511.59s - 1513.59s |  on your own behalf
1513.59s - 1515.59s |  or on the attackers behalf
1515.59s - 1517.59s |  the other
1517.59s - 1519.59s |  thing that was happening was
1519.59s - 1521.59s |  everything became HTTP
1521.59s - 1523.59s |  so trying to block specific
1523.59s - 1525.59s |  services on a firewall
1525.59s - 1527.59s |  became quite pointless
1527.59s - 1529.59s |  and everything slowly became
1529.59s - 1531.59s |  encrypted
1531.59s - 1533.59s |  and so the firewall didn't
1533.79s - 1535.79s |  actually really see what the traffic was
1535.79s - 1537.79s |  and
1537.79s - 1539.79s |  now they become
1539.79s - 1541.79s |  they're still important but they're not everything
1541.79s - 1543.79s |  the other thing
1543.79s - 1545.79s |  that was happening at this time was
1545.79s - 1547.79s |  Microsoft were kind of in trouble
1547.79s - 1549.79s |  open source
1549.79s - 1551.79s |  was really good
1551.79s - 1553.79s |  the LAMP stack
1553.79s - 1555.79s |  so Linux, Apache, MySQL
1555.79s - 1557.79s |  and Perl is what everyone was
1557.79s - 1559.79s |  using, it was all free
1559.79s - 1561.79s |  software, it really worked very well
1561.99s - 1563.99s |  set and forget
1563.99s - 1565.99s |  and so that's
1565.99s - 1567.99s |  pretty much what it was all about
1567.99s - 1569.99s |  Microsoft were trying to push
1569.99s - 1571.99s |  the idea of Windows and IIS
1571.99s - 1573.99s |  but that wasn't
1573.99s - 1575.99s |  really working out for them
1575.99s - 1577.99s |  and one of the issues that they had
1577.99s - 1579.99s |  the biggest issue that they had
1579.99s - 1581.99s |  was the perception that
1581.99s - 1583.99s |  Windows was not
1583.99s - 1585.99s |  secure
1585.99s - 1587.99s |  you had
1587.99s - 1589.99s |  pretty much 5 minutes
1590.19s - 1592.19s |  to put an IIS server
1592.19s - 1594.19s |  on the internet before it would be taken over
1594.19s - 1596.19s |  and
1596.19s - 1598.19s |  this was around about 2001
1598.19s - 1600.19s |  the year of CodeRed and Nimda
1600.19s - 1602.19s |  which basically
1602.19s - 1604.19s |  were
1604.19s - 1606.19s |  you know
1606.19s - 1608.19s |  vulnerabilities
1608.19s - 1610.19s |  and attacks
1610.19s - 1612.19s |  that showed just how
1612.19s - 1614.19s |  bad the coding was behind
1614.19s - 1616.19s |  Windows and at this
1616.19s - 1618.19s |  time Bill Gates who was then the CEO
1618.39s - 1620.39s |  of Microsoft wrote a memo to say
1620.39s - 1622.39s |  security is important, we need to take it important
1622.39s - 1624.39s |  and
1624.39s - 1626.39s |  it is probably
1626.39s - 1628.39s |  one of the most important things that happened
1628.39s - 1630.39s |  in security, it established your patch
1630.39s - 1632.39s |  Tuesday, it got Microsoft involved
1632.39s - 1634.39s |  in the security world
1634.39s - 1636.39s |  accepting vulnerabilities, addressing
1636.39s - 1638.39s |  vulnerabilities
1638.39s - 1640.39s |  and of course
1640.39s - 1642.39s |  I'm not going to say Bill Gates was the guy
1642.39s - 1644.39s |  who did everything but the fact that
1644.39s - 1646.39s |  it came from the top established
1646.59s - 1648.59s |  that security was important
1648.59s - 1650.59s |  and there were
1650.59s - 1652.59s |  some very very smart people at Microsoft
1652.59s - 1654.59s |  that took security really seriously
1656.59s - 1658.59s |  their products started rolling out
1658.59s - 1660.59s |  with their features disabled or tools
1660.59s - 1662.59s |  that could be used to lock them down
1664.59s - 1666.59s |  and yeah I realise that I'm praising
1666.59s - 1668.59s |  a vendor at Defcon
1668.59s - 1670.59s |  and of all vendors I'm praising Microsoft
1670.59s - 1672.59s |  but you know
1672.59s - 1674.59s |  you can only imagine what the world would look like
1674.79s - 1676.79s |  if this
1676.79s - 1678.79s |  security had never happened
1680.79s - 1682.79s |  and
1682.79s - 1684.79s |  the thing is
1684.79s - 1686.79s |  IT departments will do the best
1686.79s - 1688.79s |  with what they have and usually
1688.79s - 1690.79s |  security is not something that
1690.79s - 1692.79s |  they're specifically looking out for
1692.79s - 1694.79s |  and the easier you can make their lives
1694.79s - 1696.79s |  the better
1696.79s - 1698.79s |  and being able to plan
1698.79s - 1700.79s |  their month around
1700.79s - 1702.79s |  the second Tuesday of the
1702.99s - 1704.99s |  month means
1704.99s - 1706.99s |  that they can
1706.99s - 1708.99s |  work out
1708.99s - 1710.99s |  when to actually deploy stuff
1710.99s - 1712.99s |  and do it around the rest
1712.99s - 1714.99s |  of everything and they can make
1714.99s - 1716.99s |  everything else work around
1716.99s - 1718.99s |  that
1718.99s - 1720.99s |  2003
1720.99s - 1722.99s |  which is kind of the end of
1722.99s - 1724.99s |  my first decade was
1724.99s - 1726.99s |  when the slammer
1726.99s - 1728.99s |  worm
1728.99s - 1730.99s |  was introduced
1731.19s - 1733.19s |  it was basically I think
1733.19s - 1735.19s |  the lowest of the low
1735.19s - 1737.19s |  in terms of
1737.19s - 1739.19s |  information security
1739.19s - 1741.19s |  it was basically a tiny
1741.19s - 1743.19s |  worm that
1743.19s - 1745.19s |  affected only
1745.19s - 1747.19s |  SQL servers and
1747.19s - 1749.19s |  75,000 servers were affected
1749.19s - 1751.19s |  on day one which is quite
1751.19s - 1753.19s |  a scary number because if you consider
1753.19s - 1755.19s |  the fact that the way it
1755.19s - 1757.19s |  propagates is from someone's SQL
1757.19s - 1759.19s |  server speaking to someone else's SQL
1759.39s - 1761.39s |  which why
1761.39s - 1763.39s |  would your SQL server ever need to speak
1763.39s - 1765.39s |  to another organization's SQL
1765.39s - 1767.39s |  server? It doesn't
1767.39s - 1769.39s |  and so it kind of showed us that
1769.39s - 1771.39s |  everything was broken
1771.39s - 1773.39s |  and there was a lot
1773.39s - 1775.39s |  of work that we needed to do
1775.39s - 1777.39s |  and firewalls
1777.39s - 1779.39s |  they weren't everything
1779.39s - 1781.39s |  and
1781.39s - 1783.39s |  especially if they were allowing
1783.39s - 1785.39s |  worms
1785.39s - 1787.39s |  through in the most
1787.59s - 1791.09s |  vulnerable manner
1791.09s - 1793.09s |  one of the things that I haven't
1793.09s - 1795.09s |  talked about is the I love you bug
1795.09s - 1797.09s |  a Trojan and that
1797.09s - 1799.09s |  pushed the world
1799.09s - 1801.09s |  towards hey you know what
1801.09s - 1803.09s |  if you want to get behind a firewall
1803.09s - 1805.09s |  Trojans are the way to do it
1805.09s - 1807.09s |  and
1807.09s - 1809.09s |  established phishing
1809.09s - 1811.09s |  as a viable
1811.09s - 1814.34s |  attack
1814.34s - 1816.34s |  and that is the first decade
1816.34s - 1818.34s |  so the second decade is
1818.54s - 1820.54s |  men in black
1820.54s - 1822.54s |  and this is where things get a little
1822.54s - 1824.54s |  bit boring financial auditors
1824.54s - 1826.54s |  started noticing that computers are
1826.54s - 1828.54s |  getting used more and more for storing
1828.54s - 1830.54s |  financial information
1832.54s - 1834.54s |  they want to audit them because it's the right thing
1834.54s - 1836.54s |  to do but also
1836.54s - 1838.54s |  of course because there's money to be made the big five
1838.54s - 1840.54s |  at this time were ready to get in on the action
1840.54s - 1842.54s |  and this
1842.54s - 1844.54s |  is where the ISF gets big
1844.54s - 1846.54s |  as well as ISACA
1846.74s - 1848.74s |  introduced the COVID controls
1848.74s - 1850.74s |  it was a bit of an awkward
1850.74s - 1852.74s |  time because it's two groups that
1852.74s - 1854.74s |  didn't really know each other very
1854.74s - 1856.74s |  well had very different
1856.74s - 1858.74s |  ways of working so you're
1858.74s - 1860.74s |  looking at your kind of traditional
1860.74s - 1862.74s |  auditors that come in
1862.74s - 1864.74s |  and expect that they've
1864.74s - 1866.74s |  got their list of things that they're looking at
1866.74s - 1868.74s |  and it should just work
1868.74s - 1870.74s |  you have your IT people
1870.74s - 1872.74s |  where it's basically
1872.74s - 1874.74s |  taping chaos to
1874.94s - 1876.94s |  more chaos and hoping
1876.94s - 1878.94s |  for the best and these are
1878.94s - 1880.94s |  just the two different groups that
1880.94s - 1882.94s |  don't
1882.94s - 1884.94s |  didn't really
1884.94s - 1886.94s |  work really well together
1886.94s - 1888.94s |  and then of course
1888.94s - 1890.94s |  in some cases if you had a security team
1890.94s - 1892.94s |  they would sit between them
1892.94s - 1894.94s |  and try and work it all out
1894.94s - 1896.94s |  ISACA at this time
1896.94s - 1898.94s |  introduced RISC
1898.94s - 1900.94s |  and
1900.94s - 1902.94s |  came up with
1903.14s - 1905.14s |  lofty ideas like ALEs
1905.14s - 1907.14s |  which is your annualised
1907.14s - 1909.14s |  loss expectancy
1909.14s - 1911.14s |  which is a nice idea and
1911.14s - 1913.14s |  would really be quite amazing
1913.14s - 1915.14s |  if it wasn't
1915.14s - 1917.14s |  totally and utterly impractical
1917.14s - 1919.14s |  which is where you
1919.14s - 1921.14s |  take the chance of something happening
1921.14s - 1923.14s |  which is your likelihood and work out
1923.14s - 1925.14s |  what the cost will be and work out
1925.14s - 1927.14s |  each year
1927.14s - 1929.14s |  what the chance of everything happening
1929.14s - 1931.14s |  is going to be and
1931.34s - 1933.34s |  that comes out with
1933.34s - 1935.34s |  exactly how much money you're expecting
1935.34s - 1937.34s |  to lose if you get hacked
1939.34s - 1941.34s |  and then of course what you'll do
1941.34s - 1943.34s |  is you'll just basically take that number
1943.34s - 1945.34s |  spend less than that and you've actually made some money
1945.34s - 1947.34s |  out of it
1947.34s - 1949.34s |  but it's basically I guess
1949.34s - 1951.34s |  times a guess
1951.34s - 1953.34s |  divided by how many years you expect
1953.34s - 1955.34s |  things should happen
1955.34s - 1957.34s |  and essentially
1957.34s - 1959.34s |  you're guessing numbers and once you're
1959.54s - 1961.54s |  guessing numbers you might as well just
1961.54s - 1963.54s |  use different ways of working
1963.54s - 1965.54s |  how much to spend
1965.54s - 1967.54s |  on security
1967.54s - 1969.54s |  they also at the same time
1969.54s - 1971.54s |  came out with COVID
1971.54s - 1973.54s |  and of course ways to manage it
1973.54s - 1975.54s |  and audit it which was your
1975.54s - 1977.54s |  c-censusm
1977.54s - 1979.54s |  and yeah
1979.54s - 1981.54s |  that's still about
1981.54s - 1983.54s |  ASARC is still going
1983.54s - 1985.54s |  and with their
1985.54s - 1987.54s |  c-censusm
1987.74s - 1989.74s |  also enter King George V
1989.74s - 1991.74s |  and Sir John Wolfe Barry
1991.74s - 1993.74s |  so John Wolfe Barry who designed the
1993.74s - 1995.74s |  London Bridge
1995.74s - 1997.74s |  he created an organisation
1997.74s - 1999.74s |  to create standards
1999.74s - 2001.74s |  which was called the BSI
2001.74s - 2003.74s |  King George V
2003.74s - 2005.74s |  gave it a royal charter
2005.74s - 2007.74s |  so basically hey
2007.74s - 2009.74s |  that's fine as the king
2009.74s - 2011.74s |  would like you to
2011.74s - 2013.74s |  make standards
2013.74s - 2015.74s |  so that's kind of how the BSI
2015.94s - 2017.94s |  started
2017.94s - 2019.94s |  one of the British standards
2019.94s - 2021.94s |  which they then created many many
2021.94s - 2023.94s |  years later was
2023.94s - 2025.94s |  British standard 7 7 9
2025.94s - 2027.94s |  which was the code of
2027.94s - 2029.94s |  practice for information security
2029.94s - 2031.94s |  management
2031.94s - 2033.94s |  and that essentially became
2033.94s - 2035.94s |  an international
2035.94s - 2037.94s |  standard after
2037.94s - 2039.94s |  a lot of companies adopted
2039.94s - 2041.94s |  it including South Africa
2041.94s - 2043.94s |  and
2044.14s - 2046.14s |  Australia
2046.14s - 2048.14s |  and then once it became the
2048.14s - 2050.14s |  international standards
2050.14s - 2052.14s |  it eventually got renumbered
2052.14s - 2054.14s |  to 27,000
2054.14s - 2056.14s |  and 2 not 1
2056.14s - 2058.14s |  so they tacked on
2058.14s - 2060.14s |  a part to it originally
2060.14s - 2062.14s |  and because
2062.14s - 2064.14s |  it was kind of like we have
2064.14s - 2066.14s |  these ways of doing stuff but
2066.14s - 2068.14s |  we don't have a process around it
2068.14s - 2070.14s |  can you quickly put a process together
2070.14s - 2072.14s |  so they tacked on a process
2072.34s - 2074.34s |  and that became 27,001
2074.34s - 2076.34s |  which is what we know
2076.34s - 2078.34s |  as ISO 27,001
2078.34s - 2080.34s |  today they also created
2080.34s - 2082.34s |  part 3 which is how to measure risk
2082.34s - 2084.34s |  and that
2084.34s - 2086.34s |  became 27,005 but
2086.34s - 2088.34s |  they've removed it because it's almost
2088.34s - 2090.34s |  identical to 31,000
2090.34s - 2092.34s |  and
2092.34s - 2094.34s |  yeah
2094.34s - 2096.34s |  no point in having two of them
2096.34s - 2098.34s |  one which is just very specific
2098.34s - 2102.77s |  to IT
2102.97s - 2104.97s |  So that's kind of what was happening
2104.97s - 2106.97s |  around that time
2106.97s - 2108.97s |  standards were getting
2108.97s - 2110.97s |  updated and important
2110.97s - 2112.97s |  people were starting to look at them
2112.97s - 2114.97s |  where was I? So I was doing
2114.97s - 2116.97s |  firewalls
2116.97s - 2118.97s |  but I'd also worked out how to manage
2118.97s - 2120.97s |  them, firewalls were becoming less
2120.97s - 2122.97s |  complex, easier to manage
2122.97s - 2124.97s |  my time, I had more time on my hands
2124.97s - 2126.97s |  so the company
2126.97s - 2128.97s |  I was working with
2128.97s - 2130.97s |  I said hey do you want some help
2131.17s - 2133.17s |  figuring out how to speak to the
2133.17s - 2135.17s |  auditors
2135.17s - 2137.17s |  and they were quite keen on that
2137.17s - 2139.17s |  because I had some IT knowledge
2139.17s - 2141.17s |  and so
2141.17s - 2143.17s |  I started
2143.17s - 2145.17s |  working with the IT team
2145.17s - 2147.17s |  to get some stats behind
2147.17s - 2149.17s |  what they were doing
2149.17s - 2151.17s |  and then realising how much
2151.17s - 2153.17s |  work there was we put some plans
2153.17s - 2155.17s |  together to get things
2155.17s - 2157.17s |  working better
2157.17s - 2159.17s |  and then at the same time
2159.37s - 2161.37s |  getting interested in policies
2161.37s - 2163.37s |  and standards and put a few of those together
2163.37s - 2165.37s |  and
2165.37s - 2167.37s |  once that had happened
2167.37s - 2169.37s |  started working with what was
2169.37s - 2171.37s |  the ISO
2171.37s - 2173.37s |  17799
2173.37s - 2175.37s |  which was kind of halfway between
2175.37s - 2177.37s |  7799 and
2177.37s - 2179.37s |  27002
2179.37s - 2181.37s |  and then
2181.37s - 2183.37s |  things exploded
2183.37s - 2185.37s |  I started doing
2185.37s - 2187.37s |  pretty much all the security work
2187.57s - 2189.57s |  and more and more
2189.57s - 2191.57s |  security work was
2191.57s - 2193.57s |  or more and more work was actually starting
2193.57s - 2195.57s |  to move into the security
2195.57s - 2197.57s |  department
2197.57s - 2199.57s |  so I was
2199.57s - 2201.57s |  running around
2201.57s - 2203.57s |  I was monitoring and fixing
2203.57s - 2205.57s |  monitoring and fixing
2205.57s - 2207.57s |  how the patching was working
2207.57s - 2209.57s |  and improving antivirus making sure
2209.57s - 2211.57s |  that
2211.57s - 2213.57s |  users couldn't switch off their
2213.57s - 2215.57s |  antivirus, finding
2215.77s - 2217.77s |  where all the different laptops were
2217.77s - 2219.77s |  that weren't running antivirus and getting
2219.77s - 2221.77s |  it installed
2221.77s - 2223.77s |  fixing the user management process
2223.77s - 2225.77s |  doing risk assessments against
2225.77s - 2227.77s |  projects, vulnerability scans
2227.77s - 2229.77s |  and then
2229.77s - 2231.77s |  tying that back to the
2231.77s - 2233.77s |  patching
2233.77s - 2235.77s |  I was doing pen tests
2235.77s - 2237.77s |  light pen tests
2237.77s - 2239.77s |  and then arranging
2239.77s - 2241.77s |  more thorough pen tests
2241.77s - 2243.77s |  with our pen testers
2243.97s - 2245.97s |  I was still managing
2245.97s - 2247.97s |  the firewalls
2247.97s - 2249.97s |  doing cab meetings, managing audits
2249.97s - 2251.97s |  watching logs
2251.97s - 2253.97s |  and investigating incidents
2253.97s - 2255.97s |  I was eyes and glass, basically myself
2255.97s - 2257.97s |  I was the SOC
2257.97s - 2259.97s |  arrange data
2259.97s - 2261.97s |  for the risk team
2261.97s - 2263.97s |  doing strategy
2263.97s - 2265.97s |  and also
2265.97s - 2267.97s |  proof of concepts
2267.97s - 2269.97s |  I was trying to roll out DLP and NAC
2269.97s - 2271.97s |  also at the same time
2272.17s - 2274.17s |  editing the policies and standards
2274.17s - 2276.17s |  and the procedures, I was doing awareness
2276.17s - 2278.17s |  including the induction, I was managing
2278.17s - 2280.17s |  my budget, I was presenting to the CFO
2280.17s - 2282.17s |  on a monthly basis, the CEO
2282.17s - 2284.17s |  quarterly and then the board annually
2284.17s - 2286.17s |  and then
2286.17s - 2288.17s |  in my spare time I was doing a blog
2288.17s - 2290.17s |  and keeping up to date with the people who were blogging
2290.17s - 2292.17s |  at the time
2292.17s - 2294.17s |  the people that are really really smart
2294.17s - 2296.17s |  and I still keep in touch with them
2296.17s - 2298.17s |  because they are still driving
2298.17s - 2300.17s |  everything around the industry
2302.17s - 2304.17s |  and at the same time I was slowly starting to become
2304.17s - 2306.17s |  a speaker
2306.17s - 2308.17s |  and that was probably
2308.17s - 2310.17s |  the best thing I ever did
2310.17s - 2312.17s |  I absolutely love speaking, it's my favourite hobby
2312.17s - 2314.17s |  it gives me
2314.17s - 2316.17s |  access to the most amazing
2316.17s - 2318.17s |  people and it usually goes off quite
2318.17s - 2320.17s |  nicely, except sometimes you do have
2320.17s - 2322.17s |  technical difficulties
2324.17s - 2326.17s |  and that was kind of where I
2326.17s - 2328.17s |  ended up in my second decade
2328.17s - 2330.17s |  pretty much doing everything all the time
2330.37s - 2332.37s |  and
2332.37s - 2334.37s |  as an island
2334.37s - 2336.37s |  and then
2336.37s - 2338.37s |  to celebrate
2338.37s - 2340.37s |  I decided, let's
2340.37s - 2342.37s |  have a change of pace
2342.37s - 2344.37s |  so I packed up my family and moved us from
2344.37s - 2346.37s |  South Africa to a desert island
2346.37s - 2348.37s |  and g'day
2348.37s - 2350.37s |  welcome to Australia mate
2350.37s - 2352.37s |  is where I ended up
2352.37s - 2354.37s |  so here I am in Melbourne
2354.37s - 2356.37s |  and I think this
2356.37s - 2358.37s |  kind of ended
2358.57s - 2360.57s |  my second decade
2360.57s - 2362.57s |  and kind of is where
2362.57s - 2364.57s |  security just became too big
2364.57s - 2366.57s |  as I said
2366.57s - 2368.57s |  there was a lot I was doing
2368.57s - 2370.57s |  and up to this point I could do it all
2370.57s - 2372.57s |  but I wasn't doing
2372.57s - 2374.57s |  a great job
2374.57s - 2376.57s |  of all the different pieces
2376.57s - 2378.57s |  I was doing enough
2378.57s - 2380.57s |  and so I think at this point
2380.57s - 2382.57s |  is when the ideas of
2382.57s - 2384.57s |  code review and pen testing
2384.57s - 2386.57s |  and user management and policy management
2386.77s - 2388.77s |  and awareness and stuff
2388.77s - 2390.77s |  they all became specialisations of their own
2392.77s - 2394.77s |  and it was becoming impossible
2394.77s - 2396.77s |  for me to keep up
2396.77s - 2398.77s |  with all of them
2398.77s - 2400.77s |  even though I was trying as hard
2400.77s - 2402.77s |  as I possibly could
2402.77s - 2404.77s |  and the one question
2404.77s - 2406.77s |  that all the
2406.77s - 2408.77s |  employment agencies were asking
2408.77s - 2410.77s |  me at the time because
2410.77s - 2412.77s |  now I'd moved to a new country
2412.77s - 2414.77s |  no one knew me
2414.97s - 2416.97s |  well known in South Africa
2416.97s - 2418.97s |  because I was very involved in the community
2418.97s - 2420.97s |  but in Australia no one knew me
2420.97s - 2422.97s |  at all and the one question
2422.97s - 2424.97s |  that I kept getting asked was
2424.97s - 2426.97s |  what is your speciality
2428.97s - 2430.97s |  and I had no speciality
2430.97s - 2432.97s |  I did everything
2432.97s - 2434.97s |  I was interested in everything
2434.97s - 2436.97s |  I wanted to do everything
2436.97s - 2438.97s |  and so basically
2438.97s - 2440.97s |  that's what I told them
2440.97s - 2442.97s |  and I didn't really get very much
2443.17s - 2445.17s |  they believed me that
2445.17s - 2447.17s |  I was doing everything
2447.17s - 2449.17s |  so essentially I was like
2449.17s - 2451.17s |  well you know what
2451.17s - 2453.17s |  probably GRC or the management
2453.17s - 2455.17s |  of the policies and the management
2455.17s - 2457.17s |  of the processes
2459.17s - 2461.17s |  is pretty much where I am at the moment
2461.17s - 2463.17s |  and that's
2463.17s - 2465.17s |  where I got
2465.17s - 2467.17s |  well that's
2467.17s - 2469.17s |  what I got involved with
2469.17s - 2471.17s |  once I hit Australia
2475.16s - 2477.16s |  as an aside
2477.16s - 2479.16s |  at this time
2479.16s - 2481.16s |  2013 was when the big Target
2481.16s - 2483.16s |  happened
2483.16s - 2485.16s |  so Target got attacked
2485.16s - 2487.16s |  and
2487.16s - 2489.16s |  had 40 million
2489.16s - 2491.16s |  credit cards stolen
2491.16s - 2493.16s |  and
2493.16s - 2495.16s |  basically Target had to pay just
2495.16s - 2497.16s |  short of 20 million dollars
2497.16s - 2499.16s |  of fines for that
2499.16s - 2501.16s |  it happened through a third party
2501.16s - 2503.16s |  even though they had firewalls
2503.36s - 2505.36s |  in place they were totally ineffective
2507.36s - 2509.36s |  and that's when PCI DSS became
2509.36s - 2511.36s |  quite important because
2511.36s - 2513.36s |  organisations
2513.36s - 2515.36s |  were like well we are not paying 20 million
2515.36s - 2517.36s |  dollars
2517.36s - 2519.36s |  in case we get hacked
2519.36s - 2521.36s |  what can we do
2521.36s - 2523.36s |  and the credit card industry
2523.36s - 2525.36s |  were like here's what you can do
2525.36s - 2527.36s |  and so
2527.36s - 2529.36s |  that's when PCI became
2529.36s - 2531.36s |  the kind of
2531.56s - 2533.56s |  standard that everyone was looking at
2533.56s - 2535.56s |  I absolutely love it
2535.56s - 2537.56s |  it's the standard that I work the most
2537.56s - 2539.56s |  with
2539.56s - 2541.56s |  it's my favourite because
2541.56s - 2543.56s |  it's not
2543.56s - 2545.56s |  it's not kind of a framework
2545.56s - 2547.56s |  it's actually specific
2547.56s - 2549.56s |  specific controls
2549.56s - 2551.56s |  it tells you what you need to do
2551.56s - 2553.56s |  and because it's created by
2553.56s - 2555.56s |  an organisation that
2555.56s - 2557.56s |  has skin in the
2557.56s - 2559.56s |  game it's done really
2559.76s - 2561.76s |  well
2561.76s - 2569.36s |  and yeah
2569.36s - 2571.36s |  people talk about the tail wagging the dog
2571.36s - 2573.36s |  and how compliance should just
2573.36s - 2575.36s |  security should just happen
2575.36s - 2577.36s |  and compliance should just be there
2577.36s - 2579.36s |  to say hey this is what we're doing
2579.36s - 2581.36s |  it's a nice idea
2581.36s - 2583.36s |  but every organisation
2583.36s - 2585.36s |  I work with
2585.36s - 2587.36s |  don't really meet even the basic requirements
2587.36s - 2589.36s |  of PCI which
2589.36s - 2591.36s |  in some cases are really really basic
2591.36s - 2593.36s |  and
2593.56s - 2595.56s |  I think yeah
2595.56s - 2597.56s |  so in terms of GRC I think
2597.56s - 2599.56s |  we've got a bit of a way to go
2599.56s - 2601.56s |  and hopefully
2601.56s - 2603.56s |  yeah my talk
2603.56s - 2605.56s |  has given you a bit of an understanding
2605.56s - 2607.56s |  as to how
2607.56s - 2609.56s |  we got here
2609.56s - 2611.56s |  how did we actually get to
2611.56s - 2613.56s |  where we are right now
2613.56s - 2615.56s |  and
2615.56s - 2617.56s |  some of the things that I hope
2617.56s - 2619.56s |  you picked up
2619.56s - 2621.56s |  we are making it up as we go along
2621.76s - 2623.76s |  there's no real experts
2623.76s - 2625.76s |  in terms of security
2625.76s - 2627.76s |  we've been around for 30 years
2627.76s - 2629.76s |  but in terms of GRC it's been around for
2629.76s - 2631.76s |  a while but mainly
2631.76s - 2633.76s |  just really the last 10 years
2633.76s - 2635.76s |  which is pretty much nothing
2635.76s - 2637.76s |  if you really think about
2637.76s - 2639.76s |  how long
2639.76s - 2641.76s |  other industries have been around for
2641.76s - 2643.76s |  community
2643.76s - 2645.76s |  community
2645.76s - 2647.76s |  is important
2647.76s - 2649.76s |  find your people
2649.96s - 2651.96s |  work with them
2651.96s - 2653.96s |  yeah
2653.96s - 2655.96s |  if you're working in security
2655.96s - 2657.96s |  make sure you're
2657.96s - 2659.96s |  improving, it's always going to be chaotic
2659.96s - 2661.96s |  but as long as you get the small improvements
2661.96s - 2663.96s |  over time you will see the results
2665.96s - 2667.96s |  and people, it's all about people
2667.96s - 2669.96s |  people have helped me out over time
2669.96s - 2671.96s |  I've had some good managers, some good bosses
2671.96s - 2673.96s |  and a lot of people that have helped me
2673.96s - 2675.96s |  to get where I am today
2675.96s - 2677.96s |  and I'm very grateful about that
2678.16s - 2680.16s |  and also I try to give back
2680.16s - 2682.16s |  and so should you
2682.16s - 2684.16s |  get involved, do presentations
2684.16s - 2686.16s |  write a blog, tweet
2686.16s - 2688.16s |  go on to LinkedIn
2688.16s - 2690.16s |  read, learn
2690.16s - 2692.16s |  improve yourself
2692.16s - 2694.16s |  improve
2694.16s - 2696.16s |  your world
2696.16s - 2698.16s |  and hopefully that's that
2698.16s - 2700.16s |  and yeah
2700.16s - 2702.16s |  are there any questions
2702.16s - 2704.16s |  I'm going to try
2704.16s - 2706.16s |  to get back to everybody
2706.36s - 2708.36s |  so everyone can see me
2708.36s - 2718.20s |  and see if there's any questions
2718.20s - 2720.20s |  any questions for our speaker
2720.20s - 2728.88s |  the last
2728.88s - 2730.88s |  time I did a talk on GRC
2730.88s - 2732.88s |  I did an entire presentation of like
2732.88s - 2734.88s |  30 minutes long and then eventually
2734.88s - 2736.88s |  the first question was
2736.88s - 2738.88s |  what is GRC
2738.88s - 2740.88s |  so GRC
2740.88s - 2742.88s |  generally is Governance, Risk and Compliance
2742.88s - 2744.88s |  and
2744.88s - 2746.88s |  it's just a term for the
2746.88s - 2748.88s |  management at a high level
2749.08s - 2751.08s |  of what security does
2751.08s - 2753.08s |  and
2753.08s - 2755.08s |  a way to let other organizations
2755.08s - 2757.08s |  know exactly what it is that
2757.08s - 2759.08s |  you're doing as well as for
2759.08s - 2761.08s |  organizations to be able to discuss
2761.08s - 2763.08s |  amongst each other
2763.08s - 2765.08s |  what the expectation is
2765.08s - 2767.08s |  so
2767.08s - 2769.08s |  I'll ask the first question and answer it
2769.08s - 2771.08s |  are there any other questions
2771.08s - 2773.08s |  I have a question
2773.08s - 2775.08s |  what type of person
2775.08s - 2777.08s |  what kind of personality do you think
2777.28s - 2779.28s |  turns to GRC over
2779.28s - 2781.28s |  say like
2781.28s - 2783.28s |  I know I'm interested in
2783.28s - 2785.28s |  diving deep into something
2785.28s - 2787.28s |  finding vulnerabilities and everything
2787.28s - 2789.28s |  so how would you describe the average
2789.28s - 2791.28s |  GRC enthusiast
2791.28s - 2793.28s |  that's
2793.28s - 2795.28s |  a really good question
2795.28s - 2797.28s |  the stream is gone again
2797.28s - 2799.28s |  ok
2799.28s - 2803.30s |  so
2803.30s - 2805.30s |  that's a really good question
2805.30s - 2807.30s |  I
2807.50s - 2809.50s |  as I said earlier
2809.50s - 2811.50s |  the kind of men in black idea
2811.50s - 2813.50s |  where you have auditors coming in
2813.50s - 2815.50s |  and they're financial auditors and stuff
2815.50s - 2817.50s |  I think that's how it used to be
2817.50s - 2819.50s |  I work
2819.50s - 2821.50s |  with a team
2821.50s - 2823.50s |  of GRC specialists
2823.50s - 2825.50s |  and we are all individually
2825.50s - 2827.50s |  very very different people
2829.50s - 2831.50s |  the idea
2831.50s - 2833.50s |  that
2833.50s - 2835.50s |  it's very similar to
2835.70s - 2837.70s |  financial auditing I think is how
2837.70s - 2839.70s |  it used to be
2839.70s - 2841.70s |  I think it's changed
2841.70s - 2843.70s |  and now you're starting
2843.70s - 2845.70s |  to look at people who are
2845.70s - 2847.70s |  very much almost like the hacker
2847.70s - 2849.70s |  mentality where it's kind of
2849.70s - 2851.70s |  a case of
2853.70s - 2855.70s |  people that are
2855.70s - 2857.70s |  interested in a specific topic
2857.70s - 2859.70s |  and want to dig as deep as they possibly
2859.70s - 2861.70s |  can into it
2861.70s - 2863.70s |  people that are
2863.90s - 2865.90s |  let's try and build something
2865.90s - 2867.90s |  that makes sense
2867.90s - 2869.90s |  you have to be someone
2869.90s - 2871.90s |  who can
2871.90s - 2873.90s |  communicate nicely
2873.90s - 2875.90s |  you have to be someone that
2875.90s - 2877.90s |  is able to
2877.90s - 2879.90s |  sit and read
2879.90s - 2881.90s |  documentation or write
2881.90s - 2883.90s |  documentation
2883.90s - 2885.90s |  and someone who
2885.90s - 2887.90s |  looks for patterns
2887.90s - 2889.90s |  someone's telling you something and you're not quite sure
2889.90s - 2891.90s |  whether it makes sense or not
2892.10s - 2894.10s |  but
2894.10s - 2896.10s |  quite honestly
2896.10s - 2898.10s |  the answer to that really is
2898.10s - 2900.10s |  there are a lot of different
2900.10s - 2902.10s |  people in GRC
2904.10s - 2906.10s |  some
2906.10s - 2908.10s |  of us are technical
2908.10s - 2910.10s |  but
2910.10s - 2912.10s |  some of us are not as technical
2912.10s - 2914.10s |  are more
2914.10s - 2916.10s |  at peace talking to people
2916.10s - 2918.10s |  and understanding how things
2918.10s - 2920.10s |  work by actually doing interviews
2920.30s - 2922.30s |  and some people
2922.30s - 2924.30s |  are very good with reading through
2924.30s - 2926.30s |  documentation, finding issues
2926.30s - 2928.30s |  and working through those
2928.30s - 2930.30s |  so yeah
2930.30s - 2932.30s |  that's a really good question
2932.30s - 2934.30s |  the answer is
2934.30s - 2936.30s |  because I'm
2936.30s - 2938.30s |  a consultant
2938.30s - 2940.30s |  I'll give you the standard consultant answer
2940.30s - 2946.88s |  it depends
2946.88s - 2948.88s |  I'm just messing up with the answer on YouTube
2948.88s - 2958.75s |  ok
2958.75s - 2968.11s |  are there any other questions?
2968.31s - 2970.31s |  we may have figured out what was causing the problem
2970.31s - 2972.31s |  apparently your slides are still
2972.31s - 2974.31s |  being shown in the green room
2974.31s - 2976.31s |  and so it might have caused
2976.31s - 2978.31s |  a little confusion for a frame
2978.31s - 2983.35s |  ah ok
2983.35s - 2985.35s |  ok thanks a lot now I heard it all
2985.35s - 2987.35s |  ok
2987.35s - 2991.56s |  who knows
2991.56s - 2993.56s |  I guess there's different types everywhere
2993.56s - 2995.56s |  but I wanted to get
2995.56s - 2997.56s |  what's the core values
2997.56s - 2999.56s |  that drive someone to GRC essentially
2999.56s - 3001.56s |  look cool
3001.76s - 3003.76s |  that's a very interesting answer
3003.76s - 3005.76s |  yeah ok so core values
3005.76s - 3007.76s |  probably I think GRC
3007.76s - 3009.76s |  more than
3009.76s - 3011.76s |  any other part
3011.76s - 3013.76s |  of information security
3013.76s - 3015.76s |  in my talk basically
3015.76s - 3017.76s |  I said hey listen
3017.76s - 3019.76s |  until about 10 years ago
3019.76s - 3021.76s |  information security was one big
3021.76s - 3023.76s |  thing and
3023.76s - 3025.76s |  now there's all the different specializations
3025.76s - 3027.76s |  and they're kind of working out what they are
3027.76s - 3029.76s |  and where they should fit
3029.96s - 3031.96s |  GRC is the biggest
3031.96s - 3033.96s |  it's the one that covers the most ground
3033.96s - 3035.96s |  and so
3035.96s - 3037.96s |  if you're someone
3037.96s - 3039.96s |  who's interested in everything
3039.96s - 3041.96s |  and likes to see how everything fits
3041.96s - 3043.96s |  together
3043.96s - 3045.96s |  that's probably
3045.96s - 3047.96s |  where you'll find
3047.96s - 3049.96s |  that you'll be most interested
3049.96s - 3051.96s |  in GRC
3051.96s - 3053.96s |  because
3053.96s - 3055.96s |  you'll understand
3055.96s - 3057.96s |  how everything fits together
3058.16s - 3060.16s |  from that kind of
3060.16s - 3062.16s |  high level view as opposed to
3062.16s - 3064.16s |  digging deep into
3064.16s - 3066.16s |  incident response
3066.16s - 3068.16s |  learning how
3068.16s - 3070.16s |  things work at a
3070.16s - 3072.16s |  packet level or whatever
3072.16s - 3074.16s |  or hacking
3074.16s - 3076.16s |  into
3076.16s - 3078.16s |  windows boxes or
3078.16s - 3080.16s |  learning how AD works or whatever
3080.16s - 3082.16s |  GRC is
3082.16s - 3084.16s |  more of a
3084.16s - 3086.16s |  is more
3086.36s - 3088.36s |  how long for the excellent presentation
3088.36s - 3090.36s |  oh I'm sorry you're still here
3090.36s - 3092.36s |  I'm still here yeah
3092.36s - 3094.36s |  it's all good
3094.36s - 3096.36s |  but yeah
3096.36s - 3098.36s |  thank you very much for having me
3098.36s - 3100.36s |  and yeah
3100.36s - 3102.36s |  I'll kind of be around for a little bit
3102.36s - 3104.36s |  so if anyone does have any more questions
3104.36s - 3106.36s |  yeah you can come speak to me
3106.36s - 3108.36s |  hopefully I'll be able to answer you
3108.36s - 3110.36s |  yeah no I heard the answer
3110.36s - 3112.36s |  now it kind of made me think like
3112.36s - 3114.36s |  of
3114.56s - 3116.56s |  in the old Chinese wars they had like
3116.56s - 3118.56s |  the war strategist moving the soldiers around
3118.56s - 3120.56s |  on the battlefield just thinking of you
3120.56s - 3122.56s |  so that's the impression I got
3122.56s - 3124.56s |  after your answer
3124.56s - 3126.56s |  yeah
3126.56s - 3128.56s |  yeah
3128.56s - 3130.56s |  well
3130.56s - 3132.56s |  thanks a lot
3132.56s - 3136.86s |  I was curious
3136.86s - 3138.86s |  what you think will be
3138.86s - 3140.86s |  occurring with AI
3140.86s - 3142.86s |  do you see
3142.86s - 3144.86s |  a lot of movement in your
3145.06s - 3160.69s |  department
3160.69s - 3162.69s |  sorry someone asked you a question but you were not in the audio zone
3162.69s - 3164.69s |  Alan so
3164.69s - 3166.69s |  yeah no I didn't get the question
3166.69s - 3168.69s |  I think it was Bobby that was talking
3168.69s - 3172.90s |  yes
3172.90s - 3174.90s |  yes I was wondering
3174.90s - 3176.90s |  how you think things are going to change
3176.90s - 3178.90s |  in the future for your position
3178.90s - 3180.90s |  when it comes to AI
3180.90s - 3182.90s |  what do you see in the future
3182.90s - 3184.90s |  when it comes to regulations
3184.90s - 3186.90s |  and things we should do
3186.90s - 3188.90s |  with the modernization
3189.10s - 3191.10s |  yeah good question
3191.10s - 3193.10s |  so there's a few things there
3193.10s - 3195.10s |  so
3195.10s - 3197.10s |  you know
3197.10s - 3199.10s |  there's multiple things that we need to look at
3199.10s - 3201.10s |  so number one will it change how we do
3201.10s - 3203.10s |  work probably
3203.10s - 3205.10s |  because a lot of
3205.10s - 3207.10s |  as I said
3207.10s - 3209.10s |  a lot of the work that we do is going through documentation
3209.10s - 3211.10s |  especially if you're
3211.10s - 3213.10s |  an assessor so you know has this
3213.10s - 3215.10s |  organization been able to meet
3215.10s - 3217.10s |  what they say that they do
3217.30s - 3219.30s |  what do they say they do
3219.30s - 3221.30s |  AI can very
3221.30s - 3223.30s |  definitely help you out with that
3223.30s - 3225.30s |  damn it
3225.30s - 3227.30s |  and
3227.30s - 3229.30s |  also in terms of
3229.30s - 3231.30s |  sharing of data
3231.30s - 3233.30s |  sharing of information
3233.30s - 3235.30s |  we need to be very clear about
3235.30s - 3237.30s |  how we're going to share and how we
3237.30s - 3239.30s |  you know
3239.30s - 3241.30s |  what
3241.30s - 3243.30s |  kind of information is okay to share
3243.30s - 3245.30s |  and how that's going to work
3245.50s - 3247.50s |  so we already
3247.50s - 3249.50s |  at our organization have
3249.50s - 3251.50s |  an AI policy of
3251.50s - 3253.50s |  how we can share information
3253.50s - 3255.50s |  which in most cases is like
3255.50s - 3257.50s |  no
3257.50s - 3259.50s |  and it was pretty much the same
3259.50s - 3261.50s |  as when cloud came out
3261.50s - 3263.50s |  the answer was no we're not interested in cloud
3263.50s - 3265.50s |  but over time
3265.50s - 3267.50s |  as the controls get stronger
3267.50s - 3269.50s |  you might be able to use
3269.50s - 3271.50s |  AI more and more
3271.50s - 3273.50s |  to do your work
3273.70s - 3275.70s |  and then of course how does the
3275.70s - 3277.70s |  rest of the organization use AI
3277.70s - 3279.70s |  and
3279.70s - 3281.70s |  I think
3281.70s - 3283.70s |  I think at the moment
3283.70s - 3285.70s |  the answer is it's
3285.70s - 3287.70s |  going to be important it looks like
3287.70s - 3289.70s |  it's going to be a very useful tool
3289.70s - 3291.70s |  and for us to
3291.70s - 3293.70s |  just say blankly no you
3293.70s - 3295.70s |  can't is not going to be
3295.70s - 3297.70s |  it's not going to be useful
3297.70s - 3299.70s |  so the question is
3299.70s - 3301.70s |  we just have to keep an eye
3301.90s - 3303.90s |  on how it's
3303.90s - 3305.90s |  working and
3305.90s - 3307.90s |  get an understanding of the different
3307.90s - 3309.90s |  controls and get an understanding
3309.90s - 3311.90s |  of well at least be able to
3311.90s - 3313.90s |  say hey you know what you can use it
3313.90s - 3315.90s |  but here's what our expectations are
3315.90s - 3317.90s |  I don't think we're
3317.90s - 3319.90s |  there quite yet
3319.90s - 3321.90s |  but I think we're getting there
3321.90s - 3323.90s |  I think we have a good idea of what we want
3323.90s - 3325.90s |  at a very very high level
3325.90s - 3327.90s |  and now it's just a case of working
3327.90s - 3329.90s |  out
3329.90s - 3331.90s |  the details of what we want to see
3331.90s - 3339.40s |  I hope that answers the question
3339.40s - 3341.40s |  thank you I appreciate that
3341.40s - 3356.36s |  alright I'm going to take
3356.36s - 3358.36s |  myself off whatever
3358.36s - 3360.36s |  megaphone and yeah if there's
3360.36s - 3362.36s |  anyone that does want to
3362.36s - 3364.36s |  ask me questions or want to chat I'm around
