 All right, let's get started. We're running a little late. So
2.20s - 5.84s |  I'm going to try not to talk too fast. But I got to make up
5.84s - 10.56s |  some time here. So welcome to s bombs the hard way for my
10.56s - 14.74s |  adventures in hacking Bob the Minion. I am a product security
14.74s - 18.32s |  research and analysis director and services team lead at a fun
18.32s - 22.48s |  company called finite state. And we do all sorts of fun stuff
22.48s - 25.74s |  with s bombs, and a whole bunch of other stuff. But I'm not here
25.74s - 28.56s |  to talk to you about our product or any of that I'm talking about
28.56s - 36.14s |  my adventure with Bob. Alright, so who am I? I am a reformed
36.14s - 39.74s |  penetration tester and reformed crossed out. I left doing
39.74s - 43.38s |  penetration testing to go do some thought leadership and some
43.38s - 47.42s |  other hardware hacking and IoT bunch of stuff. And three months
47.42s - 49.86s |  into the job, my boss came to me and said, Hey, we have a customer
49.86s - 52.06s |  that wants to throw a lot of money at us to do pen tests. Can
52.06s - 55.94s |  you do it? Are you signing my paycheck? Yes, I can do that. So
55.94s - 58.80s |  I am a reformed penetration tester back doing penetration
58.80s - 65.16s |  testing back in OT ICS, IoT, and lots of hardware. I'm also the
65.16s - 69.04s |  co host of Paul's security weekly. We're in our 19th year
69.04s - 73.44s |  soon to go into our 20th year of a weekly security podcast. How
73.44s - 74.40s |  many of your listeners
76.64s - 80.68s |  go listen? Right? Awesome. Thank you. I do a lot of work with
80.68s - 85.82s |  sans. I'm both an instructor, and a course author around
86.02s - 90.18s |  wireless hacking, and IoT hacking irony, the ironically,
90.62s - 94.10s |  I'm a recent convert to the Oxford comma, because commas
94.10s - 98.22s |  save lives, folks. Okay. And someone said, Why are you been
98.22s - 100.38s |  using that Oxford comma for a really long time? So you're
100.38s - 103.34s |  really not a recent convert. So but I'm going to keep it. So
103.34s - 107.26s |  I'll add that. I also enjoy long walks on the beach, weighed down
107.26s - 110.76s |  by my ham radio. Yeah, I'm prepping for the zombie
110.76s - 115.08s |  apocalypse. Okay. All right. So let's get into some fun, fun
115.08s - 119.56s |  bits here. So we're gonna hack Bob the minion. So on every one
119.56s - 126.44s |  of my slides, except this one, features AI generated art with
126.44s - 130.42s |  minions. So let's get into character a little bit here. And
130.42s - 135.94s |  I took this image of my headshot and fed fed it to mid journey so
135.94s - 142.68s |  that I could become an evil, despicable me villain. So here
142.68s - 147.04s |  we go. This is some of this art is terrifying. And I kept the
147.04s - 151.08s |  ones that were insane, just because insanity. I didn't know
151.08s - 156.48s |  yesterday that there was an AI generated art competition. My I
156.48s - 160.20s |  would have been good at that, maybe. So I had lots of fun. I
160.20s - 163.92s |  think I put more time into the art than the actual words on
164.18s - 166.46s |  on these slides. Don't get me wrong, this, I think the
166.46s - 168.36s |  presentation is really good. You're gonna get something from
168.36s - 173.22s |  it. Alright, so a little bit of background. I work for company,
173.22s - 176.90s |  we do s bombs and a whole bunch of other stuff. But I really
176.90s - 181.02s |  think that s bombs are fun. And that was sort of my end goal was
181.02s - 185.42s |  to get a software bill of materials for Bob the minion. So
185.58s - 189.50s |  a little bit of background. A software bill of materials is an
189.50s - 192.50s |  inventory of all your software, their versions and who wrote it
192.50s - 196.88s |  where it came from, as part of your product security, sorry,
196.88s - 200.28s |  your software supply chain, and can help you do some security.
200.30s - 204.84s |  And we're going to start seeing somewhere around 2025, that
204.86s - 208.44s |  every product that connected product that you buy, either at
208.44s - 211.24s |  your company or for your personal consumption, will have
211.24s - 214.76s |  an s bomb associated with it, and will be available as part of
214.76s - 217.34s |  some of its certification process and being able to be
217.34s - 221.28s |  sold into the marketplace. Specifically, addressing some
221.28s - 224.66s |  of those here in the United States are executive order 14
224.66s - 229.02s |  208. For a lot of stuff going into government and into
229.02s - 235.26s |  consumer stuff. 524 B for the FDA. So any medical device that
235.26s - 239.70s |  is being submitted to the FDA for use on humans requires that
239.70s - 242.78s |  an s bomb is part of their submission process and a plan
242.78s - 245.18s |  for securing their devices over time and managing
245.18s - 249.90s |  vulnerabilities. And a voluntary program managed by the FCC here
249.90s - 252.96s |  in the US, the cyber Trustmark program, it's kind of like a
252.96s - 257.12s |  consumer protection thing so that as a voluntary program,
257.80s - 261.80s |  that companies can submit their devices to the cyber Trustmark
261.80s - 265.60s |  program, they can get a stamp on the box, and that a consumer can
265.60s - 268.40s |  have a high degree of confidence that there is some security in
268.40s - 271.04s |  this product baked in, and that they are monitoring for
271.04s - 274.76s |  vulnerabilities over time and issuing some updates with a
274.76s - 276.88s |  little barcode that links to a website that gives them an
276.88s - 279.88s |  overall security store score. So while you're standing at best
279.88s - 283.18s |  by, you can scan this barcode and go, Oh, this router has got
283.18s - 286.94s |  a three for security, and that one's got a nine, nine being
286.94s - 291.46s |  better. Yeah, I'm going to buy the one that's a nine. Cool. The
291.46s - 294.88s |  one that is absolutely both fascinating and terrifying, in
294.88s - 300.10s |  my opinion, is the EU Cyber Resiliency Act, or the EU CRA.
301.54s - 306.62s |  EU CRA, their intent in the EU is that they do not want any
306.64s - 309.16s |  connected products being sold into the marketplace that has
309.16s - 313.60s |  any vulnerabilities. And they also need to have a process for
313.60s - 317.02s |  managing vulnerabilities and patching and monitoring and all
317.02s - 319.70s |  this type of stuff and an S bomb will be included as part of that
319.70s - 323.70s |  process. And they are significantly more stringent and
323.70s - 327.52s |  this is not a voluntary program. It's mandatory if you want to
327.52s - 331.02s |  sell into Europe, and companies that sell into the US also sell
331.02s - 334.90s |  into Europe, same device. So many manufacturers are going to
334.90s - 339.48s |  have to submit to your CRA, which means everywhere on the
339.48s - 343.66s |  planet will largely benefit from those regulations. Okay, overall
343.66s - 347.88s |  some general benefits outside of any of the regulatory stuff for
347.88s - 351.12s |  software bill materials. They give us that software inventory
351.12s - 355.04s |  list for both both first and third party stuff that you're
355.04s - 358.04s |  developing and stuff that you've pulled in as part of your
358.04s - 361.18s |  development process and even into potential final firmware
361.18s - 363.60s |  that you're delivering to your customers or you are consuming.
364.38s - 367.50s |  With that list of those components and their versions,
367.50s - 371.82s |  you can perform some enrichment on those, find out whether there
371.82s - 374.02s |  are vulnerabilities associated with those products so that you
374.02s - 378.78s |  can then attempt to perform some risk mitigation and observe that
378.78s - 382.42s |  some of that risk exists and take appropriate actions. And
382.42s - 386.54s |  I'll also argue that you should be operationalizing your S bombs
386.58s - 389.46s |  as either a consumer or manufacturer, that you should
389.46s - 392.74s |  take the software bill of materials and use them as part
392.74s - 395.84s |  of your security process and your penetration testing
395.84s - 399.64s |  process. Because knowing the components may give you an
399.64s - 403.12s |  opportunity to improve that security knowing that their
403.12s - 406.08s |  vulnerabilities exist. And that was the subject of my talk that
406.08s - 410.48s |  I did at RSA entitled S bombs for evil. So you can go check
410.48s - 414.36s |  that out as well. So we won't go too far into that. So as part of
414.36s - 418.80s |  my day job, and as part of being a reformed unreformed
418.80s - 423.42s |  penetration tester, I really love software bill of materials.
423.46s - 427.38s |  And some of the fun stuff that I get to do at work is go find
427.38s - 433.62s |  some random device, get the firmware and bacon, get an S
433.62s - 436.46s |  bomb for it, just to see what they're see if we can do some
436.46s - 439.22s |  accurate detection helps build build some of the things that
439.22s - 441.84s |  we're detecting for helps improve our product. And quite
441.84s - 444.86s |  honestly, I think it's really fun and find all sorts of sort
444.86s - 448.26s |  of scary things. So getting that firmware doing some
448.26s - 452.40s |  extraction, verifying that the extraction is accurate for our
452.40s - 455.08s |  product, figuring out all new things going back and
455.08s - 459.36s |  reinverse engineering some binaries to figure out the type
459.36s - 463.48s |  of code and the code vulnerables. And as a result of
463.48s - 465.64s |  that S bomb being able to discover that there's a product
465.64s - 468.80s |  with a firmware that has some known vulnerabilities and known
468.80s - 473.20s |  is here in air quotes, and that it's known to the community that
473.20s - 476.08s |  these components have vulnerabilities, but maybe as a
476.08s - 479.22s |  consumer, or maybe even as a manufacturer, you may not
479.22s - 481.30s |  realize that these components have vulnerabilities, and
481.30s - 485.08s |  they're using them in your, your products. So occasionally, we
485.08s - 489.16s |  get to find some some oday and some other occasional hackery
489.42s - 492.50s |  and discovering some surprises. And we may have some surprises
492.50s - 497.08s |  here with Bob Dominion. And arguably, it might not be all
497.08s - 501.02s |  that surprising. After all, ultimately, I think the end
501.02s - 503.30s |  result is so much fun, and arguably, I get to come talk to
503.56s - 509.84s |  about it at DEF CON. So finding all of those weird products,
510.24s - 516.68s |  suddenly, a wild Bob appears. And yes, AI generated Bob in a
516.68s - 520.52s |  dystopian future, and hasn't shaved in a little bit. He
520.52s - 522.98s |  might look a little bit like me, I'm kind of disturbed about
522.98s - 528.12s |  that. So suddenly, a wild Bob appears. So what is this Bob?
529.02s - 535.06s |  This Bob is a wireless home router, the DavoLink AX1800. And
535.06s - 539.50s |  it has been licensed by Universal for DavoLink to
539.50s - 543.62s |  produce these wireless routers that are in the shape of Bob.
544.20s - 548.06s |  It's a nice plastic fun looking case around a wireless router
548.06s - 551.74s |  for your home. That's like, that's pretty cool. Pretty darn
551.74s - 557.76s |  good features for the price. Bob has Wi Fi six has some easy
557.76s - 562.32s |  mesh support and supports WPA3. So some of our latest Wi Fi
562.32s - 567.06s |  standards for for your home. Now, I've been doing some
567.08s - 570.18s |  hardware hacking around consumer routers for a really, really
570.18s - 574.78s |  long time. And it was typical that we were seeing devices with
574.78s - 577.34s |  flash and RAM of somewhere between four and eight megs,
577.38s - 581.90s |  maybe 16. Yeah, we've come a long way. This particular one
581.90s - 589.56s |  has, according to the box, and Amazon 128 megs of flash and 256
589.56s - 593.40s |  megs of RAM. That's pretty darn robust and compared to some of
593.40s - 597.64s |  the stuff that I've seen in the past. But it gets better. It's
597.64s - 600.80s |  not 128 megs of flash. We'll see that in a little bit here.
601.72s - 604.76s |  Currently, there's no open word support. So it is their own
604.76s - 608.60s |  custom firmware, big thumbs down from Mick down front here. And
608.60s - 612.70s |  they run about $70 on Amazon. So I didn't feel too bad about
612.70s - 615.54s |  buying one of these things and ripping Bob's head off to see
615.54s - 620.90s |  what was inside. I did not purchase the Kevin variety, the
620.90s - 625.18s |  Kevin variety is a little bit taller. And one of the upgrades
625.18s - 628.62s |  there is it does have Wi Fi 6E. So into the six gigahertz range,
628.94s - 631.94s |  but they're about double the price. And well, this is coming
631.94s - 635.26s |  out of my own personal budget. So I went for the cheap one,
635.48s - 638.26s |  right? I figured that many of the challenges will probably be
638.28s - 643.60s |  the same here. Alright, so, hey, I want firmware, right for
643.60s - 648.28s |  these devices. So I can generate some as moms. Let's go get the
648.28s - 652.78s |  firmware. But you tip my hat a little bit here. What firmware?
653.92s - 657.92s |  All right. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to easily locate
657.92s - 663.44s |  firmware for the devil link. x 1800. We powered the device up
663.46s - 667.56s |  used it figured out what all the interface was about logged in,
667.56s - 669.62s |  take a look at the web interface. And sure enough, in
669.62s - 671.70s |  the web interface, there is a button that says check for
671.70s - 675.58s |  updates. And as of two weeks ago, when I press the check for
675.58s - 680.64s |  updates button, there were no updates. There is one version of
680.64s - 683.06s |  firmware for this device, the one that came on it from the
683.06s - 686.86s |  factory, which will be terrifying when we see this a
686.86s - 690.82s |  little bit later. So there's one version firmware, it is what it
690.82s - 693.70s |  is, there's no updates, which means if I click the update
693.70s - 696.62s |  button, there's no firmware, which means I can't capture
696.62s - 700.58s |  anything off the wire. They can't get anything via web
700.58s - 703.40s |  inspection or TCP dump or any of that type of stuff to try to
703.40s - 708.36s |  recover the firmware from network traffic. Oh, well, I'll
708.36s - 712.12s |  go to the website. Nope, nothing on their website, you go to
712.12s - 715.40s |  their support forums, you go to their support pages, absolutely
715.40s - 718.76s |  no firmware for the x 1800. Available for download, there's
718.76s - 723.80s |  manuals and stuff. But no firmware. So what happens if I
723.80s - 727.02s |  brick it by accident, I'd have no way to upload firmware to
727.02s - 729.42s |  this because the manufacturer doesn't even make it available.
730.18s - 732.86s |  I checked the support forums to see if I could find links
732.86s - 737.30s |  somewhere in the support forums. And that was a mess. It's
737.46s - 740.66s |  dabbling as a Korean company, they have two different support
740.66s - 745.82s |  forums. One is in Korean, one is in English. The English has a
745.82s - 749.50s |  little bit more population to it. In that more folks have
749.50s - 753.74s |  asked some questions. The Korean version of the support forums
754.18s - 758.30s |  there's like three posts, and that's it. Clearly Korea was not
758.30s - 762.50s |  their intended market for these devices. And Google Translate
762.50s - 765.54s |  had a really easy time trying to go through and translate that
765.54s - 768.68s |  stuff because there wasn't a wasn't a lot there. search
768.68s - 772.34s |  through all of the support forum posts, there are no links to
772.34s - 774.78s |  firmware, there's nobody even asking, Hey, I bricked my
774.78s - 778.34s |  router, can I get a copy of the firmware, so that I could reach
778.34s - 781.66s |  out to them and try to ask them for it or try that same guys.
782.64s - 785.88s |  And no, so nobody was asking and nobody was offering.
787.04s - 789.92s |  Unfortunately, now that means with no ready access to the
789.92s - 794.76s |  firmware, we've got to go do this the hard way. And no access
794.76s - 799.00s |  ready access to firmware that mean no wrong way that means no,
799.20s - 802.56s |  no s bomb, no enrichment, no ability for me to figure out if
802.56s - 805.24s |  there are vulnerabilities in this really easily based on
805.24s - 809.36s |  software components and so forth. So but no s bombs means
810.06s - 814.90s |  no fun. Right? I love some of this stuff. I really want I
814.90s - 819.26s |  tried to make this image like the dystopian future dark gray.
819.54s - 824.78s |  And the training for the AI models at majority was not
824.78s - 827.46s |  picking up that I wanted this to be dirty and gritty no matter how
827.46s - 831.38s |  many times I told it and it came out really happy and bright and
831.38s - 835.26s |  green and very cartoony for all these dogs. No, I wanted like,
835.68s - 840.00s |  like wolves that we're gonna tear Bob's head off. And now
840.60s - 844.86s |  there's some nice puppies here. So I did the best I could. All
844.86s - 848.72s |  right. But so if we can't get ready access to it, we got to go
848.72s - 851.76s |  about this do this hard way. And while brain surgery is fun,
851.76s - 857.04s |  right? Yeah, just ask buckaroo bonsai adventures of buckaroo
857.04s - 861.06s |  bonsai in the eighth dimension. This was how some of this AI
861.06s - 864.80s |  prompt ended up I told mid journey that I wanted Bob the
864.80s - 869.14s |  minion to go undergo brain surgery by buckaroo bonsai. Have
869.14s - 872.66s |  the surgeon be buckaroo bonsai. Unfortunately, it actually
872.66s - 877.70s |  crossed Peter Weller with a minion and came up with this
877.70s - 883.46s |  abomination. It's quite amazing. Like this is the best of them.
883.70s - 887.66s |  The other ones were just downright terrible. Also, if
887.66s - 891.34s |  you've never seen buckaroo, the adventures of buckaroo bonsai in
891.34s - 894.26s |  the eighth dimension, I highly recommend that you do so it is a
894.26s - 899.40s |  1980s very campy film with some really amazing stars. Peter
899.40s - 903.16s |  Weller, john Lithgow, a whole host of folks. And it's, it's
903.16s - 906.52s |  amazingly campy. And maybe one for Jeff Moss to send a hacker
906.52s - 911.48s |  movie night, because it's it's hilarious. And it's great. It's
911.48s - 914.54s |  on the what the top 1000 movies you should see before you die.
914.60s - 920.84s |  And like number 43. In some of the the campy sci fi movies, top
920.84s - 925.94s |  lists and so forth. So my plug and and note that Bob doesn't
925.94s - 928.94s |  even have yellow ears in this one. They're apparently Peter
928.94s - 932.14s |  Weller's ears. Not only did they do a brain transplant, they did
932.14s - 935.46s |  an ear transplant too. Alright, so let's get to this brain
935.46s - 939.86s |  surgery. Alright, take this thing apart. We do this the
939.86s - 943.22s |  hard way. Pull the boards out, do an inventory, take pictures
943.22s - 946.82s |  of all the chips. Let's do some some analysis and figure out
947.32s - 951.16s |  some of the spec sheets, go download those and then start
951.16s - 954.56s |  figuring out how we can get access to that firmware. Are
954.56s - 957.32s |  there serial ports available on the board? Yes, yes. In this
957.32s - 961.84s |  case, there is I did not go that route. However, can we use JTAG
961.84s - 966.84s |  or SWD to dump firmware from from the device from that bus? I
966.84s - 969.60s |  fortunately did not have to go down that road either because
969.60s - 975.62s |  that is arguably the harder. But what about SPI? And being able
975.62s - 979.72s |  to grab that from there? The first question was looking at
979.72s - 986.00s |  the processor. It's an RTL8198D featured here in this slide. And
986.00s - 989.48s |  I figured I was probably going to have to go use JTAG have the
989.48s - 991.88s |  processor with internal memory and have to dump it from
991.88s - 996.74s |  internal memory and so forth, but not so much. But what I did
996.74s - 1006.68s |  find on the board was a Winbond W25N01GV, which is a three volt
1007.06s - 1016.06s |  one gigabit flash chip. But they said 128 meg. No one gigabit
1016.20s - 1019.32s |  available on this board and they're only using 128 megabit
1019.36s - 1022.18s |  according to what they're saying. Yeah, so there's a lot
1022.18s - 1026.12s |  more room on this. Yeah, why? I don't know. Because they're
1026.12s - 1029.38s |  cheap, honestly. Ask me how I know this. We'll see this in a
1029.38s - 1036.58s |  little bit here. So SPI and it is NAND. So alright, this will
1036.58s - 1040.34s |  be interesting. And apparently Bob is really hungry for some
1040.34s - 1045.46s |  chips. Alright, so I had to go now get this flash off of this
1045.46s - 1049.04s |  Winbond SPI flash chip. And there was very much of
1049.04s - 1054.54s |  progression of frustration going through this. So this is what
1054.54s - 1057.60s |  society thinks I do when I remove firmware from a chip.
1057.96s - 1064.38s |  Credit to Wired and IBM here, sorry, Intel, in some of their
1064.38s - 1066.44s |  photographs about doing some really great work with a
1066.44s - 1069.44s |  microscope and all sorts of fun stuff. And you'll note, I'm sort
1069.44s - 1072.28s |  of featured down here in the right hand corner, looking very
1072.28s - 1075.54s |  studious and doing a really great job of removing firmware
1075.54s - 1080.08s |  and what society thinks I do. This is what my friends think I
1080.08s - 1086.02s |  do using the PC bytes. And I'm starting to look a lot worse and
1086.02s - 1089.22s |  maybe a little bit nerdier and geekier. And yes, this is my
1089.26s - 1092.38s |  disaster of a desk and home office. And you get to see also
1092.38s - 1095.34s |  the other fun stuff in the background. So this is what my
1095.34s - 1099.46s |  friends think I do. Right, Mick? Yeah. All right. This is what I
1099.46s - 1103.42s |  think I do. This is also one of my attempts, soldering wires
1103.42s - 1106.62s |  directly to the flash chip and then holding it down with some
1106.62s - 1114.04s |  tape. This didn't work either. Okay. So I'm getting worse and
1114.04s - 1118.64s |  worse in my, my studiousness here. And ultimately, this is
1118.64s - 1123.72s |  what I really did. I now look like a really big goober. And I
1123.72s - 1126.20s |  actually had to remove the chip from the board and put it in
1126.20s - 1131.88s |  like a $3 adapter from Amazon and use some, some DuPont wires
1131.88s - 1136.74s |  and attach it to a Raspberry Pi. And use that IO on the board
1136.74s - 1140.88s |  for the Raspberry Pi. Yeah, and just reuse the PC bytes thing to
1140.88s - 1143.58s |  hold my Raspberry Pi because I was too lazy to take it off my
1143.58s - 1147.22s |  desk. So yeah, I actually had to do take the chip off of the
1147.22s - 1149.64s |  board because I couldn't get any of the other stuff to work
1149.64s - 1152.46s |  right. And it may not have been the fact that there was anything
1152.46s - 1157.06s |  wrong with my PC bytes or with my solder job. But I do know
1157.06s - 1161.98s |  that I bricked the one that I did the solder job to. No longer
1161.98s - 1167.16s |  functions. And we'll see why that maybe it wasn't actually the
1167.16s - 1170.40s |  PC bytes or my solder job that wasn't allowing me to get access
1170.40s - 1170.92s |  to the stuff.
1171.28s - 1171.76s |  Out of time.
1172.08s - 1176.92s |  Out of time? Oh, I see. I thought I had an hour. Okay, I
1176.92s - 1180.36s |  will I'll get out of your head here. What's up? I'm going to do
1180.36s - 1184.00s |  these slides real quick here what I really did. Not a lot of
1184.00s - 1188.14s |  flash ROM support, found some stuff, got a dump, found some
1188.14s - 1192.50s |  treasure, lots of exploits, lots of exploit intelligence, lots of
1192.50s - 1197.30s |  remote code vulnerabilities, passwords, username Bob,
1197.30s - 1200.94s |  password, Bob, other stuff in Korean language, some key
1200.94s - 1204.86s |  material, a horrible web app that they wrote their own web
1204.86s - 1207.86s |  server with some possible command injection via the
1207.86s - 1212.22s |  password reset function, a bunch of scripts going to IP in China.
1214.18s - 1216.62s |  All sorts of other fun stuff. And I really want to do the
1216.62s - 1220.22s |  brain transplant to fix the one that I broke. And I've had no
1220.22s - 1223.18s |  luck. I spent a week on the struggle bus with that. Because
1223.22s - 1226.74s |  the NAND support that I needed has no right support. So coming
1226.74s - 1232.18s |  soon. Alright, I'm out of here. I'm gonna if you want to catch
1232.18s - 1235.06s |  me in the back or over in the IT village, I'm happy to do some
1235.06s - 1238.18s |  more. But I want to say thank you and a big thank you to my
1238.18s - 1241.78s |  co worker Edwin Shuttleworth, who is all now so now a minion
1241.78s - 1244.60s |  as well. So thank you very much and apologies for taking an
1244.60s - 1247.68s |  extra moment of your time. And I'll see you over at the IoT
1247.68s - 1249.68s |  village will be right up front here. If you've got any
1249.68s - 1251.60s |  questions, and you want to see some more of these slides and
