**QuickShare Overview**
- **QuickShare**: Google's file transfer solution for Android, similar to Apple's AirDrop.
- Formerly known as Nearby Share, expanded to Windows as a pre-installed app with PC manufacturers like LG.
- Uses multiple communication methods: WebRTC, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, Wi-Fi Direct, Wi-Fi hotspot.

**Research Objective and Approach**
- **Objective**: Investigate QuickShare for vulnerabilities, aiming for remote code execution (RCE).
- **Initial Research**: Focused on understanding QuickShare's protocol using Protobuf, building tools to analyze communication packets.
- **Tool Development**: Created a DLL to log packets and used fuzzing techniques with WinAFL and Protobuf mutator for Windows.

**Vulnerabilities and Exploits**
- Discovered 10 vulnerabilities in Windows and Android, including file transfer without approval and Wi-Fi redirection.
- Developed an **RCE attack chain** using five combined vulnerabilities.
- **File Acceptance Bypass**: Ability to send files without approval.
- **Wi-Fi Connection Exploit**: Forced connection to rogue Wi-Fi, enabling a man-in-the-middle attack.

**RCE Attack Chain Details**
- **Vulnerabilities Utilized**: File creation in downloads folder, Wi-Fi network connection, QuickShare crashes, and endless loop timeout.
- **Execution Strategy**: Overwriting executable files downloaded by browsers using metadata analysis of HTTPS sessions.

**Google's Response and Security Implications**
- Reported vulnerabilities to Google, which issued two CVEs addressing Wi-Fi connection persistence and file approval bypass.
- Emphasized importance of addressing minor security issues as they can lead to greater risks if left unchecked.

**Conclusion and Takeaways**
- **Key Takeaway**: Even basic abilities can be transformed into powerful capabilities through creative exploitation.
- Encourages broader security evaluation beyond specific programming mistakes, considering logical and behavioral risks.
