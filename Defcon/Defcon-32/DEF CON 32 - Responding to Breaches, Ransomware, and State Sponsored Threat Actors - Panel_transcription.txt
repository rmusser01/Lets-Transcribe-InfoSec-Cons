  "title": "DEF CON 32 - Responding to Breaches, Ransomware, and State Sponsored Threat Actors - Panel",
  "description": "For the past few years, we have had multiple instances of sophisticated cyber attacks ranging from ransomware attacks to attacks propagated by state sponsored threat actors; targeting elections, organizations, critical infrastructure etc. Organizations have had to step up and compensate with additional security controls and resources. We are living in a phase where even the most secure organizations are not immune to targeted cyber threats, the landscape of cyber security is in the state of constant evolution, with everybody playing to catch up.\n\nThis panel has been structured to delve into the complex and evolving nature of cyber adversaries. Beginning with an overview of recent cyber-attacks, breaches, and targeted ransomware incidents. We will also examine the rising wave of state sponsored threat actors, while focusing on their sophisticated adversary tactics, techniques and procedures.\n\nThis panel will focus on why organizations with even the most advanced cyber defense tooling and more than capable resources are still affected by breaches and threat actors. Our panel of experts will discuss the reasons behind these incidents and provide Insights into effective response and contentment strategies. Conversation will explore the critical components of how efficiently respond to threats, contain, and remediate them.\n\nAdditionally, the panel will also touch upon how threat intel assisted adversarial attack simulation, offensive cyber security operations could be used as proactive measures in enhancing an organization\u2019s defense posture, offering valuable insights into the mindset and methodologies of potential attackers.",

 Hey, everyone.
1.48s - 3.16s |  Good morning.
3.16s - 5.24s |  Morning, DEF CON.
5.24s - 6.84s |  Good morning.
6.84s - 7.84s |  Just come on.
7.84s - 11.84s |  I flew like 20 hours from India to Las Vegas.
11.84s - 12.64s |  Come on.
12.64s - 15.73s |  Good morning, DEF CON.
15.73s - 17.49s |  Now we got it.
17.49s - 19.69s |  So we have an amazing panel here.
19.69s - 23.25s |  My name is Abhijit Babirajan Renuga.
23.25s - 24.85s |  I know how that sounds.
24.85s - 26.81s |  So I call myself ABX.
26.81s - 29.41s |  Much, much shorter so that the people will not
29.41s - 31.57s |  be ruining my night, right?
31.57s - 33.21s |  So I used to be called many things,
33.21s - 36.53s |  but ABX is kind of very, very simple.
36.53s - 37.65s |  I manage.
37.65s - 40.77s |  I lead the advocacy village at DEF CON for the past,
40.77s - 42.85s |  like, 45 years, right?
42.85s - 44.37s |  So we are all there.
44.37s - 46.41s |  After this panel, maybe you can come there,
46.41s - 48.61s |  listen to the talks, workshops, all this amazing stuff
48.61s - 50.17s |  happening in there.
50.17s - 53.73s |  And I'm handing over the mic to the amazing panel here.
53.73s - 56.09s |  They will introduce themselves, and we
56.09s - 61.12s |  can start insulting each other.
61.12s - 62.00s |  I'll go.
62.00s - 64.60s |  I'm what's-his-face Adam Pennington.
64.60s - 67.64s |  I'm with a nonprofit called the MITRE Corporation,
67.64s - 71.16s |  where I run a cybersecurity framework called MITRE ATT&CK.
71.16s - 73.88s |  I've been with MITRE a long, long time at this point.
73.88s - 75.52s |  I helped gather a lot of the data
75.52s - 76.92s |  that we used to originally create
76.92s - 81.12s |  ATT&CK through a series of honeypots with state actors.
81.12s - 86.15s |  And so I've been watching this space for a pretty long time.
86.15s - 87.99s |  Hi, I'm Stryker.
87.99s - 90.83s |  I am the head of security communications and planning
90.83s - 91.75s |  and SCP.
91.75s - 95.47s |  And yes, that acronym was on purpose.
95.47s - 97.07s |  With the Adversary Pursuit Group,
97.07s - 99.59s |  that's the Threat Intel and Threat Research Unit
99.59s - 101.47s |  within Blackpoint Cyber.
101.47s - 103.63s |  We're an MDR, which means that we actually
103.63s - 108.71s |  get a lot of information from both the feedback.
108.71s - 111.43s |  We get a lot of information from both end user environments,
111.43s - 114.71s |  from a wide range of clients, from health care
114.71s - 116.83s |  and critical infrastructure, all the way
116.83s - 119.23s |  through your service-based industries,
119.23s - 121.51s |  and your local mom-and-pop shop.
121.51s - 124.75s |  And so we get both the supply chain moments
124.75s - 128.31s |  of them attacking directly the MSPs and then our end clients,
128.31s - 130.95s |  which leads to some really interesting research
130.95s - 132.87s |  and intel that our teams have been working on.
132.87s - 134.63s |  So looking forward to sharing that.
134.63s - 137.51s |  Oh, also, if you're going to pitch the Adversary Village,
137.51s - 140.35s |  come visit later at the Lonely Hackers Club.
140.35s - 141.15s |  I am an admin.
141.15s - 142.39s |  It's lots of fun.
142.39s - 143.63s |  And then the XR Village.
143.63s - 150.33s |  So.
150.33s - 152.37s |  What's up?
152.45s - 155.37s |  I'm the guy that can't work a microphone.
155.37s - 156.09s |  My name's Ken.
156.09s - 159.17s |  I'm the VP of AI for Omni Federal.
159.17s - 161.81s |  Previous to that role, I was a White House Presidential
161.81s - 163.29s |  Innovation Fellow for four years,
163.29s - 166.57s |  where I got to see some pretty interesting fun attacks.
166.57s - 168.21s |  And I'm looking forward to sharing
168.21s - 172.05s |  some of those experiences with you all today.
172.05s - 172.97s |  Hi, everyone.
172.97s - 174.45s |  I'm Nikhil Mittal.
174.45s - 176.05s |  I'm the founder of Altered Security.
176.05s - 179.37s |  We are a small organization that train people
179.37s - 182.45s |  in red teaming, on-prem, Azure, et cetera.
182.45s - 185.25s |  So we expect some stuff on Microsoft from me.
185.25s - 188.85s |  I'm pretty interested in that.
188.85s - 191.21s |  Now that the introductions are over,
191.21s - 193.85s |  I'm going to start from the right end with Adam.
193.85s - 196.09s |  So like I mentioned, the panel topic
196.09s - 199.37s |  is about the formidable adversaries and threat actor.
199.37s - 203.45s |  So I think Adam has a long experience on identifying
203.45s - 207.57s |  and putting these threat actors in the light.
207.57s - 211.89s |  So ATT&CK tracks publicly available threat intelligence
211.89s - 214.85s |  information on lots of different adversary groups.
214.85s - 218.09s |  And we've been doing that since our creation back in 2013
218.09s - 218.97s |  to 2015.
218.97s - 220.93s |  And so everything I'm going to be talking about
220.93s - 223.17s |  is coming from publicly available open source
223.17s - 225.01s |  intelligence sources.
225.01s - 228.05s |  But state hackers are not a new thing.
228.05s - 230.01s |  We've known about it for a long time.
230.01s - 231.61s |  It's been going on for a while.
231.61s - 233.97s |  It's been in the public eye for a pretty long time
234.21s - 238.09s |  back to the cuckoo's nest in the 80s, which
238.09s - 242.13s |  might have had a role in, not a terrific one.
242.13s - 245.37s |  And so it's been something that has been out there.
245.37s - 248.93s |  We saw a lot more awareness coming with the APT1 report
248.93s - 252.21s |  and then Russian hacking with the elections.
252.21s - 254.17s |  And so we've seen a lot of these waves,
254.17s - 256.25s |  North Korean ransomware.
256.25s - 259.29s |  And more recently, we've seen a lot of activity
259.29s - 261.73s |  where China has become prevalent again,
261.77s - 264.37s |  where we're seeing sophisticated activity happening
264.37s - 269.37s |  across a lot of organizations, some successful activity.
269.37s - 272.37s |  And so we're seeing trends in a lot of these spaces.
272.37s - 275.17s |  I flinch a little bit at the word sophisticated.
275.17s - 277.25s |  I know it was in the panel description,
277.25s - 281.81s |  but most threat actors are exactly as sophisticated
281.81s - 284.37s |  as they need to be in a given situation.
284.37s - 287.97s |  If they're any good, they're not usually pulling out
287.97s - 290.81s |  sort of the big guns unless they have to.
290.81s - 293.73s |  But in places where we've been seeing the defenses
293.73s - 296.93s |  get a lot better, people are watching their networks,
296.93s - 298.89s |  people watching their end systems,
298.89s - 301.45s |  and it's gotten a lot harder to work your way
301.45s - 302.81s |  through a network.
302.81s - 305.77s |  Those of you who are red teamers probably know this too,
305.77s - 307.53s |  that the space has gotten harder.
307.53s - 311.01s |  And so we've seen adversaries who are interested
311.01s - 313.93s |  in not getting caught and sometimes ransomware,
313.93s - 317.57s |  not so much, but a state actor that wants to steal
317.57s - 322.25s |  information and be in a network for months or years
322.25s - 325.73s |  needs to not get caught or not get completely caught
325.73s - 328.29s |  in order to meet their goals.
328.29s - 331.29s |  And so we're seeing a more and more of a trend
331.29s - 335.05s |  of adversaries getting into places that we don't watch.
335.89s - 337.73s |  And so it's a natural place to be.
337.73s - 340.81s |  It's nothing that we didn't know was possible.
340.81s - 343.45s |  It's not incredibly surprising,
343.45s - 345.41s |  but adversaries getting into routers.
345.45s - 348.21s |  We saw a lot of reporting on routers last year
348.21s - 350.09s |  and system security devices.
350.09s - 353.01s |  So finding a lot of zero days in the devices
353.01s - 355.49s |  that we actually bought to protect our networks,
355.49s - 358.53s |  getting into those and using those as pivot points
358.53s - 362.69s |  has been a popular trend to get into VMware ESX servers.
362.69s - 366.93s |  So getting into places where we can't run an ADR,
366.93s - 370.01s |  they're not supported, we don't know how to see there.
370.01s - 372.85s |  And so you're more and more buried into the system.
372.85s - 375.01s |  We've also seen a trend lately with adversaries
375.61s - 376.85s |  getting into security cameras.
376.85s - 381.01s |  And so crappy Linux devices that we have no security on
381.01s - 383.33s |  have no way of adding security to.
383.33s - 385.53s |  And so we're gonna have to be looking at some other places
385.53s - 390.95s |  to actually spot this activity.
390.95s - 393.31s |  That actually reflects a lot of what we've been seeing
393.31s - 395.63s |  in the wild with a lot of our different client bases,
395.63s - 397.15s |  to be honest.
397.15s - 401.23s |  I would say that in addition to some of the really neat
401.23s - 403.83s |  hackery kind of almost admirable things
403.87s - 408.07s |  and sophisticated, maybe less just clever,
408.07s - 410.95s |  unexpected ways that nation state level
410.95s - 412.43s |  threat actors are using,
412.43s - 415.59s |  they do make their way down into the pipeline.
415.59s - 417.99s |  There is a whole undercurrent on the dark web
417.99s - 421.79s |  of people selling everything from malware and ransomware
421.79s - 424.19s |  to initial access and even phishing as a service.
424.19s - 427.11s |  I have seen extremely sophisticated UI
427.11s - 429.83s |  that look like HubSpot or Salesforce
429.83s - 432.39s |  is gonna send you an email like no before,
432.39s - 433.47s |  but for bad guys.
434.11s - 435.35s |  It's pretty sophisticated.
435.35s - 437.63s |  So the tactics and techniques that we're seeing
437.63s - 439.67s |  at the APT level eventually do trickle down
439.67s - 443.07s |  to the script kitties who are just spamming out things
443.07s - 446.79s |  to all of the different organizations at the same time.
446.79s - 450.79s |  And one of the things to add to that is going to be,
450.79s - 454.35s |  we're seeing a lot more of living off the land tactics.
455.43s - 459.03s |  People who are using and abusing either red team tools
459.03s - 462.35s |  that were developed explicitly for research,
462.35s - 464.47s |  impact it, et cetera,
464.47s - 468.15s |  or they're using and abusing scripts and systems
468.15s - 470.63s |  and controls within the endpoints themselves
470.63s - 472.39s |  that were designed for system admins
472.39s - 473.43s |  to make their lives easier.
473.43s - 476.23s |  I mean, remote desktop protocol guys,
476.23s - 479.59s |  like it's designed for somebody with privilege
479.59s - 482.15s |  to go in and fix another user's computer.
482.15s - 483.95s |  Boy, I can't imagine how an adversary
483.95s - 485.55s |  is gonna use that, right?
485.55s - 487.79s |  That's an easy lateral movement.
487.79s - 490.51s |  And you get such friction from the business side
490.51s - 492.39s |  to turn that off because what's the solution
492.39s - 494.31s |  in an increasingly remote world?
494.31s - 496.87s |  So really what we've discovered is one,
496.87s - 498.27s |  you have to be really careful.
498.27s - 500.15s |  Allow listing and block listing
500.15s - 502.51s |  doesn't matter as much anymore.
502.51s - 504.19s |  I mean, obviously make sure
504.19s - 506.51s |  that you have a centralized software center
506.51s - 508.99s |  and we can get more into remediations later.
508.99s - 511.51s |  But the major threat actors we've been seeing lately
511.51s - 514.87s |  have just been using and abusing these particular tools.
514.87s - 516.99s |  And so it's time that we stop talking
516.99s - 518.71s |  about IOCs explicitly.
518.71s - 521.83s |  And it's time that we start talking, to Mitre's point,
521.83s - 523.87s |  about how they're abusing these tools
523.87s - 525.79s |  and how we can sense that change in behavior
525.79s - 530.34s |  if you really wanna do something about it.
530.34s - 534.62s |  The biggest thing that I always think about
534.62s - 538.90s |  when considering state-sponsored attacks is scale.
538.90s - 540.54s |  It's the amount of resources
540.54s - 542.98s |  that state sponsors can commit to it.
542.98s - 546.26s |  It's entire job and workforce.
546.26s - 549.94s |  So the days are gone when I could reliably hope
549.94s - 551.18s |  for a single adversary.
551.18s - 552.70s |  That's never the case.
553.62s - 558.14s |  So now I'm up against teams who has a lot of money,
559.06s - 563.22s |  a lot of compute, and very, very distributed
563.22s - 565.06s |  with interesting, sophisticated attacks
565.06s - 567.70s |  to spend their own R&D money on.
567.70s - 570.50s |  That's the landscape of sponsored attacks.
571.38s - 573.82s |  And that's up to your point, that's trickled down,
573.82s - 575.82s |  where we're now seeing the dark net,
575.82s - 578.34s |  some of those same tech from a few years back
578.34s - 580.02s |  available as a service.
581.06s - 585.78s |  And the next evolution to change the individual players
585.78s - 588.34s |  are models like WhiteRabbit Neo
588.34s - 593.14s |  that allows you to ask AI without guardrails,
593.14s - 595.34s |  hey, how do I do a DDoS?
595.34s - 598.98s |  And it gives you a pretty simple example in Python.
598.98s - 601.66s |  So now we have tools that can supercharge
601.66s - 604.38s |  the average person to become a one-person team.
604.38s - 607.58s |  And that is pretty terrifying to think about.
607.58s - 610.50s |  And now let's add that to the state-sponsored level.
610.50s - 613.30s |  All that R&D money, all that resource,
613.30s - 615.62s |  all that GPU access,
615.62s - 621.18s |  that's the current reality we're up against.
621.18s - 626.18s |  Okay, so I would agree to what other panelists say,
627.30s - 629.34s |  but one thing that I would like to add here
629.34s - 634.34s |  is when we talk about advanced adversaries,
634.66s - 637.54s |  are we really defending even for normal attacks?
637.54s - 640.58s |  So if you look at any previous hack,
640.58s - 642.82s |  as I said, Microsoft, for example,
642.82s - 645.50s |  if an organization at the level of Microsoft,
645.50s - 647.38s |  or for that matter, any tech organization,
647.38s - 650.98s |  they can't compromise just using a password spray attack.
650.98s - 654.94s |  That's not absolutely anything that is sophisticated.
654.94s - 657.26s |  You know, just so blowing our own trumpet here.
657.26s - 660.78s |  So when we teach, let's say Azure Red Teaming,
660.78s - 663.98s |  we don't even consider password spraying as a valid attack.
663.98s - 665.14s |  We mentioned that and we said,
665.14s - 667.74s |  okay, this is not going to work against Azure
667.74s - 668.58s |  without testing.
668.58s - 671.02s |  I mean, that is the sort of confidence we had,
671.02s - 673.50s |  we used to have on Microsoft.
673.50s - 675.98s |  So what I think is lacking,
675.98s - 679.58s |  whether it is the advanced adversaries
679.58s - 681.74s |  or your good attackers like penetration testers
681.74s - 684.78s |  or Red Teamers, is the basic hygiene.
684.78s - 689.02s |  Are we still leaving credentials in clear text on shares
689.02s - 690.54s |  in an internal environment?
690.54s - 692.38s |  Well, yes, probably.
692.38s - 695.34s |  So that doesn't need any research,
695.34s - 697.54s |  any research budget at all.
697.54s - 700.94s |  So that is what I would like to bring in.
700.94s - 703.22s |  Go for the basic hygiene.
703.22s - 707.50s |  Doesn't need an advanced adversary to read your credentials
707.50s - 709.74s |  or, you know, have an SMB relay attack,
709.74s - 711.82s |  or for that matter, I mean, you know,
711.82s - 715.86s |  sending a phishing link to one of your employees.
715.86s - 719.62s |  So defense in depth, not even that basic security hygiene,
719.62s - 721.94s |  if you follow that, you can actually stop,
722.34s - 724.42s |  using it once again from Microsoft's marketing,
724.42s - 726.14s |  99% of the attacks.
726.14s - 727.38s |  That's true.
727.38s - 729.94s |  So that is what my point is.
729.94s - 736.43s |  On top of that, I would add something for Red Teamers,
736.43s - 737.83s |  give them time.
737.83s - 740.19s |  If you are in an organization,
745.41s - 747.49s |  if you're in a position to make a decision,
747.49s - 750.33s |  do not get your Red Team operations done in a week.
750.33s - 752.09s |  Don't do that, please.
752.09s - 754.17s |  Provide the good attackers more time.
754.17s - 757.45s |  You know, APTs include the word persistent.
757.45s - 760.49s |  Have persistently tested your stuff.
760.49s - 762.69s |  It's not going to happen in a week or two,
762.69s - 766.29s |  where you give a couple of IPs to your good attackers
766.29s - 768.85s |  and say that, okay, these are our firewall IPs.
768.85s - 771.05s |  Let's see if you can get your domain admin.
771.05s - 773.73s |  That's not unfortunately how it is going to be
773.73s - 775.17s |  for the actual attackers.
776.01s - 777.65s |  Yeah, and one more thing for the Red Teamers,
777.65s - 779.09s |  domain admin is not everything.
779.09s - 781.13s |  Don't go for that all the time.
782.33s - 783.33s |  Yeah, that's for me.
786.06s - 788.10s |  What is this, Amit?
788.10s - 790.10s |  I stand with Nikhil on this
790.10s - 795.02s |  because he taught a generation of AI hackers in India
795.02s - 797.58s |  with respect to Red Teaming, right?
797.58s - 799.66s |  I also would like to add a point in there,
799.66s - 801.02s |  a humiliating one.
801.02s - 805.22s |  So I was performing Red Teaming for one of my clients, right?
805.22s - 807.54s |  I'm not going to tell Derek Knight, maybe.
807.54s - 808.94s |  I'm not, okay.
808.94s - 809.90s |  I should not.
809.90s - 813.42s |  So I found a service, like he mentioned, the hygiene.
813.46s - 815.70s |  I have seen a service account in there
815.70s - 819.74s |  that has been waiting for me for the last 18 years.
819.74s - 822.50s |  They created that service account in there
822.50s - 824.54s |  when I was studying in my, I don't know,
824.54s - 826.46s |  maybe eighth or ninth standard.
826.46s - 828.70s |  And it was there for like waiting for me.
828.70s - 829.70s |  Come and break me.
829.70s - 830.90s |  Come and break me.
830.90s - 832.46s |  I'm waiting for you, right?
832.46s - 834.54s |  It was there for 18 years.
834.54s - 837.18s |  It was like within a couple of minutes we got that.
837.18s - 838.02s |  I was amazed.
838.02s - 841.02s |  Okay, this is when the password was last changed.
841.06s - 844.58s |  That was in 2002, I guess, right?
844.58s - 846.94s |  This is, the basic security hygiene is important
846.94s - 849.66s |  because if you're looking at the attacks happening
849.66s - 851.62s |  around the globe, they are not,
851.62s - 853.02s |  sometimes they are not even using
853.02s - 855.02s |  a sophisticated attack vector.
855.02s - 858.42s |  They're just getting in, you know, by brute forcing SSH,
858.42s - 860.06s |  brute forcing RDP, or, you know,
860.06s - 861.22s |  finding stolen credentials.
861.22s - 863.54s |  I mean, these are very, very, very, you know,
863.54s - 866.74s |  basic matter of security hygiene.
866.74s - 868.50s |  I'm not going to take much more time
868.54s - 871.14s |  because once I start talking, then done.
871.14s - 873.86s |  Okay, I am going to give back to the panel
873.86s - 876.14s |  so that they can share their insights
876.14s - 880.06s |  on how even the major organizations are getting breached.
880.06s - 881.14s |  Right?
881.14s - 884.46s |  Some of them are considered to be impenetrable, right?
884.46s - 888.04s |  So I'm going to, you know.
888.04s - 888.92s |  Pass it back.
890.16s - 891.00s |  You started with me again?
891.00s - 891.92s |  Yeah.
891.92s - 893.76s |  Okay, I guess starting with me again.
895.24s - 899.00s |  So MITRE's got a pretty good example of this.
899.00s - 902.48s |  We came out in public a matter of months ago
902.48s - 907.48s |  that we had had a breach into a lab network at MITRE.
907.80s - 911.36s |  And so, you know, adversary had used a couple of zero days
911.36s - 912.76s |  against a security appliance,
912.76s - 915.88s |  had gotten into the ESX infrastructure
915.88s - 918.36s |  that was within that lab.
918.36s - 922.00s |  And so, you know, we try pretty hard at security,
922.00s - 925.64s |  but, you know, there, we patched as fast
925.64s - 927.04s |  as the patches were available.
927.04s - 929.72s |  We watched the stuff as well as we could,
929.72s - 931.64s |  but they were getting into places
931.64s - 935.00s |  that just hadn't necessarily been seen yet,
935.00s - 939.56s |  or, you know, just a couple days ahead of the zero days.
939.56s - 941.44s |  And so, you know, I'd like to suggest,
941.44s - 944.12s |  and I know some people in sort of software hardening
944.12s - 945.56s |  might get mad at me for this,
945.56s - 948.76s |  but that if an adversary is willing
948.76s - 951.52s |  to dedicate enough resources to it,
951.52s - 954.24s |  they are going to get into their target.
954.24s - 956.92s |  You know, if it doesn't work
956.92s - 959.36s |  through some sort of connected means,
959.36s - 961.48s |  you always have close access operations,
961.48s - 965.72s |  you can, you know, send somebody to the environment.
965.72s - 967.72s |  And so it's, you know, one of the reasons
967.72s - 971.16s |  that even organizations that are getting a lot right
971.16s - 974.24s |  are still having problems is that, you know,
974.24s - 977.52s |  we do have places that are willing to escalate
977.52s - 980.40s |  right up until they succeed.
980.40s - 982.32s |  And so as long as that's going on,
982.32s - 983.72s |  as long as we have people sort of willing
983.72s - 984.88s |  to dedicate resources,
984.88s - 988.04s |  and as long as you're a juicy enough target,
988.04s - 990.36s |  you know, it is, you're going to have to sort of
990.36s - 994.28s |  deal with containment, deal with being able to detect it,
994.28s - 996.04s |  deal with the fallout,
996.04s - 999.76s |  rather than just assuming that you can keep them out.
999.76s - 1003.52s |  We also just have so many interconnected complex systems.
1003.52s - 1008.00s |  And so cloud has definitely made this harder
1008.00s - 1010.92s |  where we have new systems that can get,
1010.96s - 1014.72s |  adversaries can get into more challenging visibility
1014.72s - 1017.08s |  in being able to monitor those systems
1017.08s - 1019.72s |  and just creating a bigger surface now
1019.72s - 1026.79s |  that people have access to.
1026.79s - 1029.67s |  That's very similar to what we've been observing
1029.67s - 1033.55s |  on our level, which I can't disclose who our clients are,
1033.55s - 1037.63s |  but we see, we're certainly not protecting the NSA yet.
1039.19s - 1042.91s |  That said, a lot of the attacks
1042.91s - 1045.11s |  that we've been seeing are opportunistic.
1045.11s - 1047.47s |  So to the point of basic security hygiene,
1047.47s - 1050.07s |  you don't need a pen test to know that you need
1050.07s - 1052.79s |  to get business buy-in to get MFA enabled, right?
1054.99s - 1059.31s |  It's the trick of convincing them that this is worth doing.
1059.31s - 1062.39s |  And to that, I can add a couple of stories.
1062.39s - 1065.11s |  For example, about one out of every four
1065.11s - 1068.75s |  or one out of every five of the people that we onboard
1068.75s - 1072.91s |  at our MDR are in the middle of an active BEC,
1072.91s - 1074.19s |  business email compromise.
1074.19s - 1077.19s |  They had no idea that they were compromised.
1077.19s - 1079.87s |  We would go in as part of the onboarding process
1079.87s - 1081.35s |  and our SOC will get tickets all the time.
1081.35s - 1083.51s |  Hey, we're pinging.
1083.51s - 1085.55s |  Can you isolate that for us, please?
1085.55s - 1086.39s |  Thank you.
1087.35s - 1089.99s |  And they got it as a preventative
1089.99s - 1092.39s |  without knowing that they were actively infected
1092.39s - 1095.51s |  and in some cases for months
1095.51s - 1097.11s |  before they were able to detect that.
1097.11s - 1100.71s |  And so to reiterate, if they wanna get in,
1100.71s - 1101.55s |  they're gonna get in.
1101.55s - 1104.67s |  And even if you're not a major organization,
1104.67s - 1107.39s |  all it takes is one person to get in.
1107.39s - 1109.47s |  And I think part of the problem here
1109.47s - 1112.99s |  is that we're dealing with people don't like the idea
1112.99s - 1114.55s |  of them going into our home.
1115.51s - 1117.67s |  Our servers, our environment, our endpoints,
1117.67s - 1119.87s |  this is where we live in a digital era,
1119.87s - 1120.99s |  especially if you work from home,
1120.99s - 1123.59s |  there is something very personal and intimate.
1123.59s - 1126.91s |  And thinking about somebody inside your system
1126.91s - 1128.27s |  is a little bit like coming home
1128.27s - 1129.47s |  and having the door wide open
1129.47s - 1130.79s |  and seeing muddy footprints in front of you.
1130.79s - 1131.63s |  It terrifies you.
1131.63s - 1134.35s |  So you spend bazillions of dollars
1134.35s - 1136.15s |  preventing that from ever being seen,
1136.15s - 1138.83s |  but the adversaries are sophisticated enough,
1138.83s - 1141.03s |  even at a script kiddie level,
1141.03s - 1145.07s |  thanks to trickle down dark web economics, I suppose,
1146.51s - 1149.47s |  that they're cleaning up after themselves
1149.47s - 1151.83s |  and the door is very carefully locked behind them.
1151.83s - 1153.51s |  You cannot tell.
1153.51s - 1158.51s |  And so what I would recommend and reiterate
1158.71s - 1160.67s |  is that you can spend all of this money
1160.67s - 1164.95s |  on every phishing email attention and antivirus and EDR.
1164.95s - 1167.99s |  Those are important core technologies
1167.99s - 1169.71s |  that you need for both compliance
1169.71s - 1172.19s |  and just getting rid of the kind of the base level,
1172.19s - 1174.95s |  but don't think that you've stopped everyone.
1174.95s - 1177.79s |  We had a supply chain attack actually
1177.79s - 1180.11s |  with a critical infrastructure partner.
1180.11s - 1183.11s |  It was a supply chain business email compromise
1183.11s - 1185.39s |  that I'm thinking of specifically.
1185.39s - 1188.55s |  Their partner was compromised, but didn't know it.
1188.55s - 1192.91s |  And one of their personnel sent an email that was expected.
1192.91s - 1194.31s |  They wrote it all nine
1195.83s - 1200.35s |  to our protected critical infrastructure environment
1200.35s - 1202.31s |  about a meeting and it had an attachment
1202.31s - 1205.59s |  and it wasn't the attachment, the email PDF
1205.59s - 1207.91s |  that was actually the vector.
1207.91s - 1210.95s |  It was the image file in this signature line,
1211.83s - 1213.23s |  which was fricking...
1214.07s - 1215.99s |  It was bad.
1215.99s - 1220.47s |  It was very naughty of them, but it was just so clever.
1220.47s - 1223.19s |  And they had ended up compromising several
1223.19s - 1227.35s |  of that other organizations.
1227.35s - 1229.23s |  And so these people were sending out
1229.23s - 1232.67s |  completely legitimate emails that were actually phishing.
1232.67s - 1237.67s |  And we tripped up on attempted NTLM credential theft
1237.87s - 1239.99s |  was how we ended up catching it
1239.99s - 1241.83s |  because at that point they got in
1241.83s - 1243.03s |  and it wasn't even your front door.
1243.83s - 1244.75s |  It was somebody else's and it was a complete...
1244.75s - 1246.63s |  You would never have guessed this was a phishing email.
1246.63s - 1249.27s |  I still read this and I'm like, is there a typo?
1249.27s - 1253.35s |  It was just the image in the email subject line,
1253.35s - 1255.63s |  excuse me, signature line.
1255.63s - 1262.28s |  So just food for thought.
1262.28s - 1264.88s |  At this scale of our organization,
1264.88s - 1267.16s |  the size of the United States government,
1267.16s - 1270.36s |  there is no version where they're doing
1270.36s - 1272.64s |  all the security by themselves,
1272.64s - 1275.12s |  where they're going to rely on
1275.12s - 1276.44s |  private industry vendors.
1276.44s - 1281.24s |  There's no version where that's remotely conceivable
1281.24s - 1285.27s |  to replace private industry.
1285.27s - 1288.31s |  At what point do you draw the distinction
1288.31s - 1290.67s |  of how you trust a company?
1290.67s - 1295.31s |  How far do you dig to find out if they have some,
1296.67s - 1300.03s |  at worst, a vulnerability they know but don't disclose
1300.99s - 1306.59s |  or willfully ignorant and something popped?
1306.59s - 1309.87s |  The hardest part isn't whether or not we have to
1309.87s - 1312.59s |  or are willing to rely on these vendors.
1312.59s - 1314.87s |  Without that level of trust,
1314.87s - 1317.83s |  we can't also move this industry forward.
1317.83s - 1320.11s |  We all have jobs for this very reason.
1321.07s - 1325.11s |  And at what point can we start forgiving
1326.39s - 1328.83s |  ways to disclose information that's highly critical
1328.83s - 1330.51s |  but also tightly held?
1330.51s - 1334.07s |  What's the difference between a zero day to hit MITRE
1334.07s - 1336.23s |  or a zero day that hits the White House?
1336.87s - 1340.31s |  Why is one more valuable than the other?
1340.31s - 1341.15s |  Thank you.
1342.27s - 1345.03s |  I would like to add on the same thing
1345.03s - 1347.31s |  on the supply chain stuff.
1347.31s - 1352.31s |  So that is what a lot of us call gentrification of security,
1353.59s - 1355.43s |  hiding stuff behind licenses.
1355.43s - 1357.27s |  You know, you get, you pay more.
1357.27s - 1359.67s |  If you want to be secure, you pay more out of that.
1359.67s - 1363.71s |  So for example, if you are an organization who has,
1363.71s - 1366.91s |  let's say their voice support outsource to Philippines,
1367.27s - 1369.15s |  your tech support to India and so on,
1370.03s - 1373.75s |  are you sure that the kind of security that your HQ
1373.75s - 1375.87s |  or your main office would have,
1375.87s - 1378.75s |  is that the same thing that your partners have?
1378.75s - 1381.99s |  And I can tell you that coming from a poor country
1381.99s - 1382.95s |  that is still developing,
1382.95s - 1384.95s |  I can tell you that no, that's not the case.
1384.95s - 1386.55s |  Having worked from people right away
1386.55s - 1388.23s |  from the easternmost part of the world
1388.23s - 1389.67s |  to the westernmost part,
1389.67s - 1393.27s |  that is something that always stand out.
1393.27s - 1396.35s |  An organization based out of, you know,
1396.79s - 1397.71s |  we call it the western world,
1397.71s - 1400.03s |  you call it the richer part of the world,
1400.03s - 1403.23s |  the kind of security features and the money
1403.23s - 1406.39s |  that they would have, even if it is the same organization,
1406.39s - 1409.63s |  is going to be entirely different across geographies.
1409.63s - 1412.95s |  And however, there is an internal trust that,
1412.95s - 1414.67s |  okay, this is my US office
1414.67s - 1416.11s |  and that is the same organizations,
1416.11s - 1417.47s |  let's say Bangalore office.
1417.47s - 1419.23s |  So we trust those guys.
1419.23s - 1422.47s |  However, the level of security controls the money
1422.47s - 1424.91s |  that is spent there, that is entirely different.
1424.91s - 1427.19s |  So that is a sort of a supply chain attack
1427.19s - 1429.59s |  that goes under the radar.
1429.59s - 1433.71s |  You look at your partners, but not your own offices,
1433.71s - 1435.75s |  if you're a large enough organization.
1435.75s - 1437.63s |  And if you are a small organization
1437.63s - 1441.91s |  that unfortunately not everyone is interested to talk about,
1441.91s - 1444.23s |  where you would have an organization of a thousand people
1444.23s - 1445.71s |  and a couple of IT guys,
1445.71s - 1449.43s |  no, of course, dedicated threat team, then best of luck.
1449.43s - 1453.03s |  No one is interested in talking about you at that time.
1453.03s - 1456.35s |  So for them, I would say, pick up the open source,
1456.35s - 1461.19s |  much hated tools, the OSTs that people create on weekends,
1461.19s - 1463.47s |  on their own time, pick them up,
1463.47s - 1466.91s |  run it on your own in your environments
1466.91s - 1468.55s |  and create your own IOCs.
1468.55s - 1471.79s |  If you're a small enough organization, no one cares.
1471.79s - 1476.67s |  You have to take care of yourself.
1476.67s - 1481.67s |  So I used to share a story about my school days,
1482.35s - 1483.87s |  shamelessly everywhere.
1484.67s - 1487.39s |  That's about I being bullied in the school.
1487.39s - 1489.19s |  So when I was in the lower primary school,
1489.19s - 1490.91s |  I was not this big.
1490.91s - 1492.59s |  I didn't have a mustache.
1492.59s - 1494.99s |  I was a very small, very lean guy, right?
1494.99s - 1497.31s |  So other people, they used to bully me a lot.
1497.31s - 1500.43s |  Then my mother, she got me into a karate school.
1500.43s - 1504.27s |  Then after a couple of years, I became a bit taller.
1504.27s - 1506.59s |  Then eventually I became kind of the bully
1506.59s - 1508.27s |  in my high school days.
1508.27s - 1510.51s |  So here we have been talking about
1510.51s - 1512.87s |  how we have been bullied so far.
1512.87s - 1516.07s |  All these organizations are getting bullied, right?
1516.07s - 1521.07s |  And now it is a time to learn from the wise people here,
1521.35s - 1523.83s |  how we can respond to such attacks.
1523.83s - 1525.15s |  So we have seen that,
1526.67s - 1529.31s |  so we have seen that all of these organizations
1529.31s - 1532.95s |  can be bullied, even using a small technique,
1532.95s - 1536.19s |  maybe to the, like, you know, Adam's apple,
1536.19s - 1537.47s |  very small technique, right?
1537.47s - 1539.87s |  Maybe you can try talking to your friends, right?
1539.87s - 1542.03s |  So we have seen that all these organizations
1542.03s - 1543.55s |  can be bullied.
1543.55s - 1548.11s |  Now, back to them, how we can respond to these attacks.
1548.11s - 1550.71s |  How can we respond to these incidents
1550.71s - 1554.11s |  in a better way that we could handle things, right?
1554.99s - 1560.90s |  Back at you.
1560.90s - 1562.70s |  So I think people might be expecting for me
1562.70s - 1565.22s |  to say use MITRE ATT&CK.
1565.22s - 1569.42s |  And that's not where you want to start.
1569.42s - 1572.90s |  I mean, and so a couple of people have mentioned hygiene
1572.90s - 1574.34s |  along the way.
1574.34s - 1578.50s |  And, you know, it sounds so basic,
1578.50s - 1581.06s |  but making sure that you're getting the basics right first,
1581.06s - 1584.06s |  you know, things like multi-factor authentication,
1584.06s - 1585.90s |  segmentation of privileges,
1585.90s - 1589.06s |  making sure that your network isn't just a flat space
1589.06s - 1591.78s |  that an adversary can dance around,
1591.78s - 1594.26s |  actually patching your systems.
1594.26s - 1597.22s |  And so, you know, working your way up through,
1597.22s - 1598.70s |  starting to look at behaviors,
1598.70s - 1601.26s |  looking at what people are doing in systems,
1601.30s - 1604.90s |  sort of more the ATT&CK end of things
1604.90s - 1607.86s |  where people are using EDRs and whatnot.
1607.86s - 1611.94s |  But I'm a huge fan if you've got your act together
1611.94s - 1613.38s |  on all of those things.
1613.38s - 1614.98s |  And, you know, talking a little bit about
1614.98s - 1617.78s |  how do we bring it back to the adversary.
1617.78s - 1621.30s |  I'm a big fan of direct adversary engagement.
1621.30s - 1623.50s |  So honeypots, deception,
1623.50s - 1626.22s |  actually placing adversaries in environments
1626.22s - 1628.06s |  where you're able to monitor them
1628.06s - 1630.62s |  potentially for long periods of time
1630.66s - 1632.26s |  for a couple of different purposes.
1632.26s - 1635.82s |  One is starting to understand what an adversary might do
1635.82s - 1638.38s |  when they think that they've broken into your environment.
1638.38s - 1641.34s |  If you've really got things going well
1641.34s - 1643.22s |  and you're able to get somebody to operate,
1643.22s - 1646.50s |  being able to see what exactly those things would be
1646.50s - 1650.18s |  that you might find out that they have ready for you.
1650.18s - 1651.86s |  The other thing is deterrence though.
1651.86s - 1655.34s |  So I've had some experience with getting caught
1655.34s - 1657.90s |  doing that by adversaries too.
1657.90s - 1661.94s |  And what we saw was that they were much more cautious
1661.94s - 1664.14s |  in how they operated in the future.
1664.14s - 1666.14s |  And so they realized that they had been caught.
1666.14s - 1669.02s |  They realized that they'd given up some of their trade craft
1669.02s - 1670.34s |  and we saw them back off.
1670.34s - 1672.58s |  We saw them spend more time doing
1672.58s - 1674.22s |  an attack we'd call discovery.
1674.22s - 1676.78s |  So figuring out, am I in the right place?
1676.78s - 1678.10s |  What's the system I'm on?
1678.10s - 1679.86s |  What are the systems around me?
1679.86s - 1682.38s |  Which can be really noisy activity
1682.38s - 1684.70s |  if you're watching for the right things.
1684.74s - 1687.94s |  And so serving as a little bit of deterrence.
1687.94s - 1690.82s |  And so once you're beyond the basics
1690.82s - 1693.50s |  and once you're bringing it back to the adversary,
1693.50s - 1697.06s |  if you really have all those things working together,
1697.06s - 1699.18s |  I'm a fan of taking it one step farther
1699.18s - 1705.98s |  and starting to interact with them a bit.
1705.98s - 1710.98s |  I will start with MFA, please.
1711.26s - 1712.98s |  Please, just MFA.
1714.78s - 1717.82s |  That's my security hygiene pitch right there for today.
1718.58s - 1721.10s |  But okay, so let me build on that then.
1721.10s - 1723.14s |  Why do more organizations not have MFA?
1723.14s - 1724.90s |  Why do more organizations not have
1724.90s - 1726.10s |  these basic security protocols?
1726.10s - 1729.06s |  One, we're overworked and tired and under-resourced.
1729.06s - 1730.74s |  Just straight out, right?
1730.74s - 1735.38s |  Second reason, people see security
1735.38s - 1738.26s |  not as an insurance policy, but as a cost center.
1738.26s - 1739.62s |  And by people, I mean finance
1739.62s - 1742.18s |  and I mean the executives who control the budget.
1742.18s - 1744.78s |  They aren't here right now, you are.
1744.78s - 1748.74s |  You are the advocate for every user in your organization.
1749.58s - 1751.62s |  You wanna know how you use sophisticated
1751.62s - 1754.58s |  nation state attacks at your organization
1754.58s - 1755.98s |  regardless of the size?
1755.98s - 1758.50s |  You use it as an example.
1758.50s - 1760.34s |  Executives and people with finance
1760.34s - 1763.18s |  actually understand headlines, right?
1763.18s - 1765.46s |  Find ones that are similar to yours
1765.46s - 1769.50s |  and say, look, this costs millions scaled down.
1769.50s - 1772.42s |  This could cost us this amount.
1772.42s - 1774.82s |  And of course, do your ALE calculation,
1774.82s - 1777.34s |  percentage of probability of something attacking
1777.34s - 1779.54s |  times the cost of the impact.
1779.54s - 1781.70s |  Remember your soft costs, your knock-on costs,
1781.70s - 1785.38s |  your lost contracts and time and reputation.
1785.38s - 1787.42s |  Those are all in addition to whatever
1787.42s - 1791.18s |  your insurance premium is going to go up by, right?
1791.18s - 1793.30s |  Present that then, and then go to them and say,
1793.30s - 1796.18s |  if we enable MFA, it costs like nothing.
1797.70s - 1799.98s |  And your executives who will be on the line
1799.98s - 1804.06s |  and talking to the press when an attack happens
1804.06s - 1806.34s |  and you have paper trailed
1807.38s - 1811.38s |  everything of your recommendation, you will be fine.
1811.38s - 1812.50s |  The organization ultimately,
1812.50s - 1815.78s |  unless you are in critical infrastructure and healthcare,
1815.78s - 1817.22s |  data is at risk.
1817.22s - 1818.90s |  The company is at risk.
1818.90s - 1821.14s |  Livelihoods are at risks, but not lives.
1821.14s - 1824.26s |  You will be fine.
1824.26s - 1826.38s |  The executives know that they're on the line.
1826.38s - 1828.34s |  Bring it home to them and talk to them
1828.34s - 1829.94s |  in the language that they most understand
1829.94s - 1832.18s |  because it's easy for us to sit up here, right?
1832.18s - 1835.62s |  And say, yeah, easy peasy.
1835.62s - 1837.14s |  We know the solution already
1837.14s - 1839.78s |  for a lot of these nation state attacks,
1839.78s - 1842.58s |  but when boots on the ground, we're not there with you.
1842.58s - 1844.78s |  When you're trying to illustrate to them,
1844.78s - 1847.86s |  you're all fired up from DEF CON, from Hacker Summer Camp,
1847.86s - 1849.98s |  and you're trying to justify this expenditure
1849.98s - 1852.98s |  to those people, bring it back to the money
1853.86s - 1856.10s |  and then demonstrate how this is
1856.10s - 1858.34s |  perhaps a minor inconvenience,
1858.34s - 1861.22s |  but it's so much better than the alternative.
1861.22s - 1865.58s |  And you have all of the stories here at this conference
1865.58s - 1871.02s |  to fuel that for your next budget.
1871.02s - 1873.42s |  The thing to consider is psychology.
1875.10s - 1878.30s |  You have to ask yourself,
1878.30s - 1883.30s |  not who or how you get attacked, but why.
1884.74s - 1886.14s |  What is the motivation?
1886.14s - 1889.06s |  And that motivation direct influence
1889.06s - 1891.50s |  to how the attack is carried out.
1891.50s - 1894.26s |  Because there is high value to attacks
1894.26s - 1896.78s |  that are very noisy and very obvious
1896.78s - 1898.58s |  that winds up on CNN.
1898.58s - 1901.42s |  There's also a lot of value to attacks
1901.42s - 1905.78s |  that go unnoticed for days, weeks, months, and years.
1906.78s - 1910.90s |  So understanding the persona of your adversary
1910.90s - 1915.06s |  is so critical to even have a chance to push back
1915.06s - 1916.86s |  to wear that hat for a day
1916.90s - 1919.82s |  and really consider beyond what this attack
1919.82s - 1921.74s |  or what this person, this human is doing,
1921.74s - 1924.22s |  but what's their motivation?
1924.22s - 1925.82s |  What's their culture?
1925.82s - 1927.66s |  What's their everyday like?
1927.66s - 1930.42s |  Why are they even in that seat?
1930.42s - 1933.62s |  So think about the fact that the other side,
1933.62s - 1937.22s |  there's someone just like you just having a job
1937.22s - 1940.82s |  and well, you are it today for the target.
1942.74s - 1944.06s |  That is a very good point.
1944.42s - 1947.94s |  One tech aspect that I would like to address is,
1949.34s - 1952.78s |  when we look at the defense versus offense side,
1954.02s - 1957.06s |  so the skills are not equal.
1957.06s - 1959.26s |  So on the offense side, on the red team side,
1959.26s - 1962.90s |  you would have tools that are not enterprise grade
1962.90s - 1964.58s |  if I use that word.
1964.58s - 1968.06s |  So for the attackers, you would have tools
1968.06s - 1970.42s |  like still mimic arts and probably something similar
1970.42s - 1973.22s |  that was written by someone bored over a weekend
1973.22s - 1974.82s |  or just out of interest.
1974.82s - 1976.50s |  Whereas if you look at the defense side,
1976.50s - 1978.22s |  they have a lot better tools.
1978.22s - 1982.22s |  So why is it that it is looked at
1982.22s - 1984.46s |  as a failure of blue side?
1984.46s - 1986.06s |  It is not the case.
1986.98s - 1989.58s |  The only thing that I would like to put in here
1989.58s - 1994.22s |  for the defense is we need to improve on what we look at.
1994.22s - 1996.70s |  So the parameter-based security is long died.
1996.70s - 1998.62s |  Do not look at it that way.
1998.62s - 2000.46s |  So there are some very good points made by her,
2000.46s - 2003.14s |  for example, to let your executives understand
2003.14s - 2005.70s |  that even that wasn't eye-opening stuff for me.
2005.70s - 2007.90s |  Of course, we need to speak their language.
2007.90s - 2011.38s |  But on the tech side, I would say look for identity.
2011.38s - 2014.22s |  So if I may use some very tech words,
2014.22s - 2017.10s |  you know, like say attacks very specific to Windows,
2017.10s - 2019.94s |  credential extraction, overpass the hash,
2019.94s - 2024.94s |  replay of tickets, everything is abuse of an identity.
2025.06s - 2026.94s |  Do you look at that?
2026.94s - 2028.46s |  Can someone steal my credentials?
2028.46s - 2029.78s |  Yes, try to stop that.
2029.78s - 2030.62s |  It is fine.
2030.62s - 2031.46s |  They get it.
2031.46s - 2033.94s |  But when they are using those credentials,
2033.94s - 2035.78s |  that is where you step in.
2036.62s - 2040.26s |  And as you said, you know, you push them back.
2040.26s - 2042.06s |  So that needs to be changed.
2042.06s - 2043.14s |  Yes, tools evolve.
2043.14s - 2044.94s |  We've got, you know, your CISOs may get, you know,
2044.94s - 2047.02s |  new toys from RSA.
2047.02s - 2047.86s |  I take names.
2047.86s - 2049.38s |  I'm sorry.
2049.38s - 2052.42s |  So your CISO may get new toys, let's say from RSA.
2052.42s - 2053.26s |  That's fine.
2053.26s - 2054.66s |  But look at the identity part.
2054.66s - 2056.78s |  That is where everything is.
2056.78s - 2057.70s |  It may be hybrid.
2057.70s - 2058.86s |  It may be cloud only.
2058.86s - 2060.54s |  It may be on-prem only.
2060.54s - 2062.30s |  Do not look at the network.
2062.30s - 2064.34s |  It is the identity.
2064.34s - 2065.86s |  That is, it gets stolen.
2065.86s - 2066.70s |  Yes, fine.
2066.70s - 2067.54s |  It will.
2067.54s - 2070.34s |  But when someone uses that, you step in and stop them.
2070.34s - 2071.66s |  That would be my advice.
2072.54s - 2079.80s |  I'm going to add a point.
2079.80s - 2081.40s |  The mic is not letting me speak.
2082.88s - 2083.72s |  Okay.
2083.72s - 2087.52s |  I'm going to add a simple point to what Stryker mentioned.
2087.52s - 2089.36s |  Like, you know, the small things.
2089.36s - 2091.56s |  So there is a, there was an executive.
2092.40s - 2093.24s |  Okay.
2093.24s - 2094.24s |  There was an executive.
2094.24s - 2096.44s |  I think he's still here somewhere.
2096.44s - 2097.28s |  I don't know.
2097.28s - 2098.60s |  I don't know.
2098.60s - 2101.56s |  What he did, he was using MFA
2101.56s - 2106.56s |  and he was using Google Chrome in his office laptop
2107.84s - 2111.69s |  with his personal email account.
2111.69s - 2114.05s |  Everything, all the credentials got synced
2114.05s - 2116.53s |  with that Google Chrome email account.
2116.53s - 2118.97s |  Then eventually he used the same account outside.
2120.49s - 2121.93s |  On a fine morning.
2121.93s - 2122.77s |  I don't know.
2123.57s - 2125.37s |  The breaches happens on Friday.
2125.37s - 2127.97s |  I don't know the logic of that.
2127.97s - 2131.25s |  It's only after Friday or during Christmas.
2131.25s - 2133.09s |  That's Christmas, New Year Eve, right?
2133.09s - 2134.17s |  I don't know how it is.
2134.17s - 2135.01s |  I don't know.
2135.01s - 2137.09s |  Maybe that's how it works.
2137.09s - 2139.09s |  Then that email got breached.
2139.09s - 2140.97s |  Then all the credentials were there.
2140.97s - 2142.57s |  Some of them might be having MFA.
2142.57s - 2143.85s |  Some of them might not.
2143.85s - 2147.17s |  And this guy, he was also using a small extension
2147.17s - 2150.53s |  in his browser as a substitute for 2FA.
2151.53s - 2152.77s |  I don't know.
2152.77s - 2156.17s |  Even after using 2FA, people can actually,
2157.45s - 2159.97s |  yeah, mess things up, right?
2160.89s - 2165.57s |  And we have like 15 more, I think, like, yeah,
2165.57s - 2166.89s |  17 more minutes.
2166.89s - 2169.05s |  I'm going to add something to Nikhil's point as well
2169.05s - 2171.09s |  about the defense part.
2171.09s - 2172.77s |  So I always tell people, everyone,
2172.77s - 2175.65s |  like, you know, the teams actually work for the defense.
2175.65s - 2177.53s |  That's where all the money is.
2177.53s - 2179.73s |  They have all the fancy tools.
2179.77s - 2180.61s |  You need to work with them.
2180.61s - 2183.05s |  You need to work with them very closely to like, you know,
2183.05s - 2185.53s |  share or provide more value
2185.53s - 2188.25s |  in terms of offensive security assessments, right?
2188.25s - 2191.85s |  Then I kind of started doing that in my life as well.
2191.85s - 2194.85s |  I kind of, you know, got close with someone in the blue team
2194.85s - 2196.29s |  and I had to marry her.
2196.29s - 2200.05s |  But then again, I tell people, don't go that far.
2200.05s - 2202.69s |  Be friendly with your defense guys.
2202.69s - 2204.97s |  Like, you know, share tactics, right?
2204.97s - 2206.53s |  Share the detection plans.
2206.53s - 2208.49s |  Then don't go that far, right?
2208.49s - 2210.57s |  I joke about it all the time, right?
2210.57s - 2213.13s |  And going back to the panel,
2213.13s - 2214.77s |  because we have like 15 more minutes,
2214.77s - 2216.09s |  if they don't have anything to say,
2216.09s - 2217.81s |  then we can take questions.
2217.81s - 2218.85s |  I will not be answering anything.
2218.85s - 2221.69s |  All these four guys will be answering your questions.
2223.49s - 2226.37s |  Unless you don't have anything more to say, yeah.
2226.37s - 2227.69s |  Yeah, let's see what they want to know.
2227.69s - 2237.74s |  Yeah, it's totally up to you, yeah.
2237.74s - 2239.82s |  Could someone get him a mic?
2239.82s - 2251.22s |  Set, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2251.22s - 2253.26s |  It's going to happen every time.
2253.26s - 2257.00s |  All right.
2257.00s - 2261.77s |  I'm just finding the sweet spot.
2261.77s - 2264.94s |  No mic?
2264.94s - 2266.54s |  Oh, okay.
2266.54s - 2268.78s |  You told a story about the email compromise, right?
2268.78s - 2271.14s |  And there was an image on the signature, right?
2271.14s - 2272.58s |  Yes.
2272.58s - 2274.50s |  I'm trying to wrap my head around it.
2274.50s - 2276.10s |  Why would the adversary do that?
2276.10s - 2278.70s |  Because it's easy for them to open,
2278.70s - 2280.42s |  it's easy for the victim to open the attachment
2280.42s - 2281.82s |  rather than the signature.
2281.82s - 2284.78s |  I don't remember the last time I clicked on an email signature.
2284.78s - 2288.18s |  So, the question had to do with the explicit
2288.18s - 2290.66s |  business email compromise example that I gave.
2291.58s - 2293.62s |  So, I'm going to give you a little bit of background
2293.62s - 2295.22s |  on what I was talking about earlier.
2295.22s - 2299.30s |  Why would an adversary put it into the signature line?
2299.30s - 2300.94s |  I actually have a right,
2300.94s - 2304.18s |  I believe we presented on this at Black Hat.
2304.18s - 2306.78s |  That was one of the three case studies that was picked
2306.78s - 2310.90s |  by my VP, Mac, as part of her presentation.
2310.90s - 2313.62s |  So, I do have the actual technical information there.
2313.62s - 2316.22s |  It is literally just blanking on my head right now.
2316.22s - 2318.66s |  I will tell you the motivation for doing something like that
2318.66s - 2321.66s |  because if you have correctly targeted,
2321.66s - 2323.74s |  speaking of knowing the persona, right?
2323.74s - 2328.74s |  If my client was a critical infrastructure client,
2328.78s - 2332.78s |  which means that they're susceptible to nation state attacks
2332.78s - 2334.86s |  like that is one of their targets, right?
2334.86s - 2338.66s |  If they get in there, they can have all of us, right?
2339.70s - 2343.42s |  So, it was worth it to them to investigate the supplier
2343.42s - 2345.22s |  and the type of people that they worked with
2345.22s - 2349.38s |  and do those months and that research that's required,
2349.38s - 2353.14s |  days and weeks and months in order to do that, right?
2353.14s - 2355.74s |  So then, to your point earlier,
2355.74s - 2357.38s |  you don't want to be noisy at that point, right?
2357.38s - 2360.58s |  You want to do something that will escape
2360.58s - 2363.30s |  and evade traditional indicators of compromise
2363.30s - 2364.74s |  where you're not doing discovery.
2364.74s - 2367.62s |  It's a weird APT spray and pray approach, right?
2367.62s - 2370.26s |  You're trusting that you did your OSINT correctly,
2370.26s - 2373.82s |  your research and your reconnaissance
2373.82s - 2376.74s |  that you have in fact infiltrated the correct one, right?
2376.74s - 2379.46s |  So, that's the first reason why you would do that supplier.
2379.46s - 2383.86s |  The second is you put it in the email signature line
2383.86s - 2387.26s |  because why would you write the phishing email for them,
2387.26s - 2388.10s |  right?
2388.10s - 2390.34s |  It's written by the victim.
2390.34s - 2391.30s |  They don't know their...
2391.30s - 2393.54s |  How often do you guys go and check your signatures?
2393.54s - 2396.50s |  Just out of curiosity, how often do you check
2396.50s - 2399.62s |  if somebody's changed your signature in your outlook?
2399.62s - 2400.78s |  Are you doing it now?
2401.78s - 2403.62s |  Yeah, I haven't looked at mine in a while
2403.62s - 2405.30s |  and now I'm suddenly very nervous.
2406.46s - 2408.74s |  And so, it's something that...
2408.74s - 2411.06s |  It's a space that you don't think to look.
2411.06s - 2412.66s |  You don't think to check.
2412.66s - 2414.78s |  We're looking for attachments on emails usually.
2414.78s - 2416.54s |  We're trying to distrust that.
2417.58s - 2419.86s |  The email itself triggered.
2419.86s - 2422.58s |  I don't actually recall what the image was.
2422.58s - 2423.66s |  It did require a click.
2423.66s - 2425.42s |  This was not clickless as I recall.
2426.26s - 2430.86s |  So, something about that image was close enough
2430.86s - 2433.02s |  and familiar enough to the person sending the email
2433.02s - 2434.86s |  that they didn't question it.
2434.86s - 2437.86s |  It led to an attempted sign-in,
2437.86s - 2441.54s |  which was rather clumsy and suspected.
2441.54s - 2442.94s |  I don't know if I can say,
2442.94s - 2444.50s |  but it was a nation state threat actor
2444.50s - 2445.70s |  that was suspected based on some
2445.70s - 2447.26s |  of the other indicators we saw.
2448.50s - 2450.66s |  And it did lead to attempted credential theft.
2450.66s - 2453.10s |  So, I hope that answers your question.
2454.10s - 2455.14s |  Yeah.
2460.17s - 2463.57s |  If you come up, we will read it back into the mic
2463.57s - 2488.52s |  and not kill you.
2488.52s - 2491.12s |  So, when you're dealing with an organization
2491.12s - 2493.92s |  with many, many endpoints,
2493.92s - 2496.84s |  what is the low-hanging fruit when dealing with tech debt,
2496.84s - 2498.20s |  when you're starting to implement this?
2498.20s - 2500.12s |  And I'll leave this to everybody else.
2501.56s - 2503.32s |  I don't know if we have quite enough cord
2503.32s - 2505.20s |  for me to answer this piece of it.
2505.20s - 2506.40s |  And so, yeah.
2507.68s - 2508.52s |  Just one suggestion,
2508.52s - 2509.88s |  if you're talking about an organization
2509.88s - 2513.76s |  that has 100,000 level systems,
2513.76s - 2515.32s |  and it has a ton of tech debt,
2515.32s - 2517.24s |  really hasn't done a lot yet,
2517.24s - 2518.48s |  start with inventory.
2519.80s - 2522.04s |  And so, it's amazing how many organizations
2522.04s - 2523.88s |  don't know what computers they have,
2523.88s - 2526.24s |  what systems they have hooked up to their network.
2526.24s - 2529.32s |  And again, it sounds super basic,
2529.32s - 2531.76s |  but it can be incredibly important
2531.76s - 2533.68s |  in actually dealing with a breach,
2533.68s - 2536.44s |  knowing what systems need which patches,
2536.44s - 2538.92s |  where you actually need to defend yourself.
2538.92s - 2540.68s |  And it's also sort of impressive
2540.68s - 2543.64s |  how many places don't actually have one
2543.64s - 2545.28s |  that are that sort of scale.
2545.28s - 2550.83s |  So, at least that's my suggested starting point.
2550.83s - 2555.24s |  Start with your executives.
2555.24s - 2556.76s |  Check their systems first.
2556.76s - 2559.52s |  That's my personal contribution there.
2560.76s - 2566.50s |  I'm gonna hit back on the human factor.
2566.50s - 2569.78s |  Without some kind of a way to measure,
2569.78s - 2571.98s |  track, framework, et cetera,
2571.98s - 2574.46s |  of here's my standard for passwords
2574.50s - 2575.86s |  that you should probably use,
2575.86s - 2578.78s |  or let's not all use the same root password
2578.78s - 2580.38s |  for every server out there.
2581.46s - 2582.34s |  Might be a good idea,
2582.34s - 2585.02s |  but how do you pass those standards down
2585.02s - 2587.46s |  when the organization isn't five people,
2587.46s - 2589.14s |  it's 100,000 people?
2589.14s - 2590.26s |  How do you set that standard
2590.26s - 2592.78s |  where the expected behavior
2592.78s - 2594.98s |  is that you don't likely have more than one IT team?
2594.98s - 2597.06s |  So, how do you pass information along,
2597.06s - 2600.02s |  and how do you also change the way people work?
2600.02s - 2601.50s |  Simply put, there are some systems
2601.50s - 2604.30s |  that it's just an utter pain to get to.
2605.14s - 2606.42s |  So, as an IT admin,
2606.42s - 2608.74s |  you're gonna come up with creative ways
2608.74s - 2611.38s |  to circumvent your own security
2611.38s - 2613.74s |  to be able to work on things.
2613.74s - 2615.58s |  So, how do you set those standards,
2615.58s - 2617.54s |  and how do you communicate them effectively
2617.54s - 2619.62s |  to have an expected,
2619.62s - 2623.38s |  we're all doing the same thing?
2623.38s - 2626.18s |  I'll say use the free tools.
2626.18s - 2628.90s |  That's how you find the low-hanging fruits.
2630.74s - 2631.78s |  I keep going back there
2631.78s - 2633.02s |  because that is what I experienced.
2633.02s - 2635.58s |  Do not go for the new shiny tools.
2635.58s - 2639.18s |  Anything that shows up as ultra-cool stuff
2639.18s - 2641.10s |  on your Twitter, on your Masternode,
2641.10s - 2642.90s |  go for the basic free tools
2642.90s - 2644.78s |  that have been available for eternity.
2644.78s - 2646.02s |  Go for them.
2646.86s - 2648.74s |  Create your own baseline.
2648.74s - 2650.82s |  That would be a very good starting point.
2652.30s - 2655.26s |  All of us, any one of us can be owned
2655.26s - 2657.14s |  by someone sitting in their mom's basement.
2657.14s - 2659.78s |  So, let's at least try to stop that.
2659.78s - 2679.66s |  So, that's where you start.
2679.66s - 2681.10s |  Okay.
2681.10s - 2681.94s |  Yes.
2681.94s - 2682.78s |  Yeah.
2682.78s - 2685.46s |  So, the question is,
2685.46s - 2688.18s |  who you think is a more dangerous threat,
2688.18s - 2691.62s |  a kid in their mom's basement or an actual professional?
2691.62s - 2692.50s |  We want to know the truth.
2692.50s - 2694.98s |  In my experience, it is the kid in the basement
2694.98s - 2697.54s |  because they are not limited by time.
2697.54s - 2699.02s |  They can be very persistent,
2699.02s - 2700.82s |  going after you for six months.
2700.82s - 2703.66s |  Whereas a professional, a consultant,
2703.66s - 2706.62s |  or even in your own in-house security team
2706.62s - 2708.62s |  would need to get that done in 10 days,
2708.62s - 2711.94s |  and you need the report on your table by 5 p.m.
2711.94s - 2714.22s |  So, the kid in the basement, of course,
2714.22s - 2716.10s |  persistence, consistency pays.
2717.30s - 2718.54s |  Thank you.
2718.54s - 2720.94s |  So, as we all respond enthusiastically,
2720.94s - 2722.70s |  yes, we worry about both,
2722.70s - 2724.42s |  but to your point,
2724.42s - 2725.46s |  that kid in the basement,
2725.46s - 2727.82s |  because that kid's pretty bored.
2727.82s - 2729.90s |  That kid just wants to try things and go,
2729.90s - 2731.42s |  I wonder if this works.
2731.42s - 2732.70s |  If I get caught,
2732.70s - 2734.66s |  do I get charged an adult with a minor?
2735.94s - 2738.06s |  They have less legal liability, right?
2738.06s - 2743.40s |  So, I would worry about that kid 100% of the time.
2744.16s - 2745.00s |  I think this gets back
2745.00s - 2747.28s |  to the annualized lost expectancy formula.
2747.28s - 2748.60s |  Honest to God, I swear,
2748.60s - 2751.04s |  I'm gonna do math to my response here.
2751.04s - 2752.76s |  What is the percent likelihood
2752.76s - 2755.96s |  that an attack will happen in a given year
2755.96s - 2758.48s |  multiplied by the dollar value
2758.48s - 2760.88s |  of the impact of that incident, right?
2760.88s - 2761.72s |  Okay.
2761.72s - 2764.12s |  So, while the hacker kid,
2765.24s - 2767.24s |  God bless us all,
2767.24s - 2771.44s |  is more likely to find you personally interesting
2771.44s - 2773.56s |  just to say they did it,
2773.56s - 2775.24s |  to see how far they can push,
2775.24s - 2777.72s |  and forget that it's a federal crime to do that.
2779.60s - 2781.12s |  That's more likely.
2781.12s - 2783.24s |  Let's think about what the actual dollar impact
2783.24s - 2785.60s |  to the business is, frankly, right?
2785.60s - 2789.80s |  Meanwhile, an APT is much less likely
2789.80s - 2792.32s |  to target an organization on average, right?
2792.32s - 2794.08s |  Just your average organization,
2794.08s - 2796.04s |  they might get caught up in a web,
2796.04s - 2797.28s |  they might be a supply chain attack,
2797.28s - 2799.56s |  but it's less likely that there'll be a direct target.
2799.64s - 2800.64s |  On the other hand,
2800.64s - 2803.36s |  the impact to the business is much greater.
2803.36s - 2807.08s |  So, yes, we worry about both,
2807.08s - 2809.48s |  and it's easier to get justification for the APTs
2809.48s - 2811.16s |  because they're like big headlines
2811.16s - 2812.48s |  and no executive wants to admit
2812.48s - 2813.72s |  that they've been pwned by a teenager
2813.72s - 2815.20s |  in their mom's basement,
2815.20s - 2816.20s |  or their dad's actually,
2816.20s - 2819.28s |  I had to share a room with my civil engineer dad.
2819.28s - 2822.12s |  But you need to do that calculation
2822.12s - 2824.80s |  and that risk for your own organization,
2824.80s - 2826.84s |  and then move forward with the solutions
2826.84s - 2831.44s |  that cost less than the actual expected incident rate.
2831.44s - 2834.28s |  And that is how you will make your finance people love you.
2834.28s - 2835.68s |  And that requires learning about
2835.68s - 2836.88s |  who you think is attacking you
2836.88s - 2840.86s |  and knowing what you have to protect.
2840.86s - 2842.58s |  I think the question is a trap.
2845.54s - 2849.42s |  So, I think the only right answer to that is it depends.
2850.42s - 2854.34s |  But, and so, whichever is successful
2854.34s - 2856.30s |  and causes damage to you in a way
2856.30s - 2858.26s |  that actually harms your organization
2858.86s - 2859.70s |  is the one that matters.
2859.70s - 2861.06s |  And that can be anyone.
2861.06s - 2864.46s |  That can be a script that got loose, went wrong.
2864.46s - 2868.18s |  That can be just a DDoS that accidentally got released,
2868.18s - 2869.42s |  but took out your network
2869.42s - 2871.58s |  and caused you to lose that big sale.
2871.58s - 2875.22s |  So, it can be anyone.
2875.22s - 2878.30s |  We do have a big focus on talking about state actors
2878.30s - 2881.26s |  because they're a unit that we can really consider,
2881.26s - 2883.74s |  that we've got cool names for them.
2883.74s - 2887.14s |  We might have giant statues of them at Black Hat.
2887.18s - 2890.46s |  But, you know, it can be anyone
2890.46s - 2893.94s |  that can cause sort of any impact to the organization.
2897.99s - 2900.79s |  I think that's our last question.
2900.79s - 2902.67s |  The goons are about to kick us out.
2902.67s - 2905.27s |  So, before that, I will just add one more point.
2905.27s - 2906.91s |  So, this is the power of community,
2906.91s - 2909.31s |  like the hacker community,
2909.31s - 2912.95s |  because we create new tools.
2912.95s - 2915.27s |  We talk, I mean, we teach each other.
2915.27s - 2917.47s |  We kind of, you know, use that in use,
2917.47s - 2918.95s |  you know, increase our defenses.
2919.71s - 2923.11s |  So, again, it is always good to be in the hacker community.
2924.23s - 2928.51s |  I mean, because from my personal experience,
2929.19s - 2931.31s |  if I'm sitting here along with these folks,
2931.31s - 2933.59s |  that is a part of community, right?
2933.59s - 2936.99s |  And I would like to thank the panel, the entire panel,
2936.99s - 2939.51s |  DEF CON, all the amazing goons out here,
2939.51s - 2941.59s |  all the, you know, participants.
2942.15s - 2943.55s |  Thank you. Thanks a lot.
2943.55s - 2947.03s |  And shameless plug, do visit Advasive Village.
2947.03s - 2949.11s |  Yeah. Thank you.
