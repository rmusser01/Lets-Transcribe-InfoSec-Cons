- Focus on evading modern defenses using QR codes
- Introduction of phishing with QR codes

**QR Code Basics**
- **What is a QR code?**
  - Quick response code, similar to a barcode
  - Scanned by devices to redirect to a link or data
- **Components of a QR code:**
  - Finder patterns, alignment marker, data modules, error correction
- **Versions and uses:**
  - Different sizes and versions for varying data storage
  - Legitimate use in various applications like EV charging, e-bike booking, and restaurants

**Phishing with QR Codes**
- **Why attackers use QR codes:**
  - Simple to create and share
  - Perceived legitimacy by users
  - Effective in bypassing email filters
- **Common phishing examples:**
  - Microsoft multi-factor authentication, DocuSign, other Microsoft-related phishing

**Detection and Evasion**
- **Detection methods:**
  - Manual detection by parsing images in emails
  - Black box solutions like Microsoft Sentinel to identify URLs from QR codes
- **Image-less delivery methods:**
  - Using ASCII art or CSS to create QR codes without images
  - Techniques to evade detection by email clients

**Advanced Techniques:**
- **Using tables for QR code creation:**
  - Tables as an alternative to CSS for QR code generation
  - Support by Outlook desktop client
- **Obfuscating email content:**
  - Utilizing tables to render keywords as images within emails
  - Prevents AI detection by masking text as tables

**Crucible Tool**
- **Features:**
  - Generates QR codes in CSS or tables
  - Can obfuscate keywords in email templates
  - Outputs in EML format for Outlook compatibility

**Conclusion**
- Demonstration of obfuscation technique using Crucible
- Encouragement to leverage techniques for improving phishing defenses
