 Thank you for joining us here today.
2.36s - 3.96s |  We are gonna do intros in a second,
3.96s - 6.80s |  but overall, we're looking to give you some insight
6.80s - 7.80s |  into the bug bounty world
7.80s - 9.76s |  from three very different perspectives on this,
9.76s - 12.36s |  everywhere from running program management,
12.36s - 14.06s |  running the policy village here as well,
14.06s - 17.20s |  or at least being very important regarding it,
17.20s - 19.22s |  all the way through to black badge winners
19.22s - 22.16s |  and everything in between for this.
22.16s - 23.64s |  So to start off, we'll do a few quick intros
23.64s - 26.00s |  and then we'll chat through our overall agenda.
27.40s - 29.24s |  So Katie, you're first up here.
30.04s - 33.20s |  Hi everyone, I'm Katie Noble, otherwise known as Lady N.
33.20s - 35.44s |  I am the person for the policy village.
35.44s - 36.86s |  So come see us at 2.37.
37.72s - 41.00s |  So my background is actually in behavioral analysis
41.00s - 43.36s |  and I got into tech a couple of years ago
43.36s - 45.60s |  cause I was thrust into it by the government,
46.76s - 49.24s |  did work for the government for many, many years.
49.24s - 53.88s |  And I currently run the product security incident response
53.88s - 56.48s |  and bug bounty for a big fortune 50 company,
56.48s - 57.56s |  but I'm not gonna tell you which
57.56s - 60.12s |  cause I don't represent them right now.
60.12s - 60.96s |  This is-
60.96s - 61.78s |  It's not on the slides, don't worry.
61.78s - 62.80s |  Yeah.
62.80s - 65.52s |  So in my claim to fame is that in my career,
65.52s - 67.12s |  I've coordinated over 20,000
67.12s - 68.92s |  cyber security vulnerabilities.
75.46s - 76.66s |  Definitely can't top that.
76.66s - 78.66s |  Hi everyone, I'm Jonathan Kuskos.
78.66s - 80.74s |  Some of you know me as Bad Idea.
80.74s - 82.62s |  I've kind of done both sides
82.62s - 84.02s |  of being a full-time bug bounty hunter,
84.02s - 86.58s |  also managing responsible disclosure programs.
86.58s - 88.62s |  And so I've probably got the intermediate experience here
88.62s - 91.02s |  of like half of her side, half of his side.
91.54s - 92.38s |  I'm currently the founder
92.38s - 93.20s |  of Chaotic Information Security.
93.20s - 95.14s |  My background is very much that of the offensive security,
95.14s - 96.50s |  red team or penetration tester,
96.50s - 97.90s |  fully on the vulnerability front
97.90s - 100.66s |  and identifying what's truly vulnerable,
100.66s - 101.66s |  how do we really fix it
101.66s - 103.26s |  and communicating that across aisles,
103.26s - 105.40s |  which is obviously sometimes difficult for engineers
105.40s - 107.70s |  as they get a little bit more up their craft.
107.70s - 112.98s |  Cool.
114.04s - 115.06s |  Hi, I'm Sam.
115.06s - 117.34s |  I'm a security engineer at Google.
117.34s - 120.42s |  I help run one of our nine bug bounty programs
120.42s - 123.16s |  in our kind of core google.com bug bounty program.
123.48s - 127.30s |  I have a couple of Defcon black badges.
128.68s - 130.72s |  Yeah, that's my kind of claim to fame.
130.72s - 135.72s |  All right, everybody,
136.84s - 138.60s |  I'm a senior security engineer at GitHub.
138.60s - 140.44s |  I work on the bug bounty program.
140.44s - 143.48s |  I like to drive fast cars on curvy roads.
143.48s - 146.80s |  I like to hit the track a lot when I'm not on a computer.
146.80s - 148.68s |  I love building bug bounty programs,
148.68s - 152.98s |  both private, public, from nothing to full scope programs.
153.82s - 155.90s |  I'm very excited to be here with you.
155.90s - 159.46s |  Thank you.
160.38s - 161.22s |  And I am Logan.
161.22s - 162.82s |  I work with Jeff, also at GitHub,
162.82s - 164.70s |  helping run bug bounty over there.
164.70s - 166.70s |  Had great experiences working with everyone on the panel
166.70s - 169.22s |  and I think we're gonna give you a wonderful insight
169.22s - 171.78s |  into everything going on here today.
171.78s - 172.62s |  All right.
172.62s - 173.90s |  Is that better?
173.90s - 174.74s |  Yeah.
174.74s - 176.26s |  All right.
176.26s - 178.78s |  So we're gonna pose this as sort of here's a question.
178.78s - 179.76s |  We're gonna let them talk
179.76s - 181.78s |  and Jeff and I are gonna be hanging off to the side.
181.78s - 184.62s |  So given that we're here to talk about bug bounty,
184.82s - 187.14s |  this seems like the obvious introduction.
187.14s - 189.30s |  So Coast Coast, we'll start with you on this one.
189.30s - 191.90s |  What got you into the world of bug bounty originally?
192.90s - 196.06s |  So this is gonna dial back about 10 or 12 years ago.
196.06s - 197.42s |  I started doing responsible disclosure
197.42s - 200.30s |  and bug bounty hunting as a very broke college student
200.30s - 201.90s |  with over six figures of student loan debt,
201.90s - 204.12s |  as it often happens here in the United States.
204.12s - 207.02s |  I had my first penetration testing job for a company,
207.02s - 208.62s |  but the pay wasn't great.
208.62s - 211.22s |  I wasn't really like the best at my craft.
211.22s - 212.50s |  We started off a little bit lower.
212.54s - 214.94s |  And so I started moonlighting bug bounties.
214.94s - 217.34s |  Back at that time, there was no HackerOne, no BugCrowd,
217.34s - 219.18s |  no commercialized sort of platform
219.18s - 222.22s |  to just bring you into it easily
222.22s - 223.60s |  and get you in straight in front of clients.
223.60s - 224.86s |  So the thing that I was doing back then
224.86s - 227.82s |  was actually looking at a lot of Google acquisitions
227.82s - 229.80s |  and the Google acquisitions would allow you
229.80s - 231.66s |  to submit a vulnerability
231.66s - 234.50s |  only after they had owned it for six months.
234.50s - 236.62s |  Pretty easy to find a list of acquisitions.
236.62s - 238.70s |  So I would find as many bounties as I could
238.70s - 242.34s |  and then I sat on them until the six month part
243.18s - 244.86s |  scripted the submission to happen at 12.01 that night.
244.86s - 247.26s |  Sorry, I don't think you were there at the time.
248.54s - 250.30s |  And that really got me into a lot of it back then,
250.30s - 253.16s |  but my motivations were a little bit split
253.16s - 255.26s |  between one being like a starving student
255.26s - 257.02s |  trying to make his name in the world.
257.02s - 258.58s |  Obviously the financial implications
258.58s - 259.90s |  of doing well in the bug bounty world
259.90s - 261.52s |  can be quite lucrous.
263.74s - 266.38s |  So I started doing that while also just using that
266.38s - 268.70s |  as a way to get better at being a security engineer,
268.70s - 270.38s |  at being a penetration tester.
270.38s - 271.22s |  It's a little bit different
271.22s - 272.50s |  if you take a client scoped engagement
272.50s - 274.62s |  versus what's public out there on the real world.
274.62s - 275.86s |  So you get very separate maturities.
275.86s - 278.50s |  You see a lot of different technologies really fast.
278.50s - 280.18s |  And I think that really expands your caliber
280.18s - 282.70s |  as a bug bounty hunter, just to see how things work,
282.70s - 284.34s |  how different people implement the same thing
284.34s - 285.50s |  in different ways.
285.50s - 287.22s |  And you get a lot of real world wisdom
287.22s - 288.70s |  and experience very, very quickly
288.70s - 291.34s |  if you do that over and over and over again, day after day.
293.78s - 295.54s |  Who wants to pick it up from there?
296.42s - 299.18s |  So I got in a little bit of a different way.
299.18s - 304.06s |  So one of my teammates from DEF CON reached out to me.
304.06s - 306.38s |  I was like, hey, I'm going to this live hacking event
306.38s - 307.22s |  in New York City.
307.22s - 308.06s |  You should come down.
308.06s - 309.66s |  I was in Boston.
309.66s - 311.18s |  And so I went down there
311.18s - 314.06s |  and I participated in this live hacking event,
314.06s - 316.62s |  only I was using curl.
316.62s - 318.02s |  I wasn't using anything else.
318.02s - 319.90s |  I knew exactly what everyone else was doing,
319.90s - 321.66s |  but I was very, very slow.
321.66s - 325.40s |  And so I made it my mission to get faster,
325.40s - 328.54s |  but then also to become a better bug bounty hunter.
329.30s - 330.14s |  Fast forward a couple of years,
330.14s - 330.98s |  well, I didn't find anything there.
330.98s - 331.94s |  Fast forward a couple of years,
331.94s - 333.46s |  I actually won one of the events.
333.46s - 337.06s |  So that was my kind of how I got into this
337.06s - 340.86s |  and how I ramped up from there.
340.86s - 342.10s |  Guess that's me.
342.10s - 344.82s |  So my background, like I said, was government.
344.82s - 347.50s |  I spent about 15 years in the US government
347.50s - 349.10s |  doing various things.
349.10s - 350.94s |  Like I said, my background's in behavioral analysis.
350.94s - 354.26s |  So it's all about why people do the things that they do.
354.26s - 356.34s |  So I found myself at Homeland Security
356.34s - 358.78s |  at the agency currently known as CISA.
358.78s - 360.48s |  I was not CISA when I was there,
361.50s - 365.02s |  but I was essentially moved into a position
365.02s - 366.70s |  where I was acting as an intermediary.
366.70s - 371.70s |  So researchers, hackers, can come to the US government,
372.46s - 374.18s |  even at that time, and say like,
374.18s - 376.44s |  hey, I'm being threatened by X company.
377.30s - 380.18s |  And it was my job to go to that company and be like,
380.18s - 381.42s |  what are you doing, man?
381.42s - 383.08s |  Like, this is not gonna work out.
383.98s - 386.14s |  And you can threaten that hacker all you want,
386.14s - 387.66s |  but I've got a fleet of lawyers,
387.66s - 390.06s |  so go ahead and try to threaten me.
390.06s - 392.66s |  And so I acted as an intermediary a lot,
392.66s - 396.44s |  basically as a, I feel like a camp counselor a lot,
396.44s - 397.28s |  which was great,
397.28s - 401.06s |  because I could use all of my behavioral analysis background
402.14s - 406.42s |  to mediate a lot of fairly high profile vulnerabilities.
407.94s - 409.26s |  A lot of the hackers that would come to us
409.26s - 412.10s |  were very, very serious about,
412.10s - 413.96s |  like they were looking at airplanes
413.96s - 415.58s |  and nuclear power plants and water plants.
415.58s - 417.32s |  These are very serious things.
417.98s - 419.82s |  That needed to be fixed.
419.82s - 422.86s |  And so that was really how I got into it.
422.86s - 426.06s |  And then eventually I moved out of government
426.06s - 428.44s |  into the private sector,
428.44s - 430.94s |  running bug bounty programs in the private sector.
432.02s - 432.86s |  Wonderful.
433.82s - 436.58s |  So moving on, and thank God I have good notes here.
436.58s - 438.38s |  One of the things you had touched on, Sam,
438.38s - 441.10s |  is starting with Curl and wanting to be faster
441.10s - 442.34s |  and working with everybody else.
442.34s - 443.78s |  So as you've gone through this,
443.78s - 445.30s |  and I guess starting from the hacker side
445.30s - 447.98s |  and sort of looking at it from the response side as well,
447.98s - 450.26s |  what tools, what techniques have you found
450.26s - 452.38s |  to be the most valuable when you're going through
452.38s - 453.70s |  and actually doing bug hunting,
453.70s - 454.86s |  without getting too, too in-depth,
454.86s - 456.74s |  because we are on the clock?
456.74s - 459.54s |  Yeah, so for me, it's mostly about,
459.54s - 461.78s |  well, what makes you move faster?
461.78s - 463.14s |  What makes you find things?
463.14s - 464.90s |  And more importantly, what makes you reject things
464.90s - 467.10s |  that aren't interesting as quick as possible?
467.10s - 468.30s |  And the faster you can do that,
468.30s - 469.98s |  the more targets you can look at,
469.98s - 471.50s |  the more successful you'll be.
471.50s - 473.86s |  Simultaneously, it's also important to use your tools
473.86s - 475.22s |  to find other targets.
475.62s - 478.22s |  So look for weird subdomains, look for weird places.
479.54s - 482.06s |  Maybe pivoting this a little bit on the program side,
482.06s - 483.66s |  program management side,
483.66s - 485.98s |  using templates to respond to researchers.
487.22s - 488.94s |  You'll often get the same invalid reports
488.94s - 489.78s |  over and over again.
489.78s - 492.02s |  If you have to write a custom response every time,
492.02s - 493.50s |  it's just gonna slow you down.
495.26s - 497.54s |  Yeah.
497.54s - 498.50s |  I'll take it from there.
498.50s - 501.18s |  So I think, first off, it depends
501.18s - 503.06s |  on what your particular vertical of security is,
503.06s - 504.62s |  because just by saying, what kind of pentester are you,
504.62s - 507.46s |  it's like saying, what do you do in cybersecurity?
507.46s - 509.42s |  And there's a million different verticals.
509.42s - 510.94s |  Can I quickly ask the room,
510.94s - 513.10s |  who are all the web application folks here?
514.18s - 517.78s |  Some, like network, infrastructure,
518.98s - 520.02s |  endpoint detection.
521.34s - 522.58s |  Okay, so it's kind of all over the place.
522.58s - 525.54s |  And so saying, using Burp Suite to go really deep
525.54s - 526.58s |  doesn't mean much to someone
526.58s - 528.98s |  who isn't an application security person.
528.98s - 529.82s |  And if you're someone
529.82s - 531.46s |  who's entirely in web application security,
531.46s - 533.22s |  you might be a little deer in the headlights
533.22s - 534.26s |  when you find a command injection.
534.90s - 536.86s |  And then it's like, okay, actually pivot off that box.
538.22s - 539.70s |  When it comes to the tools that you're using,
539.70s - 542.54s |  I think more importantly than just finding the right tool
542.54s - 544.70s |  that just helps find things automatically,
544.70s - 545.74s |  you really need to align that
545.74s - 547.18s |  with what your particular vertical is
547.18s - 549.46s |  and what you understand really well.
549.46s - 551.02s |  There's a lot of opportunities to go deep
551.02s - 554.18s |  in new areas of security that you might not be the best at.
554.18s - 555.58s |  So for instance, one of my weak points
555.58s - 557.82s |  is malware reversal.
557.82s - 559.86s |  So if I find malware on a machine,
559.86s - 561.66s |  I'm probably not gonna spend 20 hours
561.66s - 562.82s |  trying to figure out how to reverse it.
562.82s - 563.78s |  I'm gonna find one of my friends
564.18s - 565.02s |  who's really good at malware stuff
565.02s - 566.82s |  and say, hey, we're gonna partner on this one
566.82s - 568.58s |  so I can go back to what I do best.
571.34s - 573.14s |  Yeah, little pivot, held it down.
574.42s - 576.22s |  I'm gonna pivot further.
576.22s - 577.78s |  So we're talking about technology tools,
577.78s - 578.94s |  but from my perspective,
578.94s - 580.14s |  the best tools that we can have
580.14s - 582.54s |  are really the behavioral kind of tools.
582.54s - 585.38s |  So like common sense, I think is probably the best tool
585.38s - 587.14s |  that I have available.
587.14s - 589.10s |  I get a lot of reports from a lot of folks
589.10s - 590.66s |  and some of them are really high quality,
590.66s - 593.34s |  really good quality, criticality,
593.34s - 595.62s |  and some of them are not.
595.62s - 599.02s |  And some of them seem like they're social engineering
599.02s - 600.98s |  or just not good quality reports
600.98s - 602.50s |  until you actually start digging into them.
602.50s - 605.90s |  So I always make sure my engineers
605.90s - 607.26s |  really look at that report
607.26s - 608.82s |  because it could, at first appearance,
608.82s - 613.54s |  be incomplete or not well-formed or just garbage,
613.54s - 615.50s |  but in reality, some of the very best
615.50s - 618.18s |  critical vulnerabilities are in that way.
618.18s - 620.90s |  Even negative testing results are very valuable
620.90s - 622.34s |  because negative testing tells us
622.34s - 626.38s |  where there is something, but it may not be ready yet.
626.38s - 628.94s |  And so common sense to me is really important
628.94s - 630.86s |  and diligence is really important
630.86s - 632.78s |  and just being willing to answer questions.
632.78s - 634.74s |  Like the thing that drives me crazy
634.74s - 635.98s |  is when we get what I refer to
635.98s - 637.98s |  as like these cookie crumb results
637.98s - 641.22s |  where it's like somebody will send a report into us
641.22s - 643.14s |  and it will be like pieces.
643.14s - 643.98s |  And then we'll say like,
643.98s - 645.42s |  hey, do you have, like,
645.42s - 647.82s |  can you give me more information about this proof of concept?
647.82s - 649.26s |  And they'll be like, well, you're the company,
649.26s - 650.78s |  you figure it out.
650.78s - 652.34s |  And it's like, well, your report's
652.34s - 653.70s |  probably gonna go in the garbage
653.70s - 656.10s |  because I have 500 other reports
656.10s - 658.46s |  and you're taking time from those other hackers
658.46s - 660.90s |  who took the time to put the report together
660.90s - 662.06s |  so that I can actually follow it
662.06s - 664.62s |  so that I can pay them out quickly.
664.62s - 666.10s |  But we try to make sure
666.10s - 667.98s |  that we are taking as much time as possible,
667.98s - 668.90s |  even with those reports,
668.90s - 670.62s |  staying calm and going back to the researcher
670.62s - 672.86s |  and being like, hey, look, I know you're frustrated,
672.86s - 674.90s |  but I think you have something here,
674.90s - 676.26s |  but you need to work with me
676.26s - 678.22s |  to help me figure out what is here
678.26s - 680.94s |  so that I can get you paid.
680.94s - 684.02s |  So I would say like common sense and due diligence
684.02s - 686.98s |  are probably the best tools that I have in my toolbox
686.98s - 688.58s |  from running a program side.
690.70s - 691.62s |  Real quick, before we move on,
691.62s - 692.46s |  I wanna make sure that like,
692.46s - 694.34s |  we actually have like good answers for that one too,
694.34s - 695.98s |  because like, what tools do you use
695.98s - 697.94s |  if you're actually gonna get started?
697.94s - 699.46s |  Any sort of man in the middle
699.46s - 700.78s |  intercepting proxy for your browser
700.78s - 703.14s |  is absolutely a must for application security.
703.14s - 705.34s |  If you're needing to find new services on endpoints,
705.34s - 707.70s |  it's time to get really familiar with NMAT or NABU
708.18s - 709.78s |  if you're familiar with the Project Discovery Toolkit.
709.78s - 711.02s |  Everyone should just download everything
711.02s - 712.42s |  that Project Discovery has.
712.42s - 713.66s |  It's free, it's open source.
713.66s - 715.66s |  It'll really help you just get from
715.66s - 717.42s |  recon to vulnerability pretty quickly.
717.42s - 719.66s |  And there's some nuance that you can learn there.
719.66s - 720.62s |  But you're gonna need tools
720.62s - 722.42s |  that will help you go deep in an application.
722.42s - 724.10s |  You're gonna need tools that will help you go wide
724.10s - 725.38s |  across several applications.
725.38s - 726.94s |  Nuclei is really good for that.
728.02s - 731.26s |  Their version of NMAT called NABU is also fantastic.
731.26s - 733.14s |  And that will get you most of the way there.
733.14s - 735.78s |  At that point, I think you'll start having more hosts
735.78s - 736.82s |  than you know what to do with.
736.94s - 738.34s |  And this is where you have to start determining,
738.34s - 739.86s |  like, okay, where do I spend time?
739.86s - 742.10s |  What do I put my manual efforts towards?
742.10s - 743.34s |  And I think the thing that you wanna remember
743.34s - 744.94s |  is that you're gonna wanna use automation
744.94s - 748.02s |  to help you find targets to then go in on manually.
748.02s - 749.62s |  Because at least when it comes to the bug bounty world,
749.62s - 751.14s |  it's first and best dressed.
751.14s - 752.70s |  And the reason I wanted to talk about that
752.70s - 753.86s |  is because exactly what you just said,
753.86s - 756.10s |  you might get breadcrumb vulnerabilities.
756.10s - 757.58s |  And so let's say myself as the researcher,
757.58s - 758.86s |  I found something that's really cool.
758.86s - 761.30s |  I'm pretty sure this is gonna pay out.
761.30s - 763.70s |  I can spend two hours putting together a really good report,
763.70s - 764.70s |  but in that two hour time,
764.70s - 766.74s |  someone else could put in a low quality report,
767.50s - 768.74s |  and they're gonna get paid out.
768.74s - 770.62s |  And so there's kind of like a meta to bug bounty hunting
770.62s - 771.66s |  where you have to decide,
771.66s - 774.58s |  okay, how much information can I give that's relevant
774.58s - 776.22s |  to make this seem valid?
776.22s - 778.54s |  And again, if you're competing with other people,
778.54s - 779.46s |  I might start thinking,
779.46s - 780.94s |  maybe let me submit this incomplete
780.94s - 782.18s |  and then go back and edit it later.
782.18s - 783.78s |  Can we start looking at submission dates?
783.78s - 785.74s |  The first one is the only one that matters.
785.74s - 787.14s |  Is that the right thing to do?
787.14s - 788.58s |  You know, I think we can have a discussion around that,
788.58s - 790.70s |  but if there was a meta to bug bounty hunting,
790.70s - 792.42s |  that is definitely one part of it.
793.46s - 795.70s |  Just to add one thing to that, you'll never be faster.
795.70s - 797.86s |  Any tool you use will never be faster than mass scan.
797.86s - 800.14s |  So mass scan first and then move on.
802.78s - 803.62s |  Awesome.
803.62s - 806.54s |  Well, a great segue to that is for Katie,
806.54s - 809.50s |  where do human efforts provide value,
809.50s - 811.54s |  more value than automation efforts, right?
811.54s - 813.46s |  So pivoting off of tooling,
813.46s - 816.70s |  where are humans the most efficient, the most valuable?
817.62s - 818.94s |  Oh Lord.
818.94s - 820.66s |  So, I mean, I see a lot of,
820.66s - 823.38s |  I've started to see a lot of AI generated reports
823.38s - 825.38s |  come in last year or two.
826.06s - 827.22s |  And those are okay.
828.98s - 829.94s |  From where I sit,
829.94s - 832.98s |  like I work mostly hardware, firmware and software.
832.98s - 834.10s |  I don't work a lot of SAS.
834.10s - 838.58s |  So the AI stuff isn't really valuable to us
838.58s - 840.38s |  because we're looking at like hardcore CVEs
840.38s - 844.38s |  versus like what I would consider to be misconfigurations.
844.38s - 846.66s |  So it is a little bit of a different ball game,
846.66s - 851.66s |  but I think it goes back to like that negotiation period,
851.90s - 853.50s |  that negotiation period, right?
853.50s - 855.18s |  Like you can put in an empty,
855.18s - 857.78s |  like not an empty, but a placeholder report,
857.78s - 859.46s |  which we can have that conversation
859.46s - 861.06s |  about whether you should or not.
862.38s - 864.66s |  But there is more to it
864.66s - 867.82s |  than just lobbing the report over the wall.
868.98s - 871.66s |  You're gonna enter a negotiation period, right?
871.66s - 873.58s |  You're gonna enter a negotiation period
873.58s - 876.38s |  with the triager who's receiving your report.
876.38s - 878.34s |  You're probably gonna enter a negotiation period,
878.34s - 879.98s |  at least in hardware and firmware,
879.98s - 883.18s |  where you're gonna have to work with an engineer
883.18s - 885.10s |  or an engineer is going to be working on the backend
885.10s - 887.14s |  without your knowledge, which happens.
887.14s - 888.98s |  Usually that's what's going on in that quiet period
888.98s - 891.82s |  where they don't respond to you for months.
891.82s - 894.50s |  But they're working on trying to figure out a mitigation.
894.50s - 896.58s |  And so that negotiation,
896.58s - 899.62s |  anytime I walk into a room and it's, I want,
899.62s - 903.06s |  if I want anything, even like even ordering coffee,
903.06s - 905.66s |  like I want something, that's a negotiation.
905.66s - 908.74s |  Congratulations, you've just entered a negotiation.
908.78s - 911.78s |  Because, and that's a human to human interaction.
911.78s - 914.42s |  So you can lob the report over the wall,
914.42s - 916.22s |  but you're probably gonna get a better result
916.22s - 917.66s |  if you walk into it understanding
917.66s - 919.66s |  there's likely a human involved in there
919.66s - 922.54s |  and you're about to enter multiple phases of negotiation.
923.66s - 925.26s |  So that's my suggestion.
926.46s - 928.06s |  One of the areas that I really like
928.06s - 930.30s |  for human efforts over automated stuff
930.30s - 932.74s |  is like, let's say a new target comes my way.
932.74s - 934.70s |  I immediately skip everything unauthenticated.
934.70s - 936.66s |  I skip everything that would be the first one
936.66s - 938.46s |  or two clicks away from whatever the main domain page is.
939.18s - 941.26s |  I go straight to anything behind credit card functionality.
941.26s - 942.98s |  Because that is always, I feel like what people put
942.98s - 944.30s |  like on the last of their checklist.
944.30s - 945.94s |  It's like, okay, I'm enumerating the application.
945.94s - 948.50s |  I'm enumerating whatever the target platform may be.
948.50s - 950.22s |  And this bit requires a credit card
950.22s - 951.30s |  and it can't just be a gift card.
951.30s - 953.54s |  It has to be something valid or maybe like an ACH transfer
953.54s - 955.90s |  has to happen overnight for them to confirm a balance.
955.90s - 958.46s |  Go straight to that, get the clock running on it
958.46s - 959.50s |  as soon as possible.
959.50s - 962.30s |  Even if you need to go, I mean, I guess like,
962.30s - 965.58s |  this is not financial advice, just in case that matters.
965.58s - 967.22s |  Also not a lawyer, this is not legal advice.
967.22s - 970.74s |  All of those things, I have created separate accounts
970.74s - 972.54s |  that I can use for all of that,
972.54s - 974.90s |  where I can add bank accounts, where I can add credit cards.
974.90s - 976.58s |  It's separated from my personal stuff.
976.58s - 980.54s |  And the setup for that is, it's easier than installing
980.54s - 984.86s |  the old version of Bloodhound, if that's a bit of a deep cut.
984.86s - 986.98s |  But like, you should do that if you're remotely serious
986.98s - 989.70s |  about bug money hunting, because that's gonna put you
989.70s - 991.86s |  ahead of 80, 90% of other people who are out there
991.86s - 994.42s |  hunting for stuff being on the same login page.
994.42s - 996.70s |  Especially if it's something where a new target
997.18s - 998.54s |  has been exposed to everyone for the first time.
998.54s - 1001.22s |  And so you can imagine like maybe scope started at midnight,
1001.22s - 1003.06s |  but you're racing with a lot of other people
1003.06s - 1003.90s |  around the world.
1003.90s - 1005.22s |  And so you have to get to the functionality
1005.22s - 1007.94s |  that other people are likely to test last,
1007.94s - 1010.10s |  if you want to get the low hanging fruit first.
1010.10s - 1012.10s |  Obviously you can go deep, you can look at business logic
1012.10s - 1014.02s |  analysis, wherever that sort of stuff comes in.
1014.02s - 1016.62s |  I love anything with a contact us form.
1016.62s - 1018.22s |  Anything that requires extra information
1018.22s - 1020.18s |  to get to deeper areas of the application,
1020.18s - 1021.74s |  it's gonna take automation even further
1021.74s - 1022.66s |  to get to those areas.
1022.66s - 1024.62s |  And that's gonna depend on how good whoever's automation
1024.62s - 1026.94s |  is at spidering, which it's already not good
1026.94s - 1029.54s |  at maintaining authenticated versus unauthenticated states
1029.54s - 1031.58s |  as soon as something hits like a logout feature,
1031.58s - 1034.38s |  or you trigger rate limiting that logs you out.
1034.38s - 1036.30s |  Or God forbid it's still a WebSphere application.
1036.30s - 1039.30s |  Those have unique URLs every time you log in or out.
1039.30s - 1041.34s |  Automation completely fails at those.
1041.34s - 1043.42s |  And so when you start identifying those technologies,
1043.42s - 1045.46s |  I mean, I think the spider sense starts kicking in
1045.46s - 1048.10s |  where you're like, okay, there's likely not a lot
1048.10s - 1049.74s |  of competition on this one.
1049.74s - 1051.14s |  If I was gonna spend eight hours somewhere,
1051.14s - 1053.82s |  this might be worth the time because it's a lot
1053.82s - 1055.86s |  of cost benefit analysis on where your efforts
1055.86s - 1057.02s |  are gonna go.
1057.02s - 1059.74s |  And it really sucks if you spend eight hours working
1059.74s - 1061.30s |  on something that you're pretty sure is vulnerable,
1061.30s - 1062.62s |  you don't find anything, and now you have
1062.62s - 1064.34s |  the sunken cost fallacy sort of thought
1064.34s - 1066.34s |  of what did I do with my day?
1066.34s - 1067.86s |  Which I think we're gonna get into that later question,
1067.86s - 1069.62s |  so I don't wanna go too much on it here.
1069.62s - 1070.90s |  But that's where I would spend human efforts
1070.90s - 1071.98s |  over automation ones.
1073.54s - 1076.90s |  So just to add to the human effort.
1076.90s - 1080.18s |  So when you're testing web applications,
1080.18s - 1081.26s |  you come across like a laugh.
1082.10s - 1084.26s |  It's an easy way to get yourself banned,
1084.26s - 1085.82s |  especially using automation.
1085.82s - 1090.18s |  And so as a human, you have the ability to infer
1090.18s - 1093.66s |  that something is vulnerable without necessarily proving it
1093.66s - 1096.34s |  using like a full exploit that would get your IP banned,
1096.34s - 1098.74s |  that would get your account banned.
1099.82s - 1103.74s |  When I see a laugh, it doesn't actually...
1103.74s - 1107.34s |  For some researchers, it can be like a showstopper.
1107.34s - 1109.22s |  For me, it's a place I'll actually dive in more
1109.22s - 1112.58s |  because you find the right quote character,
1112.58s - 1113.58s |  that's gonna get past the laugh
1113.58s - 1115.78s |  and it might throw us some interesting error.
1119.09s - 1120.85s |  Yeah, I see that as like a really a place
1120.85s - 1122.65s |  where humans thrive versus AI.
1123.93s - 1125.61s |  Simultaneously, I'm sure AI will get better
1125.61s - 1127.09s |  or automation will get better.
1129.33s - 1131.33s |  When you find that a laugh has blacklisted you,
1131.33s - 1132.57s |  don't forget about it.
1132.57s - 1135.57s |  If Akamai or CloudFlare or something has locked you out,
1135.57s - 1136.57s |  write down that application,
1136.57s - 1138.93s |  go back to it later with a different IP
1138.93s - 1141.37s |  or walk out other IPs as you're scanning for everything.
1141.37s - 1142.85s |  Because if you end up with a list of things
1142.85s - 1143.69s |  that are behind CloudFlare
1143.69s - 1145.05s |  and things that are behind Akamai,
1145.05s - 1147.57s |  guess where you should spend human efforts?
1147.57s - 1149.49s |  Exactly all of those.
1149.49s - 1151.05s |  This is also like a little bit in the weeds,
1151.05s - 1154.81s |  but if you find yourself getting a laugh block
1154.81s - 1158.81s |  coming back from a server that's not Akamai or CloudFlare,
1158.81s - 1160.53s |  that means that you have the potential
1160.53s - 1162.29s |  to toss an application
1162.29s - 1166.01s |  by blocking the front end service sometimes.
1166.01s - 1170.92s |  I don't know, it's a fun variant of this.
1171.80s - 1173.96s |  So it's easy to get in really deep
1173.96s - 1175.80s |  and go into rabbit holes
1175.80s - 1178.44s |  and eventually also just get tired
1178.44s - 1181.00s |  of responding to incidents, right?
1181.00s - 1182.80s |  How do you find balance?
1182.80s - 1184.88s |  What are some potential tips you can offer
1184.88s - 1188.60s |  to folks who are proactively burning out
1188.60s - 1190.08s |  or how do you approach it?
1190.08s - 1193.16s |  And I would love for Sam to start with this.
1193.16s - 1194.20s |  Sure.
1194.20s - 1196.64s |  So on the researcher side,
1196.64s - 1199.36s |  I mean, it's the same as DEF CON.
1199.36s - 1200.88s |  I'm really excited to be here.
1200.88s - 1201.80s |  I don't want to sleep.
1201.80s - 1202.80s |  I don't want to eat.
1202.80s - 1204.88s |  I don't want to, well, I should shower.
1206.68s - 1209.16s |  It's, everyone should shower.
1209.16s - 1210.96s |  It's the same thing with bug bounty hunting.
1210.96s - 1212.08s |  It can become very addictive
1212.08s - 1215.32s |  and you have to balance it with the rest of your life.
1215.32s - 1216.56s |  If you're having a bad week at work,
1216.56s - 1218.72s |  maybe don't do bug bounty at night.
1220.12s - 1223.60s |  I think like simultaneously on the program side,
1223.60s - 1225.40s |  if you're the only program manager
1225.40s - 1227.04s |  and you're getting in 25 reports a day,
1227.04s - 1228.96s |  like that's not sustainable.
1229.96s - 1230.92s |  At least within Google,
1230.92s - 1234.40s |  like we try and go for like no heroes policy.
1234.40s - 1238.52s |  We have a, well, roughly once every seven week
1238.52s - 1241.68s |  or so rotation, a little bit less than that now, I think,
1241.68s - 1244.64s |  where you're only on call once out of every seven weeks
1244.64s - 1247.00s |  and that helps keep things sane.
1250.25s - 1251.17s |  I'm next.
1251.17s - 1252.45s |  So yeah, I agree.
1252.45s - 1254.37s |  Like everything, every job,
1254.37s - 1255.93s |  everything that you're passionate about,
1255.93s - 1258.37s |  you're gonna like have burnout in.
1258.37s - 1260.57s |  From an industry perspective,
1261.05s - 1263.37s |  we have a lot of engineers that are sitting,
1263.37s - 1265.73s |  receiving reports, doing triage, doing mitigation,
1265.73s - 1268.57s |  doing disclosure planning, and it gets really exhausting.
1268.57s - 1270.25s |  I had an engineer tell me the other day,
1270.25s - 1272.61s |  you know, like I have 75 tickets
1272.61s - 1274.85s |  and I'm not even happy when I close a ticket anymore
1274.85s - 1279.21s |  because I know that I still have 74 tickets to close.
1279.21s - 1280.61s |  Like she used to be like really excited
1280.61s - 1285.61s |  every time she closed a report and now not so much.
1285.77s - 1287.17s |  And like, that's real.
1287.17s - 1288.49s |  I think everyone is undermanned,
1288.53s - 1290.81s |  especially with like a lot of the technology layoffs
1290.81s - 1293.13s |  that have happened in the last four to five years.
1293.13s - 1296.37s |  Like being smarter about how we do things,
1296.37s - 1299.29s |  incorporating tools on how we actually handle
1299.29s - 1301.73s |  vulnerabilities and disclosures,
1301.73s - 1302.65s |  I think is really important.
1302.65s - 1305.09s |  Looking for efficiencies and building those efficiencies
1305.09s - 1307.61s |  and automation into systems and processes
1307.61s - 1308.85s |  is incredibly important.
1309.89s - 1311.93s |  I would rather that,
1311.93s - 1314.17s |  I see it kind of like a doctor's office, right?
1314.17s - 1318.53s |  I would rather that my doctors be doing surgery
1318.53s - 1320.77s |  than filling out insurance forms.
1320.77s - 1325.77s |  So where you can offload onto a specific triage team,
1327.17s - 1329.41s |  you should do that.
1329.41s - 1331.13s |  So your mitigation engineers
1331.13s - 1333.29s |  are not doing triage and mitigation.
1333.29s - 1335.85s |  So it's about like balancing workload, balancing processes,
1335.85s - 1336.89s |  making sure that you're looking
1336.89s - 1341.89s |  for automation opportunities, and we do a rotation.
1341.93s - 1345.41s |  So our engineers will only do tickets
1345.41s - 1347.37s |  for a certain amount of time.
1347.37s - 1350.49s |  So it's usually about three months and then that's it.
1350.49s - 1352.45s |  They're not doing tickets again for another three months.
1352.45s - 1354.29s |  They move into an entirely different job.
1354.29s - 1356.45s |  So maybe today they're doing triage tickets
1356.45s - 1359.93s |  and when their three months is up, they're doing comms,
1359.93s - 1361.05s |  they're doing disclosures,
1361.05s - 1362.81s |  they're doing something entirely different
1362.81s - 1366.13s |  so that it doesn't matter that she has 74 tickets left,
1366.13s - 1368.21s |  that's now somebody else's problem
1368.21s - 1370.09s |  for the next three months.
1370.09s - 1371.93s |  So we try to incorporate a rotation
1373.17s - 1374.01s |  and we try to make sure
1374.01s - 1375.77s |  that we're looking for those automation opportunities.
1375.77s - 1378.29s |  Technology has evolved and changed so much
1378.29s - 1380.93s |  in the last several years that it's really irresponsible
1380.93s - 1382.45s |  if you're not on the industry side
1382.45s - 1385.17s |  looking for ways to make the processes better
1385.17s - 1388.33s |  and easier and more efficient for your engineering team.
1388.33s - 1390.45s |  That makes things better and more efficient
1390.45s - 1392.77s |  and faster for your bug hunters.
1392.77s - 1394.97s |  Faster that's triaged, the faster they get paid,
1394.97s - 1397.53s |  the happier they are, and then everyone is happy.
1398.41s - 1401.25s |  So I think it's irresponsible to not be thinking
1401.25s - 1406.25s |  about your team health along with building those processes,
1406.33s - 1407.77s |  making sure you're efficient
1407.77s - 1413.35s |  and really just keeping an eye on your people.
1413.35s - 1414.19s |  Very well said.
1415.87s - 1417.63s |  So this thought kind of just crossed my mind.
1417.63s - 1419.35s |  I don't think any of us thought 10 years ago
1419.35s - 1423.19s |  that we'd get a dopamine hit from seeing an alert box pop up.
1423.19s - 1426.43s |  And it feels just like pulling that slot machine,
1426.43s - 1427.71s |  if we're gonna make a gambling reference
1427.75s - 1430.55s |  because we're in Vegas and just seeing something pop up.
1432.47s - 1433.39s |  Dopamine feels great.
1433.39s - 1434.99s |  And so the same thing,
1434.99s - 1437.51s |  anytime any scanner comes back as something that's positive
1437.51s - 1438.71s |  and then you verify and it's really there,
1438.71s - 1440.47s |  like that feeling of like, oh yes,
1440.47s - 1445.47s |  like I just got this thing is just infectious.
1446.91s - 1448.67s |  Just like with anything that you enjoy doing,
1448.67s - 1450.03s |  balance is absolutely key.
1450.03s - 1452.39s |  You have to keep a time on that clock.
1452.39s - 1454.19s |  Some of us have real addictive personalities
1454.19s - 1455.95s |  and suddenly you find yourself,
1455.95s - 1457.51s |  it's 4 a.m., you haven't had dinner
1458.47s - 1459.95s |  and you've got a lot to do the next day,
1459.95s - 1462.91s |  but we can get real addicted to hunting for vulnerabilities
1462.91s - 1465.35s |  in new content that is all,
1465.35s - 1466.43s |  especially if you're going from application
1466.43s - 1467.51s |  to application to application,
1467.51s - 1468.87s |  there's always something new.
1468.87s - 1470.95s |  There's always something like some new rabbit hole
1470.95s - 1472.59s |  that's pulling your interest
1472.59s - 1473.91s |  or you're working on one application
1473.91s - 1475.19s |  because you've gone through so many,
1475.19s - 1476.23s |  the light bulb pops on something
1476.23s - 1477.95s |  that you were touching an hour ago.
1479.47s - 1481.35s |  I should probably mention this with the tool bit earlier,
1481.35s - 1483.35s |  but like actually the best tool that I have
1483.35s - 1485.67s |  is a timer that I have on my desk.
1485.71s - 1487.79s |  And I tell myself the 15 minute rule.
1487.79s - 1490.27s |  So after I've been working on a particular area
1490.27s - 1491.47s |  of an application or a target
1491.47s - 1492.63s |  for just a couple of minutes,
1492.63s - 1495.11s |  if nothing has been like immediately apparent
1495.11s - 1497.23s |  that something is there, I start the timer.
1497.23s - 1498.59s |  That 15 minute timer goes off
1498.59s - 1500.83s |  and I've not made any meaningful progress,
1500.83s - 1502.35s |  go to the next functionality
1502.35s - 1504.03s |  or consider taking a break
1504.03s - 1506.51s |  and stepping away from the computer.
1506.51s - 1508.43s |  That'll help you find more vulnerabilities too
1508.43s - 1509.75s |  because I can't tell you how many times
1509.75s - 1510.59s |  I've been on a page
1510.59s - 1512.59s |  where I was just certain SQL injection is here.
1512.59s - 1515.03s |  Like there's just something I'm just not getting across.
1515.07s - 1516.59s |  It's not actually vulnerable.
1516.59s - 1517.43s |  And if you would have just gone
1517.43s - 1518.27s |  to the next bit of functionality,
1518.27s - 1519.11s |  there might be RCE there
1519.11s - 1520.39s |  or there might be something,
1520.39s - 1522.59s |  some breadcrumb that's worth chasing down.
1522.59s - 1524.03s |  So manage your time effectively,
1524.03s - 1526.27s |  just like anything else isn't specific to hacking.
1526.27s - 1528.19s |  This is the same advice for anyone
1528.19s - 1530.39s |  who's seeking like mental health wellness.
1531.39s - 1532.71s |  What we do is very exciting.
1532.71s - 1533.87s |  It's very addicting.
1533.87s - 1535.59s |  And those of us with addictive personalities
1535.59s - 1537.39s |  really need to keep a grasp on that.
1539.07s - 1540.55s |  Going back to the program side for a minute,
1540.55s - 1542.27s |  you also control your own economy.
1543.23s - 1545.07s |  If you're getting in a ton of reports,
1545.07s - 1547.75s |  like consider lowering payments.
1547.75s - 1549.75s |  You'll still probably get a few reports in,
1549.75s - 1552.47s |  but like that might dissuade researchers
1552.47s - 1553.99s |  from spending as much time in your program.
1553.99s - 1555.55s |  Similarly, if you're not getting reports in,
1555.55s - 1558.11s |  then pay more, you know,
1558.11s - 1560.89s |  control that input to some extent anyways.
1562.15s - 1562.99s |  And that kind of gets more
1562.99s - 1567.40s |  to like the business side of everything, but yeah.
1567.40s - 1568.24s |  Very cool.
1568.24s - 1570.48s |  So this is one of my personal favorite questions.
1571.48s - 1572.48s |  From a hacker view,
1572.48s - 1575.56s |  what makes a product or an application a good target?
1575.56s - 1578.32s |  What makes a good candidate for a bug bounty program
1578.32s - 1579.56s |  from the program side as well
1579.56s - 1581.68s |  when you're considering spinning up a program?
1581.68s - 1584.08s |  But we're gonna start with Kuzco's for this one.
1585.16s - 1586.00s |  Sure.
1586.00s - 1589.12s |  So as much as I hate to say it, I'm gonna say it.
1589.12s - 1591.52s |  We've all heard shift left a million times
1591.52s - 1592.92s |  and anyone working in security
1592.92s - 1594.84s |  has heard this sort of thing it brought up.
1594.84s - 1596.56s |  And the concept is basically the earlier
1596.56s - 1597.68s |  that we can identify bugs
1597.68s - 1599.16s |  and fix them in the development life cycle,
1599.16s - 1600.96s |  the cheaper it will be to remediate.
1601.96s - 1604.40s |  Bug bounty programs are as far right as possible
1604.40s - 1606.00s |  as that shift left could be.
1606.00s - 1609.24s |  So when we're, as you're running a program,
1609.24s - 1610.44s |  if you're identifying candidates
1610.44s - 1612.20s |  for your bug bounty program,
1612.20s - 1613.96s |  it should be something that has already had
1613.96s - 1616.44s |  all the gambits of internal due diligence.
1616.44s - 1618.56s |  In an ideal world, you have, you know,
1618.56s - 1620.20s |  secret scanning hooked into the CICD.
1620.20s - 1622.76s |  You have rule sets for insecure functions not being used.
1622.76s - 1624.00s |  You're running some sort of SAS tool.
1624.00s - 1625.28s |  You're running some sort of DAS tool.
1625.28s - 1626.92s |  You're running some sort of runtime analysis.
1626.92s - 1627.76s |  And maybe if you're lucky,
1627.76s - 1628.96s |  you have an internal pen testing team
1628.96s - 1631.12s |  who can give it all once over assessment
1631.12s - 1632.96s |  before it actually goes out to production
1632.96s - 1635.44s |  and, you know, the real world.
1635.44s - 1636.88s |  Obviously that's a lot of resources.
1636.88s - 1640.20s |  Not everyone has a 200 person product security team,
1640.20s - 1642.56s |  but if you have something that has not gone
1642.56s - 1644.12s |  through all those areas of due diligence
1644.12s - 1646.24s |  and you're going straight to making it
1646.24s - 1648.64s |  a valid bug bounty target, that's fine.
1648.64s - 1650.92s |  That is just probably the most expensive way
1650.92s - 1653.28s |  to get security improvements made
1653.28s - 1655.12s |  on that particular product.
1655.12s - 1658.56s |  At the same time, there's usually nothing academic
1659.16s - 1661.60s |  or, you know, not real once it's in production.
1661.60s - 1664.32s |  These are targeting customers now,
1664.32s - 1666.16s |  actively impacting them.
1666.16s - 1668.72s |  And again, it's not a theoretical or academic finding.
1668.72s - 1671.08s |  So usually there's movement to get it pushed out.
1671.08s - 1672.00s |  The other thing that I like doing,
1672.00s - 1673.76s |  if I get multiple reports of the same thing,
1673.76s - 1676.44s |  I treat that as an increased likelihood of exploitation.
1676.44s - 1678.68s |  So something, you know, if you get 10 different people
1678.68s - 1680.20s |  telling you a thing is coming in
1680.20s - 1681.88s |  and it's rated as a medium,
1681.88s - 1683.28s |  well, 10 different unique people can find it
1683.28s - 1684.28s |  if they're not sharing that information.
1684.28s - 1685.32s |  Maybe that should probably be a high
1685.32s - 1686.44s |  and we shouldn't kick that down the can
1686.44s - 1688.60s |  every three months as business accepted risk.
1688.60s - 1691.16s |  But basically it's kind of common sense stuff.
1691.16s - 1692.64s |  If you go straight to the bug bounty program,
1692.64s - 1693.64s |  that is the most expensive way
1693.64s - 1694.80s |  to identify vulnerabilities on it.
1694.80s - 1696.88s |  There'll probably be real good ones though.
1697.92s - 1699.64s |  It could be more cost effective to do something
1699.64s - 1701.60s |  a little bit more on the shift left sort of pipeline,
1701.60s - 1703.20s |  but it's just the reality of it.
1705.36s - 1707.32s |  Yeah, just to add to that a little bit,
1707.32s - 1709.56s |  I feel like if you're getting the same
1709.56s - 1711.12s |  critical vulnerabilities in every month,
1711.12s - 1713.68s |  then you're just paying that researcher's mortgage.
1714.52s - 1717.96s |  It's not like your role as a bug bounty program manager
1717.96s - 1720.08s |  should be to push the business
1720.08s - 1722.44s |  to do more comprehensive fixes for things
1722.44s - 1724.16s |  or to find every variance of this
1724.16s - 1727.44s |  or to introduce some additional scanning or something.
1728.64s - 1730.60s |  It's on you, the program manager to make that happen.
1730.60s - 1732.52s |  The researcher is just gonna keep submitting,
1732.52s - 1738.71s |  you know, they're not interested in the systematic fixes.
1738.71s - 1740.87s |  Yeah, I mean, like the shift left thing is,
1742.15s - 1743.15s |  you hear it all the time,
1743.15s - 1746.23s |  but like we're kind of stuck with the roadmap, right?
1746.23s - 1748.15s |  So whatever product is coming on the market
1748.15s - 1750.75s |  and those products are based on customer driven needs,
1750.75s - 1754.31s |  right, so customer wants this, this product is built,
1754.31s - 1756.15s |  the product goes through testing,
1756.15s - 1757.55s |  it gets internal red teams,
1757.55s - 1761.95s |  it gets lots of pen testing and security evaluations
1761.95s - 1763.91s |  and hackathons and whatever internally.
1763.91s - 1765.31s |  And then it gets on the market
1765.31s - 1766.83s |  and that's where VDP comes in place.
1766.83s - 1769.99s |  So vulnerability disclosure, which is not usually paid.
1769.99s - 1771.75s |  So that's your see something, say something.
1771.75s - 1775.35s |  And then and only then should it end up
1775.35s - 1777.55s |  in the bug bounty space.
1777.55s - 1780.63s |  So bug bounty is true adversary emulation in my mind.
1780.63s - 1782.15s |  And so you're looking at things
1782.15s - 1784.95s |  that are actively accessible,
1784.95s - 1789.35s |  but there are places where you can insert yourself
1789.35s - 1793.67s |  into that product lifecycle before it gets on the market.
1793.67s - 1795.87s |  If you have a good researcher base
1795.87s - 1797.43s |  that has really qualified
1797.43s - 1799.75s |  and really awesome researchers in that space
1799.79s - 1802.75s |  that align with that target or that product,
1802.75s - 1805.59s |  why not consider running a private bug bounty event
1805.59s - 1808.43s |  on that product before that product goes on the market?
1808.43s - 1810.63s |  You're likely to get really, really good results that way
1810.63s - 1813.19s |  because usually developers and hackers
1813.19s - 1814.15s |  have different mindsets.
1814.15s - 1816.71s |  Some are fixers and some are breakers.
1816.71s - 1818.91s |  And if you approach it from an adversary perspective,
1818.91s - 1820.83s |  like most bug hunters do,
1820.83s - 1823.63s |  you're likely to get really good results that way.
1823.63s - 1825.39s |  And then putting the bug hunters
1825.39s - 1827.63s |  and the engineers in the same room,
1827.63s - 1830.31s |  I've had really good results with that.
1830.31s - 1831.35s |  Just sit them next to each other
1831.35s - 1833.11s |  and let them challenge each other.
1833.11s - 1834.71s |  Works really well.
1836.43s - 1839.59s |  So then I can get those products fixed
1839.59s - 1841.47s |  before it ever even goes on the market.
1841.47s - 1842.99s |  And then at that point,
1843.87s - 1845.15s |  then it goes through the rest of the process.
1845.15s - 1846.87s |  Product gets launched on the market.
1846.87s - 1849.07s |  Problems have already been fixed.
1849.07s - 1850.15s |  Looks good for the company
1850.15s - 1851.67s |  because you don't have as many CVEs
1851.67s - 1854.83s |  or any negative reports or bad press.
1854.83s - 1857.19s |  Then product goes into VDP
1857.19s - 1859.07s |  and then it goes into bug hunting, right?
1859.07s - 1860.31s |  So bug bounty.
1860.31s - 1862.59s |  So I would say there are probably opportunities
1862.59s - 1866.75s |  to insert one's bug bounty program
1866.75s - 1868.91s |  into the product lifecycle.
1868.91s - 1873.87s |  But when you think about from a industry perspective,
1873.87s - 1876.51s |  there is a reason that you have a bug bounty program.
1876.51s - 1879.23s |  And that reason is so that you can
1879.23s - 1881.55s |  take those vulnerability reports that you get,
1881.55s - 1882.39s |  you can analyze them,
1882.39s - 1883.63s |  you can do trend analysis on them
1883.63s - 1886.99s |  and you can force them back into your SDL, right?
1887.75s - 1889.55s |  Your lifecycle, right?
1889.55s - 1892.87s |  You want to not have that same kind of vulnerability
1892.87s - 1895.71s |  pop up over and over again in succession
1895.71s - 1898.95s |  or in multiple products that use the same ingredients.
1898.95s - 1903.59s |  So if you don't do that part,
1903.59s - 1907.43s |  then the only people who suffer are the product engineers
1907.43s - 1909.67s |  who are having to manage the reports on the other end.
1909.67s - 1911.39s |  So it's really important to integrate
1911.39s - 1915.19s |  the bug bounty program back into the development lifecycle.
1915.19s - 1916.91s |  There are lots of ways to do that.
1917.75s - 1919.55s |  Chargebacks is one of my favorite.
1919.55s - 1922.83s |  For every payment that goes out to a bug hunter,
1922.83s - 1925.75s |  you charge back the business unit that owns that program.
1928.15s - 1929.31s |  So they feel the pain.
1929.31s - 1930.51s |  That's the point, right?
1932.35s - 1934.59s |  If you don't know me,
1934.59s - 1937.79s |  I've worked in this field for 20 something years.
1937.79s - 1940.39s |  I'm all out of carrots.
1940.39s - 1941.87s |  I only have sticks left.
1943.51s - 1946.67s |  So if the way to feel the pain
1947.43s - 1948.27s |  and to make the change
1948.27s - 1949.75s |  is going to be hitting someone's pocketbook
1949.75s - 1951.79s |  because that's what they understand,
1951.79s - 1953.59s |  then that's what I'm going to do.
1953.59s - 1956.51s |  So it's all about that completing that cycle, right?
1956.51s - 1959.79s |  If it gets to the end and you still have reports
1959.79s - 1962.31s |  and those reports are the same reports over and over again
1962.31s - 1963.83s |  or the same template,
1963.83s - 1966.19s |  like then that template,
1967.39s - 1969.67s |  that researcher is doing the same thing over and over again.
1969.67s - 1972.67s |  They're finding multiple problems in multiple products
1972.67s - 1974.51s |  and we're playing whack-a-mole to fix it.
1974.51s - 1976.71s |  That's not a good way to do it.
1976.71s - 1978.71s |  So that needs to go back to the red team.
1978.71s - 1981.03s |  The red team needs to go and fix all of those problems
1981.03s - 1983.87s |  and all of those products and all of those ingredients.
1983.87s - 1985.71s |  And they need to be forced to do that sometimes.
1985.71s - 1987.43s |  So it's all about integrating
1987.43s - 1991.27s |  and making sure that you're adequately using incentives,
1991.27s - 1993.83s |  both on your bug side and on your internal side.
1995.75s - 1996.59s |  You know, real quick,
1996.59s - 1997.55s |  you mentioned that there's only pain involved,
1997.55s - 1998.99s |  but I don't think that's pain from the bug hunter
1998.99s - 2001.15s |  who is getting, you know,
2001.15s - 2003.31s |  30 different duplicates sent across different targets
2003.35s - 2005.43s |  and, you know, fishing for that payout 30X,
2005.43s - 2009.23s |  which sometimes it's valid, sometimes it's not.
2009.23s - 2010.07s |  What do you think?
2010.07s - 2013.07s |  It's pain whenever they've submitted 30 reports
2013.07s - 2013.91s |  of the same,
2013.91s - 2015.67s |  they did the same thing 30 times
2015.67s - 2017.03s |  and got 30 different issues
2017.03s - 2019.19s |  and then my team got wise to it
2019.19s - 2024.03s |  and went back and did their due diligence on all products.
2024.03s - 2026.99s |  And then suddenly that pipe has just dried up,
2026.99s - 2027.91s |  which is ideal.
2027.91s - 2029.71s |  That's what we want.
2029.71s - 2032.39s |  So just to bring it back to bug bounty meta,
2032.39s - 2033.51s |  something that I've done before,
2033.51s - 2035.91s |  when I've identified that you can find vulnerabilities
2035.91s - 2038.03s |  on let's say 30 different products,
2038.03s - 2040.27s |  do I submit all 30 or do I submit two?
2041.15s - 2042.83s |  And then once those two get paid out,
2042.83s - 2044.67s |  do I submit two more?
2044.67s - 2045.51s |  And so-
2047.07s - 2048.91s |  No, submit 30, because if you submit-
2048.91s - 2050.31s |  I get one payout.
2050.31s - 2051.71s |  No, not necessarily.
2051.71s - 2052.75s |  It depends on the product.
2052.75s - 2054.23s |  It depends on the program.
2054.23s - 2057.95s |  But if you submit two and then you wait,
2057.95s - 2059.95s |  you've now given my engineers time
2059.95s - 2063.47s |  to fix the product in all the products,
2063.47s - 2065.67s |  which means those 28 you were holding onto
2065.67s - 2067.15s |  are no longer valid.
2067.15s - 2068.83s |  So I'm going to jump in for one second,
2068.83s - 2069.67s |  because this is the-
2069.67s - 2070.51s |  I'm so sorry.
2070.51s - 2072.35s |  No, this is the perfect segue.
2072.35s - 2075.47s |  So talking about different ways to approach this,
2075.47s - 2077.27s |  from both perspectives,
2077.27s - 2080.07s |  what qualities do the best programs for this have?
2080.07s - 2082.03s |  How are you doing that sort of dupe detection?
2082.03s - 2083.35s |  How are you playing that game?
2083.35s - 2085.75s |  And how are you finding the targets that you want?
2085.75s - 2087.63s |  And Katie, since I cut you off,
2087.63s - 2089.47s |  you're the first person to take this one.
2089.99s - 2090.83s |  Oh, Lord.
2090.83s - 2091.67s |  Okay.
2091.67s - 2093.15s |  What qualities?
2093.15s - 2093.99s |  Oh.
2095.55s - 2097.79s |  Well, now my train of thought's interrupted.
2098.79s - 2100.39s |  Just cause help me out.
2100.39s - 2102.07s |  Yeah, no problem.
2102.07s - 2104.83s |  So I think the general mantra for a program manager
2104.83s - 2107.39s |  is to allocate budget towards the areas
2107.39s - 2109.51s |  that you want to reinforce behavior for.
2109.51s - 2112.63s |  So that can mean a couple of different things
2112.63s - 2114.91s |  that are situational based on the bugs that are coming in.
2114.91s - 2117.31s |  So if I'm running a program
2117.31s - 2120.15s |  and one person has submitted like a template vulnerability,
2120.15s - 2122.71s |  let's say that I own a lot of infrastructure on the internet
2122.71s - 2125.27s |  and they found something that applies
2125.27s - 2127.15s |  to a whole lot of those things,
2128.31s - 2131.87s |  I would appreciate knowing all of them at once
2131.87s - 2133.19s |  as a bug value program manager.
2133.19s - 2135.11s |  But I also realize that,
2135.11s - 2137.23s |  hey, this person could have given me one
2137.23s - 2139.75s |  and I may have paid them the same.
2139.75s - 2141.83s |  And so I think you need to reinforce the behavior
2141.83s - 2142.67s |  that you want to see.
2142.67s - 2144.19s |  So if this is a good high quality researcher
2144.19s - 2146.35s |  who gives great reports,
2146.35s - 2149.51s |  they respond back to you quickly, they're friendly.
2150.39s - 2151.43s |  If you have the budget for it,
2151.43s - 2152.95s |  pay them a multiple for what it is.
2152.95s - 2155.99s |  Find a way to make whole based on the effort
2155.99s - 2157.99s |  that they put into finding the thing.
2157.99s - 2160.07s |  And I think you can often see based on the report comes in
2160.07s - 2161.91s |  like did someone run a scanner for 30 minutes
2161.91s - 2164.27s |  and stumble across something that is interesting
2164.27s - 2165.47s |  and something we'd still need to fix
2165.47s - 2168.31s |  or did this require them going down the rabbit hole
2168.31s - 2169.47s |  for two particular weeks
2169.47s - 2170.63s |  and then they found something really cool
2170.63s - 2172.63s |  but maybe it's a one to many situation.
2173.51s - 2174.91s |  And not everyone has an infinite budget
2174.91s - 2175.99s |  so it's a little sticky there.
2176.51s - 2178.79s |  But they probably deserve more than a 1x payout.
2178.79s - 2183.23s |  Is it 2x, 4x, 8x, 20x, half of what they submitted.
2184.11s - 2185.59s |  I think it's more important that you're fair
2185.59s - 2188.03s |  and that good faith behavior goes both ways,
2188.03s - 2189.99s |  both as the researcher who's submitting the bug
2189.99s - 2191.15s |  and saying, hey, I found a thing,
2191.15s - 2193.43s |  I would like something for what has been done,
2193.43s - 2194.83s |  especially if you're gonna make a code fix change
2194.83s - 2195.83s |  for any of that.
2195.83s - 2197.31s |  I think that's the general mantra.
2197.31s - 2199.23s |  You submit a bug, they make some change,
2199.23s - 2200.87s |  it's in scope, you should pay out.
2200.87s - 2201.71s |  Heal the dial.
2203.63s - 2205.39s |  But from the program manager's standpoint,
2205.39s - 2206.35s |  it's gonna depend on your budget.
2206.35s - 2209.23s |  You can't also just bleed everything instantly
2209.23s - 2210.59s |  because of this one thing that came by
2210.59s - 2212.07s |  because you might have a couple more quarters
2212.07s - 2213.31s |  or the rest of the year to get through.
2213.31s - 2215.31s |  So you have to also be the king
2215.31s - 2217.15s |  that's managing your resources effectively as well
2217.15s - 2219.55s |  for your kingdom that is this bug bounty program.
2220.79s - 2222.31s |  How's that for seeding and starting it off?
2222.31s - 2224.31s |  I appreciate that, yeah.
2224.31s - 2226.59s |  So the best programs that I've seen
2226.59s - 2228.27s |  are programs that are responsive,
2228.27s - 2229.87s |  that have interesting targets,
2229.87s - 2232.91s |  that triage quickly, pay people quickly.
2232.91s - 2233.95s |  I've seen a lot of programs
2233.95s - 2238.03s |  that don't really, they're kind of just templated, right?
2238.03s - 2241.75s |  They just took some, I don't mean to bash the platforms,
2241.75s - 2244.27s |  but they just did what the platform said
2244.27s - 2246.23s |  and followed that box,
2246.23s - 2249.59s |  but they never really thought about what is my product
2249.59s - 2251.79s |  and then what is the skillset that's needed
2251.79s - 2253.11s |  in order to hack my product
2253.11s - 2257.27s |  and then how do I efficiently incentivize those skillsets?
2257.27s - 2259.63s |  So I think there is something to the human element.
2259.63s - 2261.99s |  There's multiple kinds of researchers out there.
2261.99s - 2263.39s |  You have your traditional bug hunters
2263.83s - 2264.91s |  that are motivated by the cash payout.
2264.91s - 2268.83s |  They're gonna be happy to lob a report over the fence
2268.83s - 2271.71s |  and as long as they get paid, they don't care.
2271.71s - 2272.63s |  They're not gonna bother you
2272.63s - 2274.87s |  about disclosure windows or anything else.
2274.87s - 2276.39s |  Then you have recognition seekers
2276.39s - 2278.51s |  and I don't mean that negatively,
2278.51s - 2279.79s |  but I mean people who are like,
2279.79s - 2281.95s |  typically we see this in academics, right?
2281.95s - 2284.31s |  Academics often can't accept a bounty anyway,
2284.31s - 2285.55s |  so they don't care.
2285.55s - 2288.15s |  They care about, can I talk about this at a conference?
2288.15s - 2290.55s |  Am I gonna get my name next to a CBE for this?
2290.55s - 2291.83s |  They are looking for that,
2291.83s - 2296.83s |  how do I make sure that I'm able to build my resume,
2297.15s - 2300.55s |  build my street cred based on my research, right?
2300.55s - 2302.19s |  So your academics are gonna be,
2302.19s - 2304.31s |  or your recognition seekers are gonna be different
2304.31s - 2305.19s |  than your bug hunters.
2305.19s - 2307.15s |  They're gonna be motivated by different things.
2307.15s - 2309.67s |  You have friendly helpers as we call them,
2309.67s - 2311.63s |  so that's like government agencies
2311.63s - 2313.03s |  or sometimes other companies.
2313.03s - 2315.07s |  So sometimes my technology
2315.07s - 2317.79s |  is similar to my competitor's technology
2317.79s - 2321.03s |  and if I get a report that I know
2321.03s - 2323.71s |  that impacts my competitor, I tell them.
2325.47s - 2328.35s |  We have a number, we call the bat line
2328.35s - 2330.27s |  and we say, hey other company,
2330.27s - 2332.47s |  this impacts me and it probably impacts you too
2332.47s - 2333.51s |  and they do the same.
2333.51s - 2335.83s |  So those are kind of like friendly helpers, right?
2335.83s - 2339.23s |  Well, so each one of those different kinds of motivations
2339.23s - 2341.39s |  often requires a different kind of incentive.
2341.39s - 2343.91s |  So there's different things that you can do as a program
2343.91s - 2346.71s |  to incentivize the skillset that you want
2346.71s - 2348.11s |  and the results that you want.
2348.11s - 2349.79s |  Payouts is one of them.
2349.79s - 2350.87s |  The other things that you can do
2350.87s - 2355.87s |  are things like we call it CPEs for CVEs, right?
2356.11s - 2358.27s |  So continuing education credits, right?
2358.27s - 2360.35s |  Like a lot of people have certifications
2360.35s - 2363.87s |  and if you find a CVE, it's very easy for me
2363.87s - 2367.51s |  as a bug bounty manager to literally write out a certificate
2367.51s - 2369.87s |  for that bug hunter and they can take that back
2369.87s - 2373.79s |  to whoever owns their, whether it's EC council
2373.79s - 2376.39s |  or ISACA or whoever owns that certification
2376.39s - 2378.59s |  and they can get continuing education credits
2378.59s - 2379.75s |  for the work that they do.
2380.59s - 2383.67s |  That's gonna motivate some people more than the payout will.
2384.59s - 2386.19s |  Working with researchers to make sure
2386.19s - 2387.75s |  that their timelines are met so they can talk
2387.75s - 2389.67s |  at a conference or working with them
2389.67s - 2392.43s |  to help improve their overall talk at a conference
2392.43s - 2393.99s |  or working with them to help them improve
2393.99s - 2397.99s |  their paper that's gonna get published.
2397.99s - 2402.27s |  Those things are specific incentives that you can do
2402.27s - 2405.39s |  to make sure that you're getting the quality results.
2405.39s - 2408.83s |  So I think that the best bug bounty programs are responsive.
2408.83s - 2411.03s |  They're responsive to the needs of the product
2411.03s - 2414.03s |  and they're responsive to the needs of the researchers
2414.03s - 2416.03s |  or the constituents that they want
2416.03s - 2417.35s |  to get those results from.
2417.35s - 2419.91s |  It's all about figuring out what that balance is.
2422.31s - 2423.79s |  Just to use like some concrete examples,
2423.79s - 2425.83s |  maybe like as a program manager,
2425.83s - 2428.43s |  like do you know who your top bug bounty hunters are?
2429.43s - 2431.11s |  Like what motivates them?
2431.11s - 2432.31s |  Why are they there?
2432.31s - 2434.87s |  And then similarly as a program manager,
2434.87s - 2437.99s |  like do you know what matters to the business?
2437.99s - 2442.71s |  Like going beyond CV or CVSS score, sorry.
2442.71s - 2447.23s |  Like what is a crit to your business?
2447.23s - 2451.62s |  And it's not always RCE necessarily.
2451.62s - 2453.74s |  Yeah, bonuses are delightful too.
2453.74s - 2456.02s |  Just because like sometimes you get locked
2456.02s - 2459.22s |  in this like legal world where there's a definition
2459.22s - 2462.14s |  of the word bounty and you can have a bounty schedule
2462.14s - 2464.58s |  but your legal won't let you change
2464.58s - 2466.82s |  from what that bounty definition is
2466.82s - 2468.30s |  because it's tied to a specific thing
2468.30s - 2469.14s |  and it's tied to like,
2469.14s - 2470.94s |  what is the definition of vulnerability?
2470.94s - 2474.62s |  So you can be creative sometimes with payouts on things
2474.62s - 2477.90s |  like if you change, kind of change the definition
2477.90s - 2481.66s |  and say this may not be a traditional vulnerability
2481.66s - 2484.02s |  which equals a CVE, which equals this payout
2484.02s - 2486.38s |  based on criticality, which is our process.
2486.38s - 2489.46s |  You can sometimes say like based on budget,
2491.02s - 2494.14s |  will my company take action based on this report, right?
2494.14s - 2495.42s |  That's a guiding principle.
2495.42s - 2497.66s |  And you can say, if my company will take action
2497.66s - 2500.58s |  based on this report, then this report has value to me
2500.58s - 2503.06s |  and then I have a set bonus scale.
2503.06s - 2505.14s |  Like to what level will my company take action
2505.14s - 2506.06s |  on this report?
2506.06s - 2508.02s |  Will my company put out a document change
2508.02s - 2510.14s |  and suddenly change the way
2510.14s - 2512.74s |  that the security guidance is applied?
2512.74s - 2514.90s |  Well, that might be worth a certain amount of money
2514.90s - 2517.82s |  and that's a bonus payment I can pay to that researcher
2517.82s - 2519.90s |  because I appreciate their,
2519.90s - 2524.62s |  I appreciate the work that they put into finding that issue,
2524.62s - 2527.42s |  security issue and sending it to me.
2528.18s - 2529.02s |  And so now I can fix something
2529.02s - 2530.22s |  that I didn't know was a problem
2530.22s - 2532.70s |  even if it's not a traditional patch.
2532.70s - 2534.90s |  So I think you should be creative
2534.90s - 2537.06s |  in the ways that you think about
2537.06s - 2540.02s |  what is a security harm versus a vulnerability
2540.02s - 2543.06s |  and how do we reward positive behavior?
2544.14s - 2546.94s |  Slag motivates, it helps.
2549.21s - 2550.37s |  All right, thank you.
2550.37s - 2553.41s |  So hopping on, sort of touching back
2553.41s - 2555.37s |  on something Kuzco had mentioned earlier
2555.37s - 2557.45s |  and something we've had a few talks on at DEF CON
2557.49s - 2559.77s |  and AppSec Village and whatnot in the past.
2559.77s - 2562.09s |  And yes, we did skip a question.
2562.09s - 2564.41s |  What are your thoughts on bounty farming?
2564.41s - 2566.57s |  And if you had to put a specific definition
2566.57s - 2568.89s |  or your spin on bounty farming,
2568.89s - 2571.09s |  what would you qualify it as?
2572.37s - 2573.85s |  And Kuzco, this one's you to start.
2573.85s - 2575.01s |  All right.
2575.01s - 2577.49s |  So does anyone here not know what bounty farming is?
2577.49s - 2579.01s |  Just think of the terminology.
2579.01s - 2580.93s |  Okay, so let's say that you have a platform
2580.93s - 2583.21s |  that is vulnerable to a particular thing
2583.21s - 2585.93s |  and that platform is like a business to business
2585.93s - 2586.77s |  sort of thing.
2586.77s - 2588.25s |  So they themselves have customers
2588.25s - 2589.41s |  who are using that platform.
2589.41s - 2592.45s |  Those customers roll it out for their clients to use.
2592.45s - 2595.01s |  And so if the vulnerability exists in the platform,
2596.05s - 2597.85s |  should I be reporting that vulnerability
2597.85s - 2599.01s |  to the main parent company
2599.01s - 2600.53s |  or to all the child companies who are running it
2600.53s - 2602.57s |  who may have their own security teams?
2602.57s - 2604.69s |  And so when that happens, you end up in this situation.
2604.69s - 2606.85s |  And so again, one to many.
2606.85s - 2611.25s |  And so who is responsible for paying that bounty?
2611.25s - 2613.85s |  My personal thought is that the most,
2613.85s - 2615.45s |  at least when we're talking about like the fundamentals
2615.45s - 2617.13s |  of what happened, you've identified a risk,
2617.13s - 2618.21s |  you've reported the risk,
2618.21s - 2620.09s |  and does the entity that you're reporting to
2620.09s - 2621.61s |  agree that it is a risk?
2621.61s - 2623.09s |  Sometimes there's semantics involved.
2623.09s - 2624.49s |  We try to do what we can with prioritization
2624.49s - 2626.33s |  and threat levels and just something to convey
2626.33s - 2629.21s |  across the aisle of if something is bad, how bad is it?
2629.21s - 2632.01s |  And obviously the game in this is we want to
2633.29s - 2635.09s |  explain the situation in such a way
2635.09s - 2638.57s |  to where the damages are material and we can remediate it.
2638.57s - 2640.49s |  If that company pushes a line of code
2640.49s - 2643.81s |  or changes configuration in response to what you've provided,
2643.81s - 2645.01s |  I think that most people will agree
2645.53s - 2647.45s |  that that person has earned a reward,
2647.45s - 2649.21s |  whatever the reward may be.
2649.21s - 2651.13s |  If they have a budget, spend the budget towards it.
2651.13s - 2652.41s |  They don't have a budget, at the very least,
2652.41s - 2655.57s |  some swag of some sort, or I've done vulnerabilities
2655.57s - 2657.17s |  or I've reported vulnerabilities in place
2657.17s - 2659.05s |  just so that I could be on like a thank you page
2659.05s - 2660.13s |  on their website.
2660.13s - 2662.13s |  Building the CV is material too for you.
2664.17s - 2666.61s |  Someone should pay and it's unfortunate
2666.61s - 2669.49s |  when there becomes conflict there between who it is,
2669.49s - 2671.01s |  especially when you have platforms
2671.01s - 2674.25s |  who often shift something out in a secure by default way,
2674.25s - 2676.01s |  or at least they've done their best attempt
2676.01s - 2677.81s |  at secure by default.
2677.81s - 2680.41s |  The customer of that particular platform gets it
2680.41s - 2682.41s |  and they change settings so that their users
2682.41s - 2683.57s |  can log into it easier.
2683.57s - 2686.25s |  A great example is a lack of 2FA.
2686.25s - 2688.77s |  So, and I don't want to name any particular platforms,
2688.77s - 2691.45s |  you know, just think, there's a lot of them.
2691.45s - 2693.29s |  Let's say that it shifts with 2FA enabled
2693.29s - 2695.73s |  and a strong password complexity.
2695.73s - 2697.69s |  That gets to the client who's buying
2697.69s - 2699.65s |  that particular platform and let's say
2699.65s - 2701.93s |  that that client has a non-technical user base.
2701.93s - 2704.49s |  Those user base don't want to use 2FA
2704.49s - 2706.13s |  or they don't want to use password managers
2706.13s - 2707.21s |  for high entropy passwords.
2707.21s - 2708.53s |  And so now you end up with a situation
2708.53s - 2710.29s |  where you can have eight lowercase characters
2710.29s - 2711.85s |  as an extreme for a password.
2711.85s - 2713.73s |  And some bug bounty hunter is saying,
2713.73s - 2715.21s |  hey, there's low password entropy here
2715.21s - 2718.25s |  on this particular authentication mechanism.
2718.25s - 2719.97s |  That particular instance is Vuln,
2719.97s - 2721.61s |  the main parent company for it,
2721.61s - 2723.45s |  shipped it out by secure by default.
2725.65s - 2727.57s |  They could have many child companies
2727.57s - 2728.45s |  that are all doing this.
2728.45s - 2731.37s |  And so there is a vulnerability there, but is it really?
2731.37s - 2733.05s |  We get to the semantics argument.
2733.05s - 2734.73s |  And when you find that situation,
2734.73s - 2736.09s |  and I found that situation,
2736.09s - 2737.25s |  when I'm typing up the report,
2737.25s - 2738.21s |  I almost have to ask myself,
2738.21s - 2740.73s |  how much do I want to spend in my time and effort
2740.73s - 2743.33s |  arguing that it is something that should be changed,
2744.45s - 2747.49s |  especially if that particular business is doing it
2747.49s - 2749.09s |  such that they can have customers
2749.09s - 2750.97s |  that use their platform a little bit more.
2750.97s - 2753.61s |  So there's a lot of nuance there.
2753.61s - 2755.21s |  I think that it goes back fundamentally
2755.21s - 2757.41s |  to being accepting of people
2757.41s - 2758.89s |  who are gonna bring risk to you
2758.89s - 2760.45s |  and then figuring out what you can do about it.
2760.45s - 2763.33s |  If there has to be some sort of discussion
2763.33s - 2765.37s |  between that particular client and the parent company
2765.37s - 2766.81s |  on who's gonna pay out for it,
2766.81s - 2767.85s |  unfortunately it needs to be had
2767.85s - 2770.17s |  and not everyone has those dialogues for it.
2770.17s - 2772.05s |  At best, sometimes you have customer service rep
2772.05s - 2775.69s |  from node one talking to customer service rep from node two.
2775.69s - 2777.85s |  Maybe one of them only has access to the security company
2777.85s - 2779.69s |  and there's just so much red tape in the way
2779.69s - 2781.29s |  that you're not gonna get a practical solution
2781.29s - 2782.97s |  in any meaningful amount of time.
2782.97s - 2783.93s |  So what ends up happening
2783.93s - 2785.93s |  is that that bounty researcher is frustrated.
2785.93s - 2787.33s |  They feel like they've spent a whole lot of effort
2787.33s - 2788.49s |  on something, or maybe they haven't,
2788.49s - 2789.69s |  but they still typed up the report
2789.89s - 2792.25s |  and brought something to your attention.
2792.25s - 2794.97s |  I don't think we have anyone who really says that,
2794.97s - 2797.81s |  or I haven't seen, like a thing was shipped to us
2797.81s - 2801.05s |  in this secure by default way and then we've changed it.
2801.05s - 2801.89s |  And we're not going to
2801.89s - 2804.25s |  because it's part of how our business operates.
2804.25s - 2805.09s |  I've seen that.
2805.09s - 2805.93s |  Have you?
2805.93s - 2808.97s |  Yeah, because, and so I sit on the CVE board
2808.97s - 2811.53s |  just for full disclosure there.
2811.53s - 2815.05s |  So I've been the CVE board member for 10 years.
2815.93s - 2818.37s |  And when we get into like traditional definition
2818.41s - 2819.77s |  of what is a vulnerability,
2819.77s - 2821.61s |  what you're describing is a misconfiguration
2821.61s - 2822.57s |  and not a vulnerability.
2822.57s - 2825.41s |  And so some companies will say that's a misconfiguration
2825.41s - 2827.77s |  and not a vulnerability because it was,
2827.77s - 2831.85s |  the device is operating as intended.
2831.85s - 2834.49s |  It's a shit secure practice, like security practice.
2834.49s - 2837.05s |  Like it's not a good practice,
2837.05s - 2839.97s |  but it was set up that way to be that way
2839.97s - 2842.01s |  because the customer wanted it that way.
2842.01s - 2845.17s |  And that's the implementation of the device, not the device.
2845.17s - 2846.97s |  So yeah, I've seen that.
2846.97s - 2848.01s |  Okay, so let's say it's not a,
2848.01s - 2849.37s |  let's get to something more practical.
2849.37s - 2853.77s |  I'm like, okay, it's not a misconfiguration.
2853.77s - 2854.73s |  The products have been shipped out.
2854.73s - 2855.57s |  People are using it.
2855.57s - 2857.13s |  And let's just say it's like cross-site scripting
2857.13s - 2858.05s |  on the login page.
2858.05s - 2859.93s |  So, you know, improper username,
2859.93s - 2861.05s |  the username comes back reflected
2861.05s - 2862.53s |  with whatever input the user gave it.
2862.53s - 2863.61s |  And so now every instance,
2863.61s - 2864.97s |  every installation of this is vulnerable
2864.97s - 2866.21s |  to this particular thing.
2867.53s - 2868.37s |  What's that?
2868.37s - 2869.29s |  Still a misconfiguration.
2869.29s - 2870.37s |  Still a misconfiguration.
2870.37s - 2876.39s |  Okay, well, let's say that.
2876.39s - 2877.43s |  Log for chair.
2877.43s - 2878.35s |  Apache zero day.
2879.47s - 2883.51s |  All of those, but something more tangible
2883.51s - 2884.99s |  that affects all the different installations.
2884.99s - 2887.79s |  And so each one should be racing to fix it,
2887.79s - 2889.43s |  but they're likely going to have different security,
2889.43s - 2891.15s |  maturity mechanisms.
2891.15s - 2893.15s |  The fastest way for something like that to get fixed,
2893.15s - 2894.51s |  especially in a zero day situation
2894.51s - 2897.43s |  is that the parent company fixes it at the platform level.
2897.43s - 2899.23s |  And then that is automatically cascading down
2899.23s - 2901.79s |  to everyone who has their own installations of it.
2901.79s - 2903.43s |  Unless those are too custom
2903.43s - 2904.71s |  such that it can't accept the update.
2904.71s - 2907.07s |  And I've seen that happen before too.
2907.11s - 2909.27s |  In that situation, my personal opinion
2909.27s - 2911.19s |  is that the parent company should pay for it.
2911.19s - 2912.71s |  But then again, at that same time,
2912.71s - 2916.47s |  is this a one-to-many payout or is it a one-to-one?
2916.47s - 2918.35s |  Because like, let's say that you reporting
2918.35s - 2919.51s |  this vulnerability to the parent company
2919.51s - 2922.23s |  has fixed a thousand different installations
2922.23s - 2923.43s |  and you wanted to have the argument
2923.43s - 2924.91s |  that this was like a thousand SQL injections
2924.91s - 2926.27s |  or a thousand RCEs.
2929.41s - 2931.69s |  So like, at least my view on this anyways
2931.69s - 2934.49s |  is like if you're, if you find it,
2934.49s - 2935.53s |  using Apache as an example,
2935.53s - 2937.21s |  if you find a zero day on Apache,
2937.21s - 2938.05s |  I want to hear about it
2938.33s - 2939.65s |  because it impacts my products.
2939.65s - 2942.77s |  If you're reporting like a one day
2942.77s - 2944.29s |  as in like something that's been,
2944.29s - 2945.61s |  a CV has been issued for it
2945.61s - 2946.93s |  and a patch has been published
2946.93s - 2949.25s |  and we have to go pick up the patch,
2949.25s - 2951.17s |  it's probably already in our pipeline.
2952.25s - 2954.81s |  I like policies where, or I like programs
2954.81s - 2957.01s |  where there's like a 30 day window essentially
2957.01s - 2958.93s |  where the program has a chance to fix things
2958.93s - 2960.41s |  and then they can go and,
2960.41s - 2961.89s |  you can go and report something
2961.89s - 2963.69s |  after a certain amount of time.
2963.69s - 2965.09s |  But for like original research,
2965.09s - 2968.05s |  like I think part of bug bounty
2968.05s - 2969.85s |  is to incentivize that.
2969.85s - 2971.01s |  That's my view anyways.
2972.13s - 2973.57s |  Yeah, I'd say it comes down to
2973.57s - 2975.93s |  how well was your program terms written, right?
2975.93s - 2978.41s |  So every company is running a bug bounty program
2978.41s - 2980.81s |  should take the time to look at their product
2980.81s - 2982.77s |  and look at their bug bounty terms.
2982.77s - 2984.45s |  And if you have something,
2984.45s - 2986.73s |  I mean, you can eliminate those one to one,
2986.73s - 2989.69s |  one to many by simply saying that like,
2989.69s - 2992.81s |  the vulnerability is tied to the vulnerable code,
2992.81s - 2995.85s |  not how many instances of the vulnerable code exist.
2995.85s - 2999.33s |  So you root cause it basically,
2999.33s - 3002.13s |  but you need to make that real clear in your terms
3002.13s - 3005.17s |  well before someone comes to you with that problem.
3005.17s - 3009.37s |  So, and that is something that can be thought about
3009.37s - 3010.37s |  real early on.
3010.37s - 3011.49s |  It shouldn't be a surprise.
3011.49s - 3014.05s |  You shouldn't get a researcher submitting 100 tickets
3014.05s - 3016.57s |  for the same kind of problem
3016.57s - 3018.29s |  that roots down to one.
3018.29s - 3019.13s |  Submit all your tickets.
3019.13s - 3020.93s |  Don't hold, don't do two at a time.
3020.93s - 3024.41s |  All you're doing is screwing yourself
3024.41s - 3026.21s |  because it goes by the day.
3026.21s - 3027.49s |  I'm telling you, all you're doing is screwing yourself.
3027.49s - 3030.13s |  If you give me 30 tickets and they're all different,
3030.13s - 3031.41s |  substantially different on my page,
3031.41s - 3032.73s |  they're one of those tickets.
3032.73s - 3034.61s |  If you hold them and then I fix that problem
3034.61s - 3037.05s |  and I've just negated your entire research
3037.05s - 3038.41s |  that you had on 28 other tickets,
3038.41s - 3039.85s |  give them to me now.
3039.85s - 3041.05s |  Give me all the tickets.
3042.37s - 3047.01s |  But it, yeah, I think the program terms
3047.01s - 3047.89s |  are really important, right?
3047.89s - 3049.69s |  So like thinking through your use cases
3049.69s - 3051.53s |  and thinking through like this could happen
3051.53s - 3053.61s |  and I need to be very clear with my researchers
3053.61s - 3055.37s |  before they ever start working on my product
3055.37s - 3056.97s |  that these are the terms that are gonna get paid out
3056.97s - 3059.57s |  and I can't be changing the game halfway through
3059.57s - 3061.01s |  after they've submitted a report.
3061.01s - 3062.33s |  Like that's not cool.
3062.33s - 3063.17s |  That's not kosher.
3063.17s - 3064.17s |  You don't do that.
3064.17s - 3065.01s |  They submitted the report.
3065.01s - 3067.33s |  You pay the report under the terms that currently exist.
3067.33s - 3068.61s |  You change your terms later.
3068.61s - 3069.77s |  Well, then you have a cutoff date.
3069.77s - 3071.61s |  You say anything comes past this time
3071.61s - 3073.45s |  is gonna be subject to these terms.
3073.45s - 3074.61s |  But if you submitted it before,
3074.61s - 3075.45s |  then you fall.
3075.45s - 3076.81s |  Like it's just being fair and being honest
3076.81s - 3077.65s |  and being decent.
3077.65s - 3078.89s |  So you build that trust.
3078.93s - 3080.85s |  You don't have that trust then.
3080.85s - 3083.01s |  Why would a researcher submit the vulnerability to you
3083.01s - 3083.93s |  and not sell it?
3084.93s - 3087.01s |  So do the right thing and build trust.
3087.89s - 3090.25s |  So again, because the title of this whole panel
3090.25s - 3091.81s |  is the realities of bug bounty life,
3091.81s - 3095.21s |  I wanna go back to what are my,
3095.21s - 3096.57s |  what are the realities?
3096.57s - 3098.77s |  What are my incentives to actually report this
3098.77s - 3100.61s |  to the main parent program,
3100.61s - 3101.81s |  which let's say, okay,
3101.81s - 3103.33s |  they're either gonna pay nothing
3103.33s - 3106.17s |  or they'll treat it as one valid unique thing.
3106.17s - 3107.73s |  And they luck out by fixing it
3107.77s - 3109.01s |  and it fixes all the other,
3109.01s - 3111.49s |  multiple installations that are wrong
3111.49s - 3112.53s |  or incorrect rather.
3112.53s - 3113.37s |  Not wrong.
3113.37s - 3114.21s |  Security is hard to do.
3114.21s - 3116.45s |  We wanna be very blameless about remediation.
3119.05s - 3121.37s |  I can either not get paid or get paid
3121.37s - 3122.93s |  or maybe get paid a multiple
3122.93s - 3124.77s |  if I submit it to the parent company.
3124.77s - 3127.45s |  If they have a child company who's using that platform
3127.45s - 3128.93s |  and they have a particular,
3128.93s - 3129.77s |  they have a security team,
3129.77s - 3130.61s |  I could submit it to them
3130.61s - 3131.89s |  and the exact same thing may happen.
3131.89s - 3132.81s |  Read the terms.
3132.81s - 3133.65s |  Read the terms.
3133.65s - 3134.49s |  And I should read the terms.
3134.49s - 3135.37s |  And get as many vulnerability
3136.05s - 3137.25s |  companions as you can.
3137.25s - 3138.49s |  Read all the terms.
3138.49s - 3140.45s |  I promise, I'm getting at this.
3140.45s - 3142.29s |  We as BlackBounty program managers,
3142.29s - 3144.01s |  look, we know who's bounty farming.
3144.01s - 3144.97s |  We talk to each other.
3144.97s - 3146.17s |  We're all doing the same thing.
3146.17s - 3148.17s |  And if you submit a vulnerability
3148.17s - 3149.69s |  to 10 different security programs
3149.69s - 3152.05s |  that is all basically the same thing,
3152.05s - 3153.05s |  I'm just gonna throw WordPress out there
3153.05s - 3154.65s |  because there's a million WordPress installations
3154.65s - 3156.09s |  and nearly every company is using it to some degree.
3156.09s - 3157.61s |  If you find a WordPress vulnerability,
3157.61s - 3158.89s |  instead of submitting it to WordPress,
3158.89s - 3162.01s |  and instead you submit it to a company who's using it,
3162.01s - 3162.85s |  they may pay out.
3162.85s - 3163.69s |  This one may pay out.
3163.69s - 3164.53s |  This one may pay out.
3164.53s - 3165.37s |  And the next thing you know,
3165.37s - 3167.57s |  we're like, hey, I'm getting all this reports for WordPress.
3167.57s - 3169.05s |  Oh, I got that too.
3169.05s - 3170.75s |  Oh, this person is bounty farming.
3172.21s - 3174.29s |  We understand why it happens.
3174.29s - 3176.75s |  But also, I don't think you're gonna win any good favors
3176.75s - 3179.05s |  with the people who are inviting you to programs
3179.05s - 3181.29s |  who are trying to create good targets for you.
3181.29s - 3183.17s |  And so intent really is everything there.
3183.17s - 3184.91s |  And it should be both ways.
3184.91s - 3186.17s |  Both from the researcher side,
3186.17s - 3187.41s |  it's probably an unethical thing to do.
3187.41s - 3188.95s |  But again, it is the reality.
3188.95s - 3189.79s |  It probably happens.
3189.79s - 3191.61s |  Also, they might be younger in their career
3191.61s - 3194.29s |  and not know there's a parent company doing it.
3195.05s - 3198.65s |  Let's use single sign-on, for instance.
3198.65s - 3199.49s |  And they've found an issue
3199.49s - 3200.85s |  with a particular single sign-on instance
3200.85s - 3202.57s |  for one particular product,
3202.57s - 3204.89s |  not knowing that it's Okta behind the scenes or something.
3204.89s - 3206.65s |  It's not always very apparent.
3206.65s - 3209.37s |  It often is, but it doesn't have to be.
3209.37s - 3210.65s |  How do they know that that should go
3210.65s - 3212.53s |  to the main SSO provider?
3212.53s - 3215.61s |  And so I think it comes down to giving them an opportunity
3215.61s - 3216.93s |  to just state their case.
3216.93s - 3218.13s |  And if they've found a multiple thing
3218.13s - 3221.01s |  that applies to many things, that's fine.
3221.01s - 3223.17s |  I know someone who knows some really cool exploits
3223.17s - 3226.49s |  with headless Chrome browsers.
3226.49s - 3228.13s |  And so anywhere where he sees that feature
3228.13s - 3229.73s |  operating in an application,
3229.73s - 3232.57s |  yeah, that should be fair game for him to go seek it out.
3233.65s - 3235.75s |  Because the configuration of that particular product
3235.75s - 3238.49s |  might be different than the product itself.
3238.49s - 3239.57s |  Again, it just comes down to intent
3239.57s - 3240.45s |  and good faith, researcher.
3240.45s - 3241.61s |  State your case.
3241.61s - 3243.89s |  You know you're doing something bad if you're doing it.
3243.89s - 3245.25s |  And the people on the receiving end
3245.25s - 3248.37s |  will become wise to it eventually.
3248.37s - 3249.93s |  That is the reality of it.
3249.93s - 3251.05s |  I'm gonna differentiate.
3251.05s - 3251.89s |  I know we gotta wrap up,
3251.89s - 3253.53s |  but I'm just gonna say real quick,
3253.53s - 3255.09s |  hate the game, not the player.
3255.09s - 3260.09s |  I run a bug bounty program at a company.
3260.71s - 3262.17s |  We all talk to each other.
3262.17s - 3264.25s |  There's a whole big community of bug bounty managers.
3264.25s - 3266.09s |  We have honest conversations.
3266.09s - 3267.71s |  All of us are part of it.
3268.67s - 3272.23s |  But if you find it, submit it,
3273.37s - 3274.97s |  if you get paid out twice, you get paid out twice.
3274.97s - 3276.45s |  You get paid out 10 times, you get paid out 10 times.
3276.45s - 3277.89s |  I'm not gonna hate somebody
3277.89s - 3279.57s |  because they submitted it to me
3280.21s - 3281.05s |  and then they submitted it to a competitor
3281.05s - 3281.97s |  and they submitted it to somebody else.
3281.97s - 3285.29s |  Like, okay, I'm gonna stick in my lane.
3285.29s - 3288.53s |  I'm gonna pay the stuff that I agreed to have paid to.
3288.53s - 3290.49s |  So hate the game, don't hate the player.
3290.49s - 3293.01s |  But at the same time, if the company says,
3293.01s - 3294.53s |  sorry, this isn't my product
3294.53s - 3297.45s |  because this is actually this parent company's product,
3297.45s - 3298.45s |  don't fight that.
3298.45s - 3302.53s |  Just let it go because it's not gonna be worth
3302.53s - 3303.37s |  anybody's time fighting it
3303.37s - 3305.97s |  and you're just gonna lose any good will you had.
3305.97s - 3307.85s |  I do also think that if that happens,
3307.85s - 3309.13s |  in the interest of trying to create
3309.13s - 3310.33s |  a strong community around this
3310.33s - 3312.61s |  and bringing legitimacy to it,
3312.61s - 3314.17s |  that company probably has stepped
3314.17s - 3315.69s |  into some era of responsibility
3315.69s - 3318.05s |  for walking that up the chain,
3318.05s - 3319.09s |  seeing if it will be valid
3319.09s - 3320.73s |  for that other particular program.
3320.73s - 3322.69s |  And bug bounties are not taboo anymore.
3322.69s - 3324.25s |  We're 10 years into this maturing
3324.25s - 3326.81s |  as its own particular vertical of security.
3326.81s - 3328.53s |  Even to such to the point where if you notice
3328.53s - 3329.41s |  that a company doesn't have
3329.41s - 3330.65s |  a responsible disclosure program,
3330.65s - 3332.73s |  I'm pretty sure they're considered less than.
3332.73s - 3333.89s |  Now, there are very tactful ways
3333.89s - 3334.97s |  for us to have that conversation
3334.97s - 3337.01s |  as part of a maturity effort
3337.01s - 3339.85s |  and growing what you're trying
3339.85s - 3340.73s |  to protect your customers
3340.73s - 3342.69s |  from becoming exploited towards.
3342.69s - 3344.65s |  But I do think that whichever company
3344.65s - 3346.21s |  gets the thing that says,
3346.21s - 3347.33s |  hey, this isn't my problem,
3347.33s - 3348.73s |  it's someone else's,
3348.73s - 3349.69s |  would probably be behooved
3349.69s - 3350.57s |  to walk that up the chain
3350.57s - 3353.13s |  and see if they can redirect that researcher
3353.13s - 3354.61s |  to a good program.
3354.61s - 3356.17s |  The same way that we ask for researchers
3356.17s - 3357.13s |  to be good faith researchers,
3357.13s - 3358.97s |  I think that we should be good faith program managers.
3358.97s - 3359.97s |  Yeah, don't just close the report
3359.97s - 3361.65s |  and be like, not my problem.
3362.85s - 3364.09s |  Close the report and tell the researcher,
3364.09s - 3366.13s |  hey, not my problem, I can't fix this.
3366.21s - 3368.25s |  But you should go talk to this person
3368.25s - 3369.33s |  at this company because they have
3369.33s - 3370.25s |  a bug bounty program
3370.25s - 3371.97s |  and your report is valid for them.
3372.89s - 3374.93s |  It takes just a little bit more time to do that
3374.93s - 3377.05s |  and it's gonna probably save
3377.05s - 3378.61s |  the relationship between the researcher
3378.61s - 3380.65s |  and the company by doing that.
3381.77s - 3383.33s |  All right, and that is perfect
3383.33s - 3385.53s |  because we're gonna end right on time.
3385.53s - 3386.77s |  Obviously, we don't have time for Q&A.
3386.77s - 3388.21s |  If you do wanna chat with any of us,
3388.21s - 3390.01s |  find us out in the hall right afterwards.
3390.01s - 3390.85s |  Thank you and here's how
3390.85s - 3392.05s |  you can get in touch with everybody.
3392.05s - 3392.89s |  Thank you.
