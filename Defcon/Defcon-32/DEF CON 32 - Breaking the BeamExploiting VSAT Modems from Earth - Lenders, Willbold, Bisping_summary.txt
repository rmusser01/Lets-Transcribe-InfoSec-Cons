**VSAT Satellite Communication Systems**
- **Definition**: VSAT stands for **Very Small Aperture Terminal**, used for two-way data and voice communications in remote areas.
- **Components**: Consists of a central hub, geostationary satellite, and VSAT endpoint (dish with modem).
- **Communication**: Bidirectional with a forward channel from the hub to the endpoint and a return channel back to the hub.

**Security Threats and Models**
- **Threat Models**:
  - **Internet-Based Attacks**: Attacking through the central hub.
  - **Satellite Attacks**: Direct attacks on the satellite.
  - **Endpoint Attacks**: Direct attacks on the VSAT endpoint, bypassing the hub and satellite.
- **Historical Attack**: The ViaSat hack in 2022 disrupted thousands of VSAT endpoints during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

**Research Contributions**
- **Reverse Engineering**: Analyzed the Newtec MDM2200 modem's software and network stack.
- **Vulnerabilities Found**: Several vulnerabilities in the modem's software and communication stack.
- **Wireless Attacks**: Developed attacks using software-defined radios to:
  - Reset the modem remotely.
  - Inject malicious firmware.
  - Gain remote admin shell access.

**Technical Analysis**
- **VSAT System Components**:
  - **Indoor and Outdoor Units**: Modem acts as the indoor unit, connected to the antenna (outdoor unit).
- **Network Interfaces**: Includes ETH0, VPN devices, and a unique 'modem' interface.
- **Kernel Objects**: Revealed no encryption in the modem's network device.
- **Software Vulnerabilities**:
  - **Modem Controller**: Encryption bypass due to coding errors.
  - **SW Download Application**: Vulnerable to remote code execution due to buffer overflow.

**Attack Implementation**
- **Protocol Analysis**: Identified DVB RCS protocol for return channel over satellite.
- **Software-Defined Radio (SDR) Setup**: Used GNU Radio and USRP SDR for attack implementation.
- **Attacks**:
  - **Jamming**: Disrupts synchronization, resets the modem, and redirects it.
  - **Malicious Firmware Update**: Installs firmware without authentication or encryption.
  - **Remote Code Execution**: Exploits buffer overflow for control over the modem.

**Real-World Impact and Mitigation**
- **Impact**: Potential to target all modems using SAT 3 play protocol.
- **Cost**: Attack setup costs around $2,000.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Improve physical and data link layer security.
  - Use source authentication and updated software protocols.
  - Avoid outdated Linux kernel versions.

**Responsible Disclosure**
- **Process**: Vulnerabilities disclosed to iDirect and Swiss National Cyber Security Center.
- **Status**: Currently working on allocating CVEs for the identified vulnerabilities.
