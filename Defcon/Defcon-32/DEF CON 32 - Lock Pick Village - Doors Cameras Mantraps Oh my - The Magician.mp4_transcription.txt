0.00s - 3.52s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 So it turns out that the slides are not going to be up here,
3.52s - 6.80s |  but what I'm going to do is record my talk later
6.80s - 9.04s |  and put it up on YouTube and share it on Twitter.
9.04s - 12.12s |  So you all will get to see the slides.
12.12s - 13.24s |  I'll probably just share the slides.
13.24s - 14.64s |  That would be cool.
14.64s - 15.72s |  All right.
15.72s - 18.84s |  So my name is The Magician.
18.84s - 21.04s |  This talk is Doors, Cameras, and Mantraps.
21.04s - 23.20s |  Oh my, it is not a lock picking talk
23.20s - 24.64s |  if that's what you're here for.
24.64s - 28.20s |  This is a talk more about physical security
28.20s - 31.48s |  and the practical business aspects of security
31.48s - 34.64s |  in the PhysSec world and how to talk to clients
34.64s - 35.84s |  and how you want to get into it
35.84s - 37.84s |  if that's something you're interested in.
39.44s - 46.50s |  So hi, nice to meet you all.
46.50s - 53.32s |  I've got my notes here, even though you don't have slides.
53.32s - 55.56s |  I'm a member of the Open Organization of Lockpickers.
55.56s - 59.04s |  If you all have gone and picked locks at Lockpick Village,
59.04s - 60.48s |  then that's the tool group.
60.48s - 61.72s |  Those are my people.
61.72s - 63.32s |  Let them know The Magician sent you
63.32s - 66.84s |  and they'll set you up with some locks and some picks.
66.84s - 69.72s |  I was a physical security assessor
69.72s - 72.00s |  for Gold Sky Cybersecurity,
72.00s - 74.12s |  and they used to send me around the United States
74.12s - 75.48s |  and break into buildings,
75.48s - 76.40s |  and I would show people
76.40s - 79.24s |  how I would break into their buildings with them
79.24s - 81.32s |  so they could try it, learn it,
81.32s - 83.28s |  and the mitigation rate was much higher
83.28s - 88.20s |  because then they understood how to do the physical exploit.
90.12s - 93.16s |  Physical security still is a huge hobby for me,
94.00s - 96.64s |  even though I'm not doing it professionally anymore.
96.64s - 98.72s |  What I did was super straightforward.
98.72s - 100.52s |  I would bring people around the building
100.52s - 102.08s |  that they worked in,
102.08s - 105.36s |  and I would teach them how to break into their own facility.
105.36s - 107.04s |  Bringing the client with me
107.04s - 110.56s |  gave them the option to try it themselves,
110.56s - 113.08s |  and often the mitigation rate was much higher.
115.92s - 119.64s |  Show and tell is basically what it came down to.
119.64s - 123.08s |  I would show people what their vulnerabilities were
124.00s - 126.60s |  and explain to them how to run the exploit
126.60s - 128.40s |  so they could try it themselves,
128.40s - 131.44s |  and then I would tell the people that had hired me
131.44s - 133.08s |  what the problems were,
133.08s - 134.36s |  what I showed their team,
134.36s - 138.93s |  and how to get those things fixed.
138.93s - 142.69s |  What this talk will cover is physical security controls,
142.69s - 145.61s |  key questions that I used to ask clients,
145.61s - 147.17s |  how to educate your clients
147.17s - 149.61s |  without fear, uncertainty, and doubt,
149.61s - 152.25s |  and how you can learn physical security
152.25s - 163.26s |  if you want to get into it as a career field.
163.86s - 165.66s |  Controls are the first topic of conversation,
165.66s - 167.74s |  and I'd like to start with doors.
167.74s - 168.82s |  More often than not,
168.82s - 171.06s |  that's the first thing you're going to test.
174.50s - 177.58s |  There are a lot of mechanical components to doors,
177.58s - 179.54s |  but here's the short list.
179.54s - 181.58s |  Do perimeter doors have hinges
181.58s - 183.66s |  that are exposed to the outside?
183.66s - 185.86s |  Those hinges can be exploited.
185.86s - 189.26s |  Can I slide something between the latch and the strike plate
189.26s - 191.06s |  to pull the door open
191.06s - 193.14s |  without a key or combination?
194.02s - 196.14s |  Can I get tools over or under the door
196.14s - 198.98s |  to manipulate the door handles from the outside?
198.98s - 201.62s |  If I can run across double doors,
201.62s - 203.22s |  can I manipulate crash bars,
203.22s - 206.74s |  which are the bars that you shove open in server rooms?
206.74s - 214.70s |  These are all resolvable exploits.
214.70s - 217.06s |  Windows are the next physical security control
217.06s - 217.90s |  I used to look at,
217.90s - 219.34s |  and they're often overlooked.
220.46s - 221.82s |  Insecure windows
222.82s - 227.14s |  can be opened or manipulated in similar ways to doors.
227.14s - 229.26s |  They offer different challenges.
229.26s - 230.86s |  In a lot of office spaces,
230.86s - 235.22s |  some clients don't have policies about shoulder surfing
235.22s - 237.66s |  or looking over the shoulder of a user
237.66s - 239.34s |  to obtain information.
240.42s - 245.42s |  This is a low-complexity physical security risk,
245.66s - 248.46s |  and if someone is trying to establish
248.46s - 250.62s |  operating hours of a business,
250.62s - 252.86s |  PC operating systems used,
252.86s - 254.86s |  or even information like browser type,
254.86s - 256.06s |  looking through a window
256.06s - 261.32s |  is extremely low effort and high yield.
261.32s - 264.40s |  Fencing seems obvious at first.
264.40s - 267.76s |  Maybe folks have them in their homes or at office sites.
267.76s - 270.72s |  Fencing establishes a clear perimeter
270.72s - 273.88s |  and clearly sets an expectation of limited access.
274.72s - 276.52s |  It would take a heck of an improviser
276.52s - 278.20s |  to explain to a guard
278.20s - 281.24s |  why you were walking around a parking lot or building
281.24s - 283.60s |  at a locked and closed site.
283.60s - 286.12s |  It's also near impossible to scale a fence
286.12s - 288.12s |  in most environments during the day
288.12s - 289.80s |  without attracting attention.
290.72s - 293.56s |  Fencing is a passive security means,
293.56s - 303.67s |  meaning it doesn't require any labor.
303.67s - 306.23s |  Bollards are a great security control.
307.47s - 309.43s |  You've all seen bollards before.
309.43s - 310.99s |  They're reinforced obstacles
310.99s - 313.91s |  that prevent the use of a vehicle as a battering ram
313.91s - 315.35s |  to create a point of entry
315.39s - 318.11s |  in an otherwise defended structure.
319.03s - 325.10s |  It's another passive security risk mitigation.
325.10s - 328.74s |  Mantraps, I think, are completely underutilized.
328.74s - 332.14s |  You likely have seen these secure facilities
332.14s - 335.10s |  where a room has two separate doors
335.10s - 338.34s |  and typically two separate security access controls.
339.22s - 342.06s |  For instance, one door has an RFID badge
342.06s - 344.62s |  and a separate security door on the opposite side
344.62s - 347.94s |  of the room has a biometric security control,
348.74s - 350.74s |  like a fingerprint reader.
350.74s - 352.14s |  These require some setup
352.14s - 354.10s |  and require adherence to procedure.
355.02s - 356.54s |  Additionally, it can be a challenge
356.54s - 359.50s |  to get a flow of people through mantraps,
359.50s - 361.74s |  but they are an awesome control
361.74s - 366.09s |  and typically you'll see them at banks.
366.09s - 371.09s |  Cameras are in most businesses and some homes now.
373.09s - 375.57s |  If you have the funding at a job site,
375.57s - 378.09s |  you can even have your camera actively monitored
378.09s - 379.69s |  in a security operating center.
380.29s - 384.77s |  Lots of small to mid-sized businesses just record video
384.77s - 386.97s |  and reference it in incident response
386.97s - 390.21s |  if something goes wrong or for forensic purposes.
391.65s - 393.81s |  There are many technologies in the world of cameras,
393.81s - 396.29s |  but I firmly believe that Wi-Fi cameras
396.29s - 399.81s |  are a poor choice in many environments.
399.81s - 401.57s |  Please reach out to me
401.57s - 403.41s |  if you wanna hear that soapbox rant.
405.09s - 407.17s |  Electronic access is a really cool area
407.17s - 408.89s |  for security controls,
408.89s - 412.01s |  especially in the world where now everyone has a Flipper Zero.
413.69s - 416.13s |  Most of you have some form of token
416.13s - 418.81s |  that your office has given you to get into your building,
418.81s - 422.33s |  an RFID badge, you wave in front of a reader
422.33s - 424.21s |  that opens the door maybe.
424.21s - 429.21s |  RFID and NFC are great and they're getting better,
431.61s - 433.69s |  but the availability of the Flipper Zero
433.69s - 435.85s |  makes these not necessarily the best way
435.85s - 439.41s |  to get into a building as an only means of access.
439.41s - 441.49s |  A PIN code might be functional,
441.49s - 443.41s |  but if somebody can obtain that
443.41s - 445.93s |  by observing you entering the PIN code,
445.93s - 448.69s |  that isn't necessarily a great means of access either.
449.53s - 452.01s |  I'm one of the many cyborgs in the hacker community
452.01s - 454.73s |  and I got an implant from Dangerous Things,
454.73s - 458.25s |  so my left hand is RFID and NFC compatible,
458.25s - 465.12s |  so I don't need a right to a badge, I can write to my hand.
465.12s - 466.24s |  What matters though?
467.08s - 470.48s |  Knowing what matters to a particular entity
470.48s - 472.40s |  is of extreme importance.
472.40s - 475.24s |  I've done four minute break-ins
475.24s - 477.52s |  from parking lot to server room
477.52s - 479.40s |  and had clients tell me that
479.40s - 482.04s |  actually all of their information is in the cloud,
482.04s - 483.96s |  those servers are just dev environments
483.96s - 487.24s |  and the hard drives are encrypted, so they don't care.
487.24s - 489.56s |  So knowing what is important to your clients
489.56s - 494.10s |  is of critical importance.
494.10s - 495.74s |  Access from the perimeter is something
495.74s - 497.98s |  you actually want to talk to your client about,
498.02s - 500.38s |  not just exploring it yourself.
500.38s - 502.34s |  You want to make sure that you're getting access
502.34s - 505.42s |  to all the doors that they want you to have access to.
505.42s - 507.26s |  There isn't any shame in saying,
507.26s - 510.50s |  can you please show me your physical infrastructure
510.50s - 514.34s |  and where all the doors are that are of a concern to you?
514.34s - 516.38s |  Then you can be sure that you're tackling
516.38s - 517.98s |  all that client's concerns.
518.86s - 520.90s |  Conversely, there might be doors
520.90s - 522.62s |  that they don't think are a concern
522.62s - 527.30s |  that you probably should bring to their attention.
527.30s - 529.58s |  Because you are truly treated as a guest
530.22s - 532.62s |  in the scenario of a security risk assessor,
532.62s - 536.06s |  you can test guest badge policies firsthand.
536.06s - 539.10s |  In some cases, if it's in scope,
539.10s - 542.02s |  you can try enticing the client
542.02s - 543.58s |  to give you a guest badge
543.58s - 548.14s |  and asking them if it's okay for you to go to the restroom.
548.14s - 549.78s |  Many times you can find yourself
549.78s - 552.62s |  in the office of a CEO or CFO
552.62s - 554.66s |  without any kind of supervision,
554.66s - 557.06s |  sometimes hours after you were let in,
557.06s - 561.09s |  without anyone hassling you.
561.73s - 565.53s |  As a social engineering enthusiast, this is a huge topic.
566.85s - 569.05s |  Entire companies are dedicated
569.05s - 571.97s |  to just educating and empowering employees
571.97s - 575.85s |  to ask as part of the security team for a company.
575.85s - 577.33s |  There are quick points,
577.33s - 579.61s |  here are some quick points to the matter.
579.61s - 582.05s |  Gamify your security training.
582.05s - 585.33s |  A traveling trophy can go to the desk of a person
585.33s - 588.49s |  with the least clicks in an email phish,
588.49s - 591.01s |  or maybe to someone who always locks their computer
591.83s - 592.73s |  when they get up to go to the break room.
592.73s - 594.93s |  Be creative and let employees know
594.93s - 596.41s |  that they are an integral part
596.41s - 598.61s |  to your security at the company,
598.61s - 601.01s |  and that they can be a huge line of defense.
601.01s - 605.40s |  Every employee is part of the security team.
605.40s - 608.00s |  Constructive criticism is always better
608.00s - 609.56s |  than belittling somebody
609.56s - 611.88s |  for their lack of security knowledge.
611.88s - 613.80s |  How can you talk to a client?
613.80s - 615.60s |  How you talk to a client will determine
615.60s - 617.88s |  how they mitigate your findings.
617.88s - 620.24s |  While there have been tons of technical talks
620.24s - 623.56s |  about how to exploit mechanical components
623.56s - 625.12s |  of physical security,
625.12s - 626.20s |  there have been just a few
626.20s - 629.16s |  that cover the specifics of educating clients
629.16s - 631.40s |  on how to go about resolving their exploits.
633.20s - 635.00s |  Saying things like this is really bad,
635.00s - 636.64s |  need to be replaced with,
636.64s - 638.68s |  we have some really good opportunities here
638.68s - 640.20s |  for positive change.
640.20s - 642.76s |  Simple phrasing can mean a world of difference
642.76s - 647.76s |  and can lead to a very different side of client morale,
648.04s - 650.48s |  and also can determine whether or not
650.48s - 655.64s |  they're going to hire you next year.
656.72s - 658.76s |  The show and tell was always my favorite part,
658.76s - 661.48s |  the demonstrations and solutions.
661.48s - 664.32s |  Showing the defenders vulnerabilities on site
664.32s - 665.76s |  is immensely fun
665.76s - 668.00s |  and can have an extremely positive impact.
668.96s - 673.96s |  Talking somebody through how you can bypass a door
675.48s - 677.88s |  versus showing them how to do it
677.88s - 680.32s |  have huge differences in the likelihood
680.36s - 684.76s |  that an issue will be mitigated or a solution implemented.
684.76s - 688.84s |  These steps in the process
688.84s - 691.48s |  also get the most heads popping into the room.
692.44s - 693.68s |  People get really excited
693.68s - 696.48s |  when you show them how to do an under door slip
696.48s - 701.48s |  or use an under door tool or a latch slit.
705.00s - 707.08s |  Avoid fear, uncertainty and doubt.
707.08s - 711.24s |  This one's probably the most critical in my opinion.
711.24s - 714.64s |  You wanna avoid letting people know that things are bad.
714.64s - 718.12s |  You wanna make sure that even if something is really bad,
718.12s - 721.92s |  good news, I'm here, I found this thing,
721.92s - 723.60s |  now we can tackle it together
723.60s - 725.32s |  and it won't be a problem anymore.
728.41s - 729.65s |  How to educate clients
729.65s - 732.53s |  and provide a means for clients to contact you.
732.53s - 735.13s |  You wanna make sure that after you've done your test
735.13s - 737.17s |  and you've written your report,
737.17s - 738.85s |  you wanna provide contacts
739.61s - 743.33s |  that are officially your work contacts
743.33s - 745.05s |  for people to reach out to you
745.05s - 746.81s |  and ask you follow up questions.
746.81s - 749.61s |  They're going to happen, nobody knows everything
749.61s - 751.45s |  and even professionals might forget
751.45s - 753.37s |  to provide some key information.
753.37s - 757.33s |  Giving them a company email or a company phone number
757.33s - 758.81s |  and requesting that they reach out to you
758.81s - 761.69s |  during company time is really important
761.69s - 763.01s |  because then they can reach out
763.01s - 766.21s |  if they have some sort of immediate concern
766.25s - 770.13s |  or just if they want you to return later.
770.13s - 772.25s |  That point of contact is pretty critical.
773.93s - 776.61s |  Now, this is something that might be important
776.61s - 780.17s |  to all of you, how can you get into physical security?
780.17s - 782.85s |  I'm gonna talk about some podcasts, YouTube channels
782.85s - 785.33s |  and Udemy access options
785.33s - 787.25s |  for you to get into physical security.
788.25s - 791.21s |  And I'm old, so I'm gonna hold this very close to my face.
792.89s - 795.37s |  I feel education is the most important aspect
795.41s - 796.89s |  in hacking and security.
796.89s - 798.53s |  That's not to say that a four-year degree
798.53s - 801.05s |  or anything like that is necessary.
801.05s - 803.57s |  The different approaches to learning are varied
803.57s - 805.57s |  and there are a few podcasts,
805.57s - 809.37s |  YouTube and Udemy were big wins for me personally.
809.37s - 811.21s |  If you want to get into lockpicking
811.21s - 814.69s |  or just see some jaw-dropping feats of lock exploits,
814.69s - 817.21s |  then look no further than Lockpicking Lawyer.
817.21s - 820.57s |  The content of his channel is consistently enjoyable
820.57s - 822.49s |  and never stale or boring.
822.49s - 826.17s |  If you are an auditory learner, then podcasts are fantastic.
826.17s - 828.09s |  Darknet Diaries is amazing
828.09s - 830.61s |  with great storytelling and incredible guests
830.61s - 832.37s |  and lessons learned are valuable
832.37s - 835.13s |  and always come in an entertaining package.
835.13s - 838.19s |  If you want direct attention towards certification,
838.19s - 840.69s |  I think Mike Myers does a great job on Udemy
840.69s - 844.13s |  and anything and everything by the Exam Cram Book Company
844.13s - 848.17s |  I think is fantastic.
848.17s - 851.45s |  Simply learning how to do physical security from books
851.45s - 854.25s |  isn't necessarily for everybody, but it worked for me
854.25s - 857.93s |  because I could revisit individual concepts very quickly.
857.93s - 859.61s |  Dale Carnegie has a book called
859.61s - 862.17s |  How to Win Friends and Influence People
862.17s - 864.97s |  if you want to do physical on-site pen testing
864.97s - 867.81s |  where you're not going to be announcing your presence.
867.81s - 870.37s |  Practical Lockpicking by Deviant Olaf
870.37s - 872.45s |  is a fantastic technical read
872.45s - 874.85s |  on physical security and lockpicking.
874.85s - 877.41s |  The Art of Deception by Kevin Mitnick,
877.41s - 881.13s |  it's a little flourishy, but the content is really good.
881.93s - 884.73s |  What Everybody is Saying by Joe Navarro
884.73s - 886.77s |  will help you with body language.
886.77s - 889.21s |  And again, I just want to call out Exam Cram,
889.21s - 892.85s |  they're really good and they give you extra tasks
892.85s - 900.32s |  and they give you flashcards.
900.32s - 901.72s |  You got the slides?
901.72s - 903.00s |  Just in time, Ian.
904.36s - 907.04s |  So these are three people who helped me a lot
907.04s - 908.80s |  as I was getting started.
908.80s - 911.52s |  If you find somebody on YouTube or at a con
911.52s - 913.72s |  that speaks to you personally,
913.72s - 915.76s |  the language they're using sounds good,
915.76s - 918.40s |  the ethos sound good, you just vibe with it,
918.40s - 920.52s |  reach out to them, send them an email,
920.52s - 922.72s |  throw them some information on Twitter.
922.72s - 925.20s |  I brought cards, if what I'm saying sounds interesting,
925.20s - 927.50s |  please walk up to me and I will give you some.
928.68s - 931.76s |  Deviant, Ian, and Jason helped me a ton.
931.76s - 933.96s |  He's right here, wave at him, embarrass him.
935.96s - 938.28s |  Definitely reach out to the people
938.28s - 939.76s |  that you find interesting.
939.76s - 942.96s |  We as hackers enjoy telling stories.
942.96s - 946.40s |  So we're not going to be annoyed by you, I promise.
949.81s - 951.77s |  Take guided courses.
951.77s - 954.77s |  Taking guided courses are expensive,
954.77s - 956.65s |  but being able to raise your hand and say,
956.65s - 958.77s |  I don't understand the thing
958.77s - 961.37s |  is a really, really, really big deal.
961.37s - 964.17s |  And being right in front of the person
964.17s - 966.25s |  or on the other end of a video call
966.25s - 971.32s |  makes that exchange very quick and very efficient.
971.32s - 973.18s |  Attend local meetings.
973.18s - 975.86s |  If you've got a DEF CON group meet up near you,
975.86s - 977.96s |  please go, please meet people.
977.96s - 979.42s |  It might be the opportunity
979.42s - 981.56s |  that you need to get the job that you want,
981.56s - 983.86s |  or just give you the person that you need to talk to
983.86s - 986.46s |  to learn how to do the thing that you're trying to do.
990.68s - 991.52s |  Oh, no laptop.
992.48s - 995.86s |  Okay, how to learn physical security.
995.86s - 998.80s |  Other than just taking courses, reading books,
998.80s - 1000.44s |  go to a local tool meetup
1000.44s - 1004.16s |  or go to LPV right here at DEF CON.
1004.16s - 1006.24s |  Try to pick locks, have fun.
1006.24s - 1008.68s |  No one's going to judge you if you don't know how to.
1008.68s - 1010.60s |  Those are the best people.
1010.60s - 1012.56s |  And we'll be able to give you
1012.56s - 1014.80s |  the proper techniques off the bat.
1014.80s - 1017.40s |  So you don't have to worry about spending hours
1017.40s - 1019.14s |  or days doing it the wrong way.
1020.60s - 1022.22s |  I just want to say a special thanks
1022.22s - 1023.96s |  to my friends and family,
1023.96s - 1026.34s |  all the Orlando hackers that have helped me out.
1026.34s - 1027.18s |  Hi.
1028.60s - 1029.60s |  Thank you all.
1029.60s - 1030.64s |  Hack all the things.
1030.64s - 1033.56s |  If you have any questions, please talk to me.
1033.56s - 1035.06s |  Here's me.
1035.06s - 1039.54s |  There's my email address, my Twitter and my LinkedIn.
1039.54s - 1040.60s |  Take a picture.
1040.60s - 1041.76s |  I don't mind pictures.
1041.76s - 1043.72s |  I can't see all of you because of the lights,
1043.72s - 1045.10s |  but hi everybody.
1045.10s - 1045.94s |  Hi.
1047.42s - 1049.04s |  Please reach out to me if you have questions
1049.04s - 1051.22s |  about physical security or breaking into buildings
1051.22s - 1053.10s |  or you just want some stories.
1053.10s - 1054.14s |  I'm the magician.
1054.14s - 1057.60s |  I hope you have a fun time at DEF CON.
