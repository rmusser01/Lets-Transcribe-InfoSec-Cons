**Introduction to Fly Catcher and ADS-B Security**

- **Fly Catcher**: A low-cost device developed for **ADS-B monitoring** and detecting aircraft **spoofing**.
- Created using **Raspberry Pi** and compatible with multiple **software-defined radios**.
- Utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network** to detect spoofed aircraft signals.

**Background and Motivation**

- Author's interest in the intersection of **aviation** and **security**.
- Experience as a **pilot** and a **cybersecurity researcher**.
- Focus on **Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B)** technology.

**ADS-B Overview**

- **Automatic**: No manual input required from the pilot.
- **Dependent**: Requires **GPS signals** for transmitting aircraft information.
- **Surveillance**: Provides comprehensive data like **airspeed**, **positioning**, and **altitude**.
- Vulnerabilities: **Unauthenticated** and **unencrypted**, making it susceptible to attacks.

**Security Vulnerabilities in ADS-B**

- **Jamming**: Flooding the frequency with data.
- **Spoofing**: Creating ghost planes by fabricating data packets.
- **Replay Attacks**: Capturing and retransmitting earlier packets.
- **Message Injection**: Altering telemetry data like **altitude** and **speed**.

**Project Focus on Spoofing**

- Chose spoofing due to its customizable nature.
- Utilized **artificial intelligence** to detect spoofed airplanes.

**Device Development Process**

- Set up an **ADS-B reception ground station**.
- Constructed a portable device to collect data during flights.
- Trained a **deep neural network** for detecting aircraft spoofing.

**Training and Testing the Neural Network**

- Used historical **ADS-B records** from sources like **ADS-B Exchange** and **FlightAware**.
- Collected data from personal **ground station** and flights.
- **Training Data**: A mix of valid and manually generated spoofed signals.

**Device Testing and Data Collection**

- Tested by flying over various locations in **South Bay Los Angeles**.
- Collected **ADS-B signals** to train the machine learning model.

**Future Improvements**

- Implement **RSSI fingerprinting** for signal strength analysis.
- Explore additional **deep learning models** and **refined algorithms**.
- Improve **training data** through **data augmentation** techniques.

**Conclusion**

- The project demonstrated potential in detecting **ADS-B spoofing** but requires further refinement and data collection for increased accuracy.
