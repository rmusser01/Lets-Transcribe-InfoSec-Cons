**Introduction**
- Efficient bug bounty automation techniques talk by **Gunnar Andrews**
- **AppSec engineer** by day, **bug bounty hunter** by night
- Focus on **bug bounty hunting, recon, tool development**

**Talk Goals**
- **Resources versus findings**: Maximizing results with minimal cost
- **Automating collection**: Efficient data collection methods
- **Data engineering**: Shift from flat text files to advanced data handling

**Bug Bounty Automation**
- Avoid brute forcing initially; use other techniques first
- Monitor **millions of domains and endpoints** without brute forcing
- Importance of **Apex domains** in bug bounty programs

**Apex Domains**
- Warning: Automating Apex domains can lead to scope errors
- Sources for finding Apex domains include **reverse whizzing** and **ASN checking**

**Hardware and Tools**
- Easy access to hardware for scanning **IPv4 IP address space**
- Tools like **Caduceus** for TLS handshake and certificate analysis

**Subdomain Discovery**
- Use **passive DNS sources** for subdomain discovery
- Tools like **cert.sh** and **CT logs** for certificate transparency

**DNS Resolution**
- Importance of resolving domains multiple times to avoid missing assets
- Use **PowerDNS** and **custom DNS resolution clusters** for efficiency

**Port Scanning**
- **SMAP**: Passive port scanning using Shodan
- Follow up with active tools like **mass scan** for verification

**Web Fingerprinting**
- Perform on resolved domains only
- Use proxies and **AWS Lambda** for distributed scanning

**Data Engineering**
- Track both **subdomains and IPs** for comprehensive data analysis
- Use modern data systems over flat files for efficiency

**Conclusion**
- More data leads to more bugs if used correctly
- Engage with the community, share knowledge, and collaborate
