 Good morning, everybody.
2.00s - 5.36s |  I'd like to welcome Dr. Morris for Student Engagement
5.36s - 14.14s |  Doesn't Have to Suck with XR Village.
14.14s - 15.62s |  What's going on?
15.62s - 17.30s |  Y'all better wake up.
17.30s - 18.82s |  I'm that professor.
18.82s - 23.38s |  Hi, I'm Dr. Messina Morris, Molder of Minds.
23.38s - 26.02s |  My students at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia
26.02s - 27.98s |  call me Dr. Mom.
27.98s - 29.06s |  They won't let it go.
29.06s - 31.30s |  So I told them it had to stand for something.
31.30s - 34.14s |  And so I am the Molder of Minds.
34.14s - 37.26s |  And I am here to talk to you all about how student engagement
37.26s - 39.02s |  doesn't have to suck.
39.02s - 39.86s |  Why?
39.86s - 40.78s |  I know it.
40.78s - 44.30s |  I was a biomolecular chemistry PhD student
44.30s - 48.66s |  who had teachers that talked to me like this.
48.66s - 54.46s |  Today, we're going to be.
54.46s - 56.22s |  Did y'all just learn some chemistry?
56.22s - 56.94s |  Oh, you didn't.
56.94s - 59.02s |  OK, so I had to go teach myself.
59.02s - 62.58s |  And so I became a professor to make chemistry
62.58s - 66.22s |  more accessible for more people, because we need more people
66.22s - 69.14s |  to see molecules like me, right?
69.14s - 72.54s |  OK, so student engagement doesn't have to suck.
72.54s - 74.14s |  I'm Dr. Messina Morris.
74.14s - 75.86s |  You can find me at Unite the Metaverse.
75.86s - 77.26s |  And I have an assignment for you.
77.26s - 78.82s |  And I know some of you all want to do it.
78.82s - 79.90s |  And some of you all don't.
79.90s - 83.10s |  So I have two different options.
83.10s - 85.30s |  Here's a QR code, OK?
85.30s - 86.86s |  If you want to stay linked in with me,
86.86s - 88.98s |  because sometimes after a talk goes,
88.98s - 90.26s |  you want to talk to the people.
90.26s - 92.86s |  But you can't, because they're flying off to another event.
92.86s - 94.02s |  So go ahead and get this.
94.02s - 95.94s |  And I can stay in contact with you.
95.94s - 97.50s |  This is the QR code.
97.50s - 100.78s |  And then I'll give you.
100.78s - 102.78s |  And then if you want to just follow me,
102.78s - 104.94s |  you go to my website and then put
104.94s - 109.46s |  that I met you at DEFCON at UniteTheMetaverse.com
109.46s - 111.98s |  in the contact submission, however you want to do it.
111.98s - 113.38s |  Those are your two options.
113.38s - 115.58s |  Go to my website or get this QR code
115.58s - 116.82s |  and put your information in.
116.82s - 118.28s |  I'll put you on my server, because I
118.28s - 121.10s |  am training 1,000 educators and 1,000 student creators
121.10s - 123.86s |  to do what I do, OK?
123.86s - 125.50s |  I think all of my students are ready.
125.50s - 127.86s |  So let's go.
127.86s - 129.22s |  All right.
129.22s - 131.98s |  So why AITAs?
131.98s - 137.90s |  So people might say, why would you put AI teaching assistants
137.90s - 138.98s |  in schools?
138.98s - 141.86s |  Because they're going to get rid of teachers.
141.86s - 143.90s |  Well, let me just help you understand
143.90s - 146.14s |  as an educator the capacity.
146.14s - 149.50s |  It's not even as many students as I typically
149.50s - 153.38s |  have in one period in this particular classroom.
153.38s - 155.14s |  In a lecture hall, there's usually hundreds
155.14s - 157.22s |  of students in chemistry.
157.22s - 160.26s |  And so when there are hundreds of students
160.26s - 161.82s |  and you have no teaching assistant,
161.82s - 163.58s |  or you might have one or maybe two
163.58s - 165.34s |  that are also graduate students that
165.34s - 168.10s |  are matriculating through their graduate experience,
168.10s - 171.38s |  they don't have time to get to all of the student questions.
171.38s - 173.46s |  And you just don't have enough time in the day.
173.46s - 177.06s |  So I have given my cell phone number out since 2009
177.06s - 180.32s |  to students saying, please just contact me
180.32s - 183.22s |  if you need anything, creating accessibility.
183.22s - 185.98s |  Well, historically, when they used AI-powered teaching
185.98s - 188.10s |  assistants, they were just chatbots.
188.10s - 192.22s |  And so why are we using this now?
192.22s - 194.42s |  They're 3D, they're spatial, and they're
194.42s - 196.82s |  in unique environments.
196.82s - 199.70s |  But it's going to help us enhance efficiency and reduce
199.70s - 201.34s |  administrative burden.
201.34s - 203.18s |  It's going to help us personalize learning
203.18s - 206.46s |  and student support, and then improve access to information,
206.46s - 208.34s |  because I'm a chemist that wants to do that,
208.34s - 211.54s |  and then enhance classroom interaction.
211.54s - 214.54s |  So when you think about the future of what classrooms are,
214.54s - 217.30s |  you might think that the classrooms actually
217.30s - 218.96s |  look like what you're seeing on day one.
218.96s - 220.54s |  They still look like whatever it looked
220.54s - 222.86s |  like when you were in school.
222.86s - 224.06s |  It has not evolved.
224.06s - 226.06s |  Education has not evolved.
226.06s - 229.90s |  But even still in the world, we are
229.90s - 232.30s |  in the age of the intelligent classroom
232.30s - 235.18s |  where we should, where AI technology
235.18s - 238.34s |  and educational pedagogy are going to intersect.
238.38s - 241.06s |  And so I coined the term metaversive teaching
241.06s - 243.58s |  and learning when I created the Metaversity at Morehouse
243.58s - 246.98s |  College, so that people could understand
246.98s - 249.38s |  that there's a pedagogical approach to making
249.38s - 252.34s |  virtual reality of the classroom and doing it effectively,
252.34s - 255.58s |  as well as using AI-powered teaching assistants.
255.58s - 257.86s |  All of the technologies that undergird
257.86s - 259.86s |  what is going to be the metaverse,
259.86s - 262.62s |  or what will be the next iteration of the web
262.62s - 264.86s |  as we go into this fourth industrial revolution,
264.86s - 268.42s |  it's really important that our students are understanding
268.42s - 273.86s |  at the college level what the new future of work looks like.
273.86s - 276.38s |  There is a disconnect.
276.38s - 279.66s |  So a lot of the issues that I have,
279.66s - 288.84s |  or a lot of my professors have with me even doing this is,
288.84s - 289.84s |  what do y'all think?
289.84s - 291.08s |  Let me hear from the audience.
291.08s - 293.88s |  What do you think the teachers are saying about this?
293.88s - 296.52s |  What are educators saying about AI-powered teaching
296.52s - 298.48s |  assistants?
298.48s - 300.12s |  Go.
300.12s - 304.37s |  We're not ready for that.
304.37s - 306.01s |  Crazy is never going to work.
306.01s - 308.33s |  What else?
308.33s - 310.13s |  It's not personal enough.
310.13s - 311.25s |  That's the one.
311.25s - 313.13s |  Anybody else?
313.13s - 316.65s |  We're going to replace human beings, right?
316.65s - 318.53s |  Yes.
318.53s - 319.93s |  Say it again?
319.93s - 321.25s |  Cheating.
321.25s - 321.89s |  Cheating.
321.89s - 322.41s |  Well, guess what?
322.41s - 323.89s |  They're going to do it anyway.
323.89s - 325.69s |  What else?
325.69s - 328.61s |  If you're going to cheat life, you're going to do it anyway.
329.41s - 332.49s |  So the biggest thing is, we are trying
332.49s - 335.89s |  to engage students to learn and comb through information.
335.89s - 339.53s |  And we are in the age of what I call the connected student.
339.53s - 343.01s |  Students who literally have been scrolling,
343.01s - 347.09s |  were born into this technology, don't know quite how to use it,
347.09s - 349.17s |  don't ethically know how to use it,
349.17s - 352.21s |  didn't see the evolution of it, but it's here.
352.21s - 355.29s |  And so they use it however they feel like it.
355.29s - 359.01s |  And since there is really no safe guardrails on it,
359.01s - 362.01s |  teachers are afraid of what could be.
362.01s - 366.17s |  So I created this platform along with my educational partners,
366.17s - 371.45s |  Victory XR, to make sure that we had a tool that teachers could
371.45s - 374.53s |  use so that they wouldn't say, oh, we're
374.53s - 377.49s |  going to erase human beings out of the classroom.
377.49s - 380.25s |  Because literally, human intelligence
380.25s - 382.29s |  created artificial intelligence.
382.29s - 385.01s |  And I know all of you all in the room know this.
385.01s - 390.51s |  But for some reason, it didn't trickle down to education.
390.51s - 394.87s |  So we are building an emotionally intelligent
394.87s - 397.95s |  conversational AITA model.
397.95s - 400.11s |  And I'm going to show you what that looks like.
400.11s - 401.63s |  I'm going to do a demo of it.
401.63s - 405.63s |  But let me get through just the meat of this conversation.
405.63s - 410.35s |  Because I want you to see it in order to understand it.
410.35s - 414.91s |  But who remembers Homework Helpline as just me?
414.91s - 417.11s |  Homework Hotline, call.
417.11s - 418.51s |  OK, for help, just me.
418.51s - 421.55s |  OK, we failed y'all, the rest of y'all in here.
421.55s - 423.47s |  We should have had Homework Helpline for you.
423.47s - 426.27s |  But anyway, you used to be able to pick up your phone
426.27s - 428.59s |  and call for help.
428.59s - 429.87s |  Uh-oh.
429.87s - 432.27s |  See, it's not going to act right.
432.27s - 433.11s |  Come on, Canva.
433.11s - 435.99s |  Don't act wrong.
435.99s - 439.45s |  OK, don't worry about it.
439.45s - 440.77s |  It's not going to, my thing.
440.77s - 444.29s |  OK, so AI is a new TA.
444.29s - 446.21s |  And if you remember Homework Helpline,
446.21s - 450.61s |  then you remember that it was access to information 24-7.
450.61s - 452.49s |  If your students came home from school,
452.49s - 455.17s |  they could call up somebody and get help.
455.17s - 457.01s |  Now, the thing about Homework Helpline
457.01s - 459.21s |  is there used to be a teacher on the other line.
459.21s - 461.01s |  And there used to be a teacher sitting there
461.01s - 462.69s |  with all their books behind them,
462.69s - 465.53s |  trying to figure out what the heck your homework talking
465.53s - 467.57s |  about, which is also hard.
467.57s - 469.89s |  And that's the problem with tutoring in general,
469.89s - 471.61s |  is that you don't know where the learning
471.61s - 472.73s |  losses are for students.
472.73s - 475.25s |  You don't know where the gaps in understanding are.
475.25s - 479.65s |  But in the back end of our interface of this AI teaching
479.65s - 482.09s |  assistant, this kind of like Homework Helpline,
482.09s - 484.01s |  we actually do have formative assessment.
484.01s - 485.53s |  So I can track and see.
485.53s - 488.97s |  And I can see the transcript of all my students on the back end.
488.97s - 493.21s |  And it's closed off to go into my lessons first and all
493.21s - 495.01s |  of the resources that I put up there,
495.01s - 497.65s |  open educational resources that I have put together
497.65s - 501.25s |  and cultivated over years of my craft.
501.25s - 504.37s |  And it's going to go there and lead them and guide them
504.37s - 507.17s |  through scripted lessons that I've created.
507.17s - 512.21s |  So now, it's going to force them to go through the resources
512.21s - 516.29s |  that I've created first and then go back.
516.29s - 518.65s |  And it also then detracts them.
518.65s - 522.29s |  So if they get off the topic and just say, hey,
522.29s - 524.77s |  well, I want to know, how do you make blue earrings?
524.77s - 525.93s |  And it's a chemistry class.
525.93s - 528.21s |  It's going to say, hmm, the color blue
528.21s - 529.49s |  is going to think for a while.
529.49s - 531.85s |  And it'll probably come back with something like, well,
531.85s - 535.93s |  the color blue is a reflection of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
535.93s - 537.69s |  But we're talking about chemistry.
537.69s - 540.53s |  And the lesson is about atomic number.
540.53s - 542.17s |  So let's shift back.
542.17s - 544.17s |  And it's going to do that for students, which
544.17s - 546.33s |  is a great way to redirect them.
546.33s - 549.05s |  Students can also interrupt and answer questions
549.05s - 551.49s |  and ask questions in the middle.
551.49s - 557.17s |  And it recognizes different dialects as well as languages.
557.17s - 559.41s |  So how do I think I can do this?
559.41s - 562.09s |  So somebody said, we're not ready for it.
562.09s - 564.01s |  Somebody said, we can't do it.
564.01s - 564.97s |  It's going to fail.
564.97s - 568.45s |  But I have already proved a model will work in the hardest
568.45s - 569.49s |  time possible.
569.49s - 571.65s |  During a pandemic in the spring of 2021,
571.65s - 573.29s |  I launched Morehouse in the metaverse
573.29s - 575.69s |  along with three other professors of mine
575.69s - 577.73s |  in English, history, and biology.
577.73s - 579.01s |  And I'm the only chemist.
579.01s - 582.89s |  And I'm launching in advanced inorganic chemistry.
582.89s - 586.17s |  There was no chemistry content at all,
586.17s - 589.53s |  no 3D spatial assets, hardly anything.
589.53s - 593.17s |  So all of what I was creating was created along
593.17s - 595.53s |  with software developers, along with everybody.
595.53s - 600.17s |  And I had to learn how to use my techies across
600.17s - 602.53s |  to be more interdisciplinary than I've ever been,
602.53s - 604.57s |  to be more cross-disciplinary than ever.
604.57s - 609.33s |  So I can proudly tell you all that since spring of 2021,
609.33s - 613.81s |  we have taught 44 courses fully in virtual reality.
613.81s - 616.89s |  We have over 550 headsets at Morehouse College
616.89s - 618.25s |  in Atlanta, Georgia.
618.25s - 620.29s |  It's a historically Black college and university
620.29s - 622.73s |  that educates young Black men to be
622.73s - 626.01s |  leaders in their community.
626.01s - 628.33s |  So I am so excited.
628.33s - 633.01s |  We have seen outcomes of up to 11.9% increase
633.01s - 634.53s |  in student achievement.
634.53s - 637.61s |  We also saw that our students came to class more.
637.61s - 642.01s |  And we increased attendance rates by 10 percentage points.
642.01s - 644.17s |  Students come to class more when
644.17s - 649.65s |  they have access to technology that engages them.
649.65s - 652.41s |  So we saw this.
652.41s - 655.97s |  We've published it in peer-reviewed journals.
655.97s - 659.89s |  And this is the next best step.
659.89s - 663.49s |  The next step is to increase the number of student interactions
663.49s - 665.73s |  and engagement, the length of their interactions.
665.73s - 670.13s |  And this is available on the Chrome browser, the AITTAs.
670.13s - 671.53s |  They don't have to have a headset.
671.53s - 673.97s |  We have 2,200 Morehouse students.
673.97s - 676.61s |  And not everybody has a headset.
676.61s - 679.17s |  Well, I'm doing my best to fundraise to get us headsets.
679.17s - 681.85s |  But in the meanwhile, educational institutions
681.85s - 684.65s |  have a friction point when it comes to the technology.
684.65s - 687.69s |  And so putting it on a Chrome browser for interaction
687.69s - 691.37s |  and to help allows teachers to, one, be able to create easily
691.37s - 696.17s |  and also students to be able to access content easily too.
696.17s - 698.77s |  But what we're looking for is, are we
698.77s - 701.53s |  increasing the number of engagements or interactions
701.53s - 702.89s |  that students are having?
702.89s - 705.81s |  Are they maintaining these interactions?
705.81s - 709.01s |  And then, are their grades actually increasing?
709.01s - 713.13s |  And do they see a future in their careers
713.13s - 715.25s |  that can be pegged out using this technology?
715.25s - 717.25s |  Because all career pathways now are
717.25s - 719.13s |  going to have to be tech-adjacent,
719.13s - 720.45s |  every single one of them.
720.45s - 723.57s |  There is no such thing as an English professor that
723.57s - 725.37s |  does not use technology.
725.37s - 731.13s |  There is no such thing now as a journalist or a humanities
731.13s - 734.89s |  professor or anybody in any other field
734.89s - 735.93s |  that doesn't use tech.
735.93s - 737.65s |  That ship has sailed.
737.65s - 740.01s |  But I think everyone in this room knows that.
740.01s - 743.73s |  So I'm going to bust some myths real quick about AI and AITA.
743.73s - 746.21s |  So some of the things that you all said,
746.21s - 748.13s |  AI will replace teachers.
748.13s - 750.25s |  No, it will augment the classroom
750.25s - 752.13s |  because we don't really have capacity.
752.13s - 756.69s |  And imagine having to serve even all of you all in this room
756.69s - 759.45s |  and all of the questions that you all may have had
759.45s - 762.13s |  individually and give you all a personalized experience.
762.13s - 764.65s |  And I have to do that in 50 minutes.
764.65s - 766.81s |  And I have to teach you complex information.
766.81s - 771.21s |  And I only get to see you two to three times a week.
771.21s - 774.85s |  That's a huge responsibility and task to put on just the teacher.
774.85s - 777.57s |  And while I know that I am gifted,
777.57s - 780.69s |  if I could put it in their heads, I would do it.
780.69s - 785.45s |  But I need something for students to be able to access
785.45s - 788.53s |  when it's 3 a.m. and they're studying,
788.53s - 792.21s |  Dr. Morris' cell phone is on silent,
792.21s - 795.57s |  I'm getting ready so I can serve them in the morning.
795.57s - 797.81s |  But you know how it is in college.
797.81s - 801.25s |  They went out before they studied and they got a test in the morning.
801.25s - 803.29s |  So it's 3 a.m.
803.29s - 806.41s |  And the question is,
806.41s - 808.97s |  I don't know how to find math number,
808.97s - 812.45s |  but Dr. Morris has a lesson on math number
812.45s - 817.93s |  straight from the content directly to the key standards that we want to hit.
817.93s - 821.49s |  I'm going to go run that playback and then I'm going to ask it the question.
821.49s - 824.25s |  And now I ain't got to go filter through Google.
824.25s - 826.05s |  I ain't got to go filtering through.
826.05s - 828.73s |  I ain't got to go figuring out, oh, Lord, like what?
828.73s - 832.41s |  I can go directly to a resource and use it.
832.41s - 836.69s |  And I didn't have to log into 3460 interfaces to get there.
837.45s - 840.45s |  So we're not replacing teachers,
840.45s - 843.45s |  we're increasing the capacity of teachers for
843.45s - 846.33s |  students who need more personalized instruction.
846.33s - 849.33s |  We're also implementing AI because,
849.33s - 855.77s |  oh, it says implementing AI requires extensive technical expertise.
855.97s - 858.57s |  Not so much.
858.57s - 861.81s |  What it does require is grit.
861.81s - 867.33s |  So the teacher dashboard is as user-friendly as any social media platform.
867.49s - 872.61s |  But people still think teachers have to code.
872.61s - 874.85s |  I'm not asking you to take on another task.
874.85s - 876.53s |  I'm not asking you to pick up another craft.
876.53s - 881.81s |  I'm asking you to just know how to help students.
881.81s - 885.81s |  So AI is detrimental to students' learning and encourages cheating.
885.81s - 887.97s |  Somebody over here said that, right?
887.97s - 891.09s |  Well, you teach students how to use it appropriately.
891.09s - 894.49s |  You teach them how to use AI appropriately by introducing
894.53s - 898.65s |  it to them and showing them the right workflow.
898.65s - 901.69s |  So that is how you do it.
901.69s - 904.01s |  AI-driven education is for older students.
904.01s - 907.13s |  Lifelong learning is very necessary.
907.13s - 911.25s |  But what we really need to do is integrate this education at the smallest,
911.25s - 914.25s |  at the youngest levels, with Generation Alpha, right?
914.25s - 917.69s |  We need these young babies to really understand the evolution
917.69s - 919.81s |  and take part in the creation.
919.81s - 922.41s |  They have wonderful, amazing ideas.
922.45s - 928.09s |  We participated in XPRIZE Connect over this past spring with my college students,
928.09s - 930.25s |  but it's usually for our high school students.
930.25s - 934.37s |  And these students are just fabulous at coming up and constructing ideas.
934.37s - 938.93s |  So when you integrate it early, you can demystify the technology.
938.93s - 941.57s |  AI in schools compromises privacy and security.
941.57s - 944.13s |  And I know that is a huge thing for people.
944.13s - 950.09s |  But the platform that we use, even though it does access AI,
950.09s - 953.85s |  open AI, we have it carted off and their parameters set
953.85s - 956.81s |  so that our information does not flow back to them.
956.81s - 959.29s |  So you all understand that.
959.29s - 961.73s |  But in this digital age, we have taken all precautions
961.73s - 963.89s |  to make sure that privacy and security are paramount.
963.89s - 968.49s |  We have the same platform as any learning management system would.
968.49s - 970.69s |  So students have used these learning management systems,
970.69s - 975.65s |  and they follow FERPA laws, federal laws, to protect students' privacy and security.
975.65s - 977.41s |  And we've done it with our metaversity.
977.41s - 983.85s |  So I'm pretty confident that we can do it and do our best job first in this pilot this fall.
983.85s - 986.57s |  And so these are the hypothesized outcomes.
986.57s - 991.17s |  We hope to improve academic performance, obviously, to engage students more
991.17s - 994.81s |  and to create higher levels of motivation for them.
994.81s - 996.13s |  Better retention rates.
996.13s - 1000.73s |  So we have a huge problem with stopouts in terms of education.
1000.73s - 1003.41s |  For young black males, they run out of money, they run out of funding,
1003.41s - 1005.09s |  they run out of time, whatever.
1005.09s - 1008.09s |  They have other pressing issues that happen in their lives.
1008.09s - 1009.57s |  And life happens to all of us, right?
1009.57s - 1012.05s |  So that's what's happening.
1012.05s - 1013.33s |  And so students stop out.
1013.33s - 1017.13s |  And so we want to make sure that we are giving them continuous support
1017.13s - 1020.33s |  and personalized learning experience that can be accessed anywhere.
1020.33s - 1024.53s |  And then enhance their skill development because they need these four Cs.
1024.53s - 1029.05s |  They need collaboration, creativity, critical thinking skills, and communication.
1029.05s - 1032.81s |  They need these interactions, and they need them with AI tools.
1032.85s - 1038.21s |  So the Department of Education will be using them to train pre-service teachers
1038.21s - 1043.61s |  at Morehouse, the History Department, Sociology, our Student Success Center in areas
1043.61s - 1045.93s |  of math, physics, and foreign language.
1045.93s - 1050.01s |  And we will be doing peer-to-peer tutoring support and study group support as well.
1050.01s - 1054.97s |  I'm also training 1,000 educators and 1,000 student creators to use our tool
1054.97s - 1056.41s |  and create their own lessons.
1056.41s - 1058.41s |  And it doesn't matter what it's about.
1058.41s - 1060.85s |  And it's going to be like a teachers pay teachers model for them.
1060.85s - 1065.13s |  So they'll be incentivized to create in this space.
1065.13s - 1069.05s |  But what we really want to know is, will students ask more questions?
1069.05s - 1074.57s |  You know, there's a student that sits in the classroom for an entire year.
1074.57s - 1076.69s |  And they'll never ask a question.
1076.69s - 1080.73s |  And they'll never ask a question because they feel like their question doesn't matter.
1080.73s - 1084.41s |  That the person right next to them isn't thinking the exact same thing
1084.41s - 1085.65s |  that they are thinking.
1085.65s - 1087.01s |  And that's not true.
1087.01s - 1091.01s |  But they will ask it to these AITAs because they can ask it anything.
1091.01s - 1095.21s |  And it gives them that privacy, safety, and security to ask those questions
1095.21s - 1100.93s |  that will then get them back to the answer that they need and close those learning gaps.
1100.93s - 1106.69s |  So my predicted effect is that student engagement will definitely increase.
1106.69s - 1110.81s |  And students don't have to come to the professor to be retaught a lesson
1110.81s - 1114.01s |  if they miss for whatever reason.
1114.41s - 1116.49s |  I have a whole lot of peer-reviewed journals.
1116.49s - 1119.53s |  And this is for the people that just really want peer-reviewed journals.
1119.53s - 1122.05s |  Find me and I'll send it to you.
1122.05s - 1123.29s |  But I thank you.
1123.29s - 1124.57s |  My image won't pop up.
1124.57s - 1125.73s |  I don't know why.
1125.73s - 1128.93s |  Oh, the girl with the connection left.
1128.93s - 1132.37s |  I was connected to somebody's Wi-Fi and they walked out.
1132.37s - 1134.01s |  That's hilarious.
1134.01s - 1137.57s |  So you can stay connected with me, Dr. Morris.
1137.57s - 1140.53s |  I guess my QR code will not show up there.
1140.53s - 1142.49s |  But that's fine.
1142.49s - 1145.41s |  What I want to show you, though, let me see if I can.
1145.41s - 1147.45s |  I don't have a Wi-Fi connection.
1147.45s - 1148.93s |  That is hilarious.
1148.93s - 1150.01s |  I just realized that.
1150.01s - 1152.73s |  At least I got to the end of my talk.
1152.73s - 1156.01s |  So you can stay connected with me at UniteTheMetaverse.com.
1156.01s - 1158.97s |  I had a real cute picture to show y'all to say thank you.
1158.97s - 1161.73s |  I was standing like a superhero.
1161.73s - 1167.77s |  So anyway, I really wish that you all could see the demo.
1167.77s - 1171.85s |  But for whatever reason, I don't have Wi-Fi connection
1171.85s - 1175.09s |  now in the middle of the talk.
1175.09s - 1178.53s |  So thank you so much for your attentiveness.
1178.53s - 1181.13s |  And I will leave more room for questions
1181.13s - 1183.49s |  if anybody wants to ask me any questions.
1183.49s - 1186.73s |  But you can find me at UniteTheMetaverse.com.
1186.73s - 1189.97s |  And I am Dr. Messina Morris or Dr. Ma,
1189.97s - 1192.33s |  motor of minds, first metaversity director
1192.33s - 1196.57s |  in the world, first to introduce these type of spatial 3D AI
1196.57s - 1199.97s |  customizable TAs, happy to do it,
1199.97s - 1204.01s |  working in conjunction with multiple partners in tech
1204.01s - 1206.57s |  and EdTech partners, Victory XR to do it,
1206.57s - 1207.73s |  and Morehouse College.
1207.73s - 1213.27s |  So thank you.
1213.27s - 1214.03s |  Any questions?
1214.03s - 1215.19s |  Everybody raise your hand.
1215.19s - 1218.43s |  There's no dumb questions here.
1218.43s - 1228.15s |  Yes.
1228.15s - 1235.25s |  Yes.
1235.25s - 1240.17s |  OK, so network, ability to handle it on the network,
1240.17s - 1243.58s |  is that what you asked me?
1243.58s - 1245.90s |  Oh, IT support, just IT support.
1245.98s - 1248.50s |  OK, so I'm my IT support.
1248.50s - 1249.90s |  It is challenging.
1249.90s - 1253.10s |  The blessing in this is that I'm married to a network design
1253.10s - 1255.10s |  engineer.
1255.10s - 1258.86s |  So I kind of had a cheat code with me.
1258.86s - 1263.82s |  He's my husband, and I would be like, what do we do?
1263.82s - 1270.54s |  But I do say this, you always have an ally in a space.
1270.54s - 1272.66s |  I always walk over to IT because I
1272.66s - 1275.06s |  did get one person to really help me and help me figure out
1275.10s - 1277.10s |  the network and help me figure out the firewalls
1277.10s - 1278.58s |  and help me figure out everything.
1278.58s - 1281.22s |  And some institutions like medical schools,
1281.22s - 1283.98s |  graduate schools that have information
1283.98s - 1286.90s |  that they keep in databases definitely
1286.90s - 1290.38s |  have to have a separate network for connecting for this.
1290.38s - 1292.94s |  So we got another separate connection
1292.94s - 1297.26s |  for network devices just so that students can get on devices.
1297.26s - 1298.86s |  I also have a partnership with T-Mobile.
1298.86s - 1300.74s |  So I got a lot of hot spots, and I
1300.74s - 1303.06s |  won their unconventional innovation of the year award.
1303.06s - 1308.82s |  So that too, allies.
1308.82s - 1311.02s |  You're welcome.
1311.02s - 1312.02s |  Anybody else?
1312.02s - 1317.67s |  There's no dumb question here.
1317.67s - 1318.51s |  Yes.
1318.51s - 1361.52s |  All right, so his question is, when should you ask AI for?
1361.52s - 1364.08s |  When should you ask AI a question,
1364.08s - 1366.84s |  or when should you ask a teacher the question?
1366.84s - 1371.80s |  I think that you should always, always ask your instructor.
1371.80s - 1373.60s |  But let me tell you something, human beings
1373.60s - 1375.08s |  don't know everything.
1375.08s - 1377.84s |  And what we're going to do is go do the same thing
1377.84s - 1381.48s |  that you're going to do, but with more trained expert eyes.
1381.48s - 1383.80s |  I'm going to go comb through all of the resources
1383.80s - 1385.60s |  that I know to comb through, and I'm
1385.60s - 1387.28s |  going to go reteach myself things
1387.28s - 1388.96s |  that I forgot long ago.
1388.96s - 1392.12s |  And then I'm going to come back, and I'm going to teach you.
1392.12s - 1393.56s |  That's how it goes.
1393.56s - 1395.84s |  So when do you ask your teacher a question?
1395.84s - 1398.64s |  I think that you should always go to your instructor first.
1398.64s - 1402.36s |  But if you're in a bind, and you don't have the answers,
1402.40s - 1406.36s |  and you need to access information, use your resources.
1406.36s - 1407.60s |  This is a resource.
1407.60s - 1409.16s |  So ask it any question.
1409.16s - 1410.68s |  Ask it what to wear for class.
1410.68s - 1413.24s |  I don't care what you ask it, but ask it questions
1413.24s - 1415.84s |  because that's what it's there for.
1415.84s - 1419.88s |  And you will learn how to close your own learning gaps
1419.88s - 1423.28s |  and ask relevant questions to get you to what answer
1423.28s - 1424.92s |  you need to understand.
1424.92s - 1427.08s |  And that's what we're trying to measure,
1427.08s - 1432.24s |  is do students begin to ask questions also more effectively?
1432.24s - 1435.16s |  Because they're asking more questions.
1435.16s - 1436.56s |  They're not just asking.
1436.56s - 1438.24s |  There's a difference between a question
1438.24s - 1440.72s |  that gets you the answer that you're looking for
1440.72s - 1442.36s |  and a question that doesn't.
1442.36s - 1444.48s |  So thank you so much.
1444.48s - 1446.52s |  I appreciate that.
1446.52s - 1449.64s |  Thank you for your time and for listening so attentively.
1449.64s - 1450.88s |  All of y'all get a gold star.
1450.88s - 1452.68s |  I'm going to come back to you in the back
1452.68s - 1455.08s |  because they've given me the red flag.
1455.08s - 1456.44s |  All right, take care.
1456.44s - 1459.48s |  Find me at UniteTheMurderVerse.com.
