  "description": "Some diagnostic services in UDSonCAN that could affect driving should be disabled while driving and protected by authentication mechanisms such as SecurityAccess. However, without these security measures, attackers can cause a serious safety risk to the driver using only diagnostic messages. In this talk, we introduce UDSonCAN attacks discovered through fuzzing and describe their countermeasures. These attacks can cause a moving car to suddenly stop or a stationary car to suddenly acceleration with just simple diagnostic messages. We discovered these vulnerabilities in the latest electric vehicle model and have prepared a demo.",

0.00s - 9.68s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Hello, my name is Seunghee Han. I'm a small girl from Korea and the first author of this talk.
9.68s - 18.48s |  It's my first time at DEF CON so I'm very nervous and so excited. Anyway, the title of this talk
18.48s - 28.48s |  is UDS on CAN attacks, discovering safety critical risk by fuzzing. In this presentation, I will
28.48s - 34.88s |  talk about the weak points that I found in the latest EV models by fuzzing test.
38.74s - 46.02s |  Before the presentation, let me introduce ourselves. We are all security researchers
46.02s - 54.82s |  at Autocrypt. Autocrypt is a mobility security company. Nowadays, we are focusing on vehicle
54.82s - 68.50s |  security. With the 2020 WP.29, it's a car cyber security rules. All car makers must get CSMS
68.50s - 76.42s |  certification. So we have been doing fuzzing tests with many OEMs and tier suppliers.
76.42s - 85.22s |  During the fuzzing test, I found some strange behavior in the car. The moving car was stopped
85.78s - 95.30s |  or it didn't move. This video is showing the weak point that I found in the latest EV model.
95.86s - 119.39s |  Let's take a look. Can we play a sound? Okay, let's see one more. The moving car was stopped.
119.95s - 128.11s |  Are you interested? Now, I will explain why this happened. So please pay attention.
130.11s - 139.95s |  Contents are as follows. First, I will explain UDS and fuzzing. Then I will explain what the
139.95s - 146.59s |  type of attacks that I did and explain how to prevent this weak point.
148.51s - 155.07s |  I told you, I found a weakness during the fuzzing test. The moving car was stopped
156.03s - 164.67s |  or didn't move at all. I will explain how these problems are connected to UDS and what caused
164.67s - 174.99s |  them. First, UDS is a protocol used for communication with vehicles. It is defined in
174.99s - 183.39s |  ISO 14229. I don't have a car, but if you have one, you probably go to a repair shop
184.19s - 192.75s |  when something goes wrong with your car, right? The tool used to find out what's wrong is UDS.
193.71s - 201.15s |  During this process, the diagnostic tool and the car communicate using UDS to determine the
201.15s - 213.71s |  problem. As I mentioned, UDS services perform important functions, so not everyone can use
213.71s - 221.31s |  these services freely. You can see some of the security measures on this slide. I will give you
221.95s - 233.60s |  more details later. To ensure that UDS is well-protected, many car companies do fuzzing
233.60s - 242.24s |  tests. Fuzzing is a testing method where random or unusual data is fed into a system to find
242.24s - 250.64s |  problems. The goal of this test is to see how the system behaves under stress and to find
251.20s - 260.32s |  security issues. In the vehicle industry, we commonly do black box fuzzing using commercial
260.32s - 269.60s |  fuzzers. There are many talks about CAN, UDS, and UDS fuzzing in CHP. Check out those talks
270.48s - 281.89s |  for more details. During the UDS fuzzing test, we discovered something is wrong. The vehicle
282.21s - 291.01s |  functions with two services. The first is ECU reset, and the second is communication control.
292.21s - 300.21s |  Based on these findings, we made real-world attack scenarios. The first scenario is
300.21s - 312.03s |  sudden stop, and the second is disabling of vehicle usage. Before explaining the attacks,
312.03s - 322.19s |  you need to understand the two services. The first service is ECU reset. It is used to reset
322.19s - 339.36s |  the ECU. It is often used for troubleshooting or testing purposes. This is the actual method
339.92s - 353.28s |  that I did. You can perform hard reset with the first sub-function. This is the hard reset method.
354.72s - 364.70s |  And you can perform soft reset with the third sub-function. It's the soft reset method.
372.72s - 382.96s |  With the ECU reset method, you can stop the vehicle's engine. There are two scenarios
382.96s - 390.88s |  that I did. The first is sending an ECU reset message to a moving vehicle to make it stop
390.88s - 401.65s |  suddenly. And the second scenario is vehicle disabling. Continuously sending ECU reset messages
401.65s - 410.77s |  to disable the vehicle's functions. The root cause of these issues is that ECU reset is not
410.77s - 419.97s |  disabled in drive mode. Normally, this service is restricted during driving because it can be
419.97s - 432.93s |  dangerous. And ISO 14229 says that the condition of server is ignition is on and system not be in
432.93s - 446.51s |  an operational mode. I tested this on a new Lattice EV SUV model. And the target ECU is the
446.51s - 459.30s |  gateway control unit. I conducted the test while the vehicle was driving. Here are the attack steps.
460.10s - 468.26s |  Connect the laptop to the vehicle's OBD port using a CAN interface and just start the engine.
469.46s - 480.54s |  Then we send a message and observe the vehicle. It's that simple. This photo shows the hardware
480.54s - 489.26s |  setup. The OBD cable is connected to the OBD port and the laptop is connected via the CAN interface.
490.14s - 500.62s |  The CAN bus parameters are set to standard values. The first scenario is sudden stop scenario.
503.28s - 512.64s |  Set up the hardware setting and just we send the ECU reset message to moving vehicle.
514.40s - 523.66s |  Then the moving vehicle comes to a sudden stop. Let's check it out through the video.
524.78s - 551.10s |  The video is very short, so watch it carefully. Um, no sounds. Okay, let's see one more. We sent a message
552.14s - 561.82s |  then the moving car was stopped. I'm gonna play one more. This time, please look at the cluster.
567.95s - 575.23s |  After the message, the cluster was turned off. It was rebooted, but the car shut down.
576.91s - 591.97s |  The video on the left shows the exterior. You can see the car
591.97s - 599.17s |  moving back and forth and back and forth, which shows that the brake pedal was not pressed.
601.74s - 610.86s |  This attack can cause mechanical failure or damage. At high speeds, this could lead to serious
610.86s - 622.54s |  accidents. The second scenario is vehicle disabling. It's similar to the first scenario,
622.54s - 631.82s |  but in this case, the ECU reset message is sent continuously. The vehicle cannot be controlled
631.82s - 649.97s |  until the attack stops. The vehicle starts and the message is sent continuously. The vehicle
649.97s - 659.01s |  will not start and the gear shifting is disabled. The vehicle is completely uncontrollable.
668.21s - 681.01s |  Let's watch it one more time. Again, the cluster. Please look at the cluster. The cluster screen
681.01s - 694.10s |  turns off and multiple warnings appear. Due to the continuous attack, the cluster shuts down
694.10s - 710.02s |  and the vehicle becomes uncontrollable. The driver appears to be very confused. Here are the logs of
710.02s - 718.98s |  the ECU reset attacks. Some parts are blurred for security reasons. You can see the logs of both
718.98s - 730.64s |  hard reset and soft reset. To summarize the ECU reset attack, in drive mode, you can stop
730.64s - 739.84s |  the engine by using ECU reset message. Continuous attacks can prevent the driver
739.84s - 748.32s |  from controlling the vehicle. Also, the cluster will reboot and appear multiple warnings.
748.96s - 758.24s |  These attacks can be very dangerous on the road. Therefore, this service must be operated
758.24s - 768.37s |  only in not ready state. Here is the first service description. How is it? It's good?
769.09s - 780.72s |  Okay, now I will explain the second service. The second service is communication control.
781.60s - 789.68s |  This service is, it is used to control the communication functions of the ECU. This is
789.68s - 801.22s |  the actual message that I did. And also, you can set the control type using the sub functions.
803.14s - 818.32s |  The strange behavior appears with sub function one and three. Use sub function one to enable
819.20s - 828.72s |  Rx and disable Tx of the ECU. This is the message for sub function one.
830.24s - 841.44s |  And you also use sub function three to disable Rx and Tx. This is the message for sub function
841.44s - 855.31s |  three. You can control the ECU's communication type using this method. An attacker can disable
855.31s - 867.47s |  Tx and Rx of the ECU by transmitting communication control message. I performed two scenarios.
867.47s - 876.35s |  The first is brief pause and sudden movement. And second scenario is vehicle disabling.
877.15s - 884.59s |  The root cause of this strange behavior is that communication control is not disabled in drive
884.59s - 898.11s |  mode. And also, this service does not require security authentication. The first scenario
898.11s - 907.63s |  is brief pause and sudden movement. Set the hardware setting and set the gear to drive.
908.51s - 919.47s |  Then just resend the message. The driver will release the brake pedal to move forward.
920.67s - 928.11s |  But the vehicle does not move for a few seconds even when the foot is taken off the brake pedal
928.11s - 939.81s |  in drive mode. After a few seconds, the vehicle suddenly moves. Okay, let's check it out through
939.81s - 971.68s |  the video. I'm sorry to the sound is not playing. I'm gonna play one more. Please check the cluster.
975.63s - 983.47s |  The gear is set to drive. Then we send a message. The vehicle doesn't move even when the brake
983.47s - 992.27s |  pedal is released. Then after a few seconds, it suddenly moves. It's an interesting symptom.
996.61s - 1003.17s |  I'll explain the second scenario. The second scenario is vehicle disabling attack.
1004.85s - 1009.73s |  It's similar to the first, but this time we send message continuously.
1010.61s - 1018.37s |  When attack messages are sent in subsection, the driver loses complete control over the vehicle.
1019.25s - 1062.10s |  Let's take a look. We sent message continuously. Yeah, the driver sets the gear to drive.
1062.90s - 1076.93s |  Then we sent a message. We sent message continuously. The scariest part is that we don't
1077.81s - 1091.09s |  know when the attacker will stop. When we stop the attack, the vehicle suddenly starts moving.
1093.52s - 1103.31s |  If the driver is pressing the gas, it's very, very dangerous. Okay, let me summarize the communication
1103.31s - 1111.31s |  control attack. This type of attack can disable the transmission and reception of the ECU.
1112.27s - 1120.35s |  As shown in the previous video, it can control the vehicle either briefly or continuously.
1122.19s - 1130.91s |  Unlike on previous attack ECU reset, this attack doesn't turn off ECU.
1132.35s - 1143.54s |  So when the attack stops, the vehicle could suddenly move. Therefore, this service should
1143.86s - 1155.20s |  be operated only in not ready. Here are the logs of communication attacks. Some parts are blurred
1155.20s - 1167.49s |  for security reasons too. So how could these attacks happen in real life? You might wonder.
1168.45s - 1178.85s |  Here are some examples. First, an attacker secretly enter the vehicle and connect the
1179.89s - 1190.59s |  wireless OBD device. Some OEMs use wireless diagnostic tools. Since drivers usually don't
1190.91s - 1200.27s |  check the OBD port, the vehicle could be unprotected. And second, attacks can happen
1200.27s - 1206.51s |  from a short distance using wireless communication like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
1208.03s - 1217.63s |  Some OEMs use Wi-Fi to connect diagnostic tools. Vehicle without security measures are very
1217.63s - 1224.43s |  vulnerable to these type of attacks. That's why such attacks could happen at any time.
1226.27s - 1234.83s |  So I'll suggest two countermeasures for these attacks. The first, important services like
1234.83s - 1242.27s |  ECU reset and communication control must be operated only in not ready state. It's meaning
1242.27s - 1250.75s |  when the engine is off. The second, these services should only be possible after security
1250.75s - 1257.71s |  access authorization is granted. I shortly mentioned the security access service earlier.
1261.79s - 1269.31s |  To time restrictions, I will explain just one thing about the security access authorization.
1270.11s - 1277.95s |  There is the security access service. This service uses a seed and key to provide security
1277.95s - 1287.95s |  procedure. It only unlocks security when the correct seed and the key. If authentication
1287.95s - 1299.09s |  fails, it locks the ECU for a certain time to enhance security. There is also when connecting
1299.57s - 1309.46s |  a diagnostic tool, some OEMs use security algorithms. And another measure is the gateway
1309.46s - 1318.46s |  safety function. Previously, various data could be accessed without filtering but now
1319.66s - 1325.42s |  the gateway filters the data allowing only certain information to be accessed.
1326.38s - 1336.14s |  So I discovered this weak point in April. After conducting additional tests, I reported on June
1336.14s - 1345.90s |  10th. But I was told that the vulnerability is not actionable in reality and that it works as
1346.86s - 1357.90s |  is designed. However, I still believe it is a weakness. I believe that after sharing my
1357.90s - 1369.36s |  presentation today, you will agree with me. Okay, finally, let me summarize. Some diagnostic
1369.36s - 1378.16s |  services can have a significant impact on vehicle driving. If an attacker transmits the diagnostic
1378.16s - 1387.92s |  message to driving vehicle, a serious accident may occur. So security for diagnostic services
1387.92s - 1401.02s |  is essential. That's all for my presentation. Thank you for listening. Okay, my name is Seunghee Han.
1401.02s - 1406.30s |  I'm from South Korea, not North. Thank you.
