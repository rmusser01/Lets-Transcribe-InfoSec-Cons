8.69s - 13.69s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 a device called the HoloLens, which essentially is a mixed reality computer.
13.69s - 21.69s |  So, if you are wearing the huge headset back in the day, you can interact with the people,
21.69s - 25.69s |  but also you can interact with holograms, and the holograms can interact with you.
25.69s - 32.69s |  So, one of the NASA surgeons in Houston was assisting one of the astronauts.
32.69s - 35.69s |  Her name is Samantha Cristoforetti, as you can see over there.
35.69s - 43.69s |  In her view, she could see holograms about where to make the incisions, what to measure.
43.69s - 51.69s |  She was able to see x-rays and information to help her to perform a medical procedure.
51.69s - 58.69s |  It was a huge success. We performed this procedure with no issues at all.
58.69s - 67.48s |  This mission was led by the NASA surgeon and also Air Force General Dr. George Smith.
67.48s - 72.48s |  And after that, he came to me and said, hey, Fernando, I really like this.
72.48s - 78.48s |  It was cool. What else can we do? And that's Dr. George Smith and I.
78.48s - 86.48s |  And I said, well, I heard that Microsoft is developing something called holographic teleportation.
86.48s - 88.48s |  And he told me, okay, what's holographic teleportation?
88.48s - 96.48s |  I said, okay, they have this studio. They have 109 cameras with a laser, with a LiDAR.
96.48s - 104.48s |  You come into the studio, they capture you, and a couple of weeks later, they deliver you a file, which is huge.
104.48s - 109.48s |  You put it in the HoloLens, and you can see a hologram of yourself.
109.48s - 112.48s |  It's not live, but it's a hologram of yourself.
112.48s - 121.48s |  And he told me, hey, I really like this. I want you to make this happen on a station, and I want you to make it live.
121.48s - 126.48s |  And I said, okay, we can do that. That was 2018.
126.48s - 133.48s |  And to give you an idea about what is holographic teleportation, the best analogy for me is 3D printing.
133.48s - 141.48s |  With a 3D printer, you have thousands of layers of material until you have a solid object.
141.48s - 147.48s |  With holoportation, it is the same. We call it actually volumetric video.
147.48s - 153.48s |  You have thousands of layers of video until you have a solid hologram of someone.
153.48s - 161.48s |  You can interact with a hologram. You can feel the hologram with something we call haptics, and they can see you.
161.48s - 165.48s |  Why this is better compared with FaceTime or any video conference?
165.48s - 168.48s |  Well, you have six axes of freedom.
168.48s - 180.48s |  So going back to my story, Joe told me like, okay, let's put it on a station, but we have multiple limitations.
180.48s - 186.48s |  One, here on Earth, Microsoft has a studio with 109 cameras.
186.48s - 188.48s |  On a station, we only have one.
188.48s - 196.48s |  Second, here on Earth, it was recorded and processed using very powerful gaming computers.
196.48s - 201.48s |  On a station, it needs to be live and with very old computers.
201.48s - 207.48s |  Believe it or not, on the Space Station, we have something called SSE computers, Space Station computers.
207.48s - 218.48s |  And those are very old computers because those computers don't receive big damage from radiation or atomic oxygen or conditions in space.
218.48s - 224.48s |  Then the other challenge was we don't have a constant communication.
224.48s - 228.48s |  Here on Earth, we have a satellite. We have an antenna.
228.48s - 234.48s |  We just aim to any of the satellites, and we have communication.
234.48s - 244.48s |  On a station, the station is moving so fast, every 90 minutes, it completes an orbit on Earth.
244.48s - 249.48s |  So what happened, we have an antenna that aims down instead of up.
249.48s - 260.48s |  But because the station is moving so fast, we need to adjust that antenna, like maybe every 15, every 20 minutes, and aim to another satellite.
260.48s - 263.48s |  So in those gaps, we don't have any communication.
263.48s - 265.48s |  We call it satellite handovers.
265.48s - 268.48s |  Then we have multiple firewalls.
268.48s - 271.48s |  And then the biggest limitation is bandwidth.
271.48s - 278.48s |  On a station, we have something called Skynet, which is not related with the movie.
278.48s - 282.48s |  We have something called CloudNet, which is our internet on a station.
282.48s - 285.48s |  But we have 20 megabits per second.
285.48s - 293.48s |  It's super slow, and we use 20 megabits per second for everything, to run the station, trying to dock spacecrafts and everything.
293.48s - 300.48s |  So when we came with the idea of using holoportation, they only gave us 5 megabits per second.
301.48s - 312.48s |  And to give you a better idea how a hologram looks like, that picture is one of my employees in Alabama holoporting next to me in Texas.
312.48s - 314.48s |  So really, you can see the person.
314.48s - 323.48s |  You can see if I have a camera, and I'm aiming to this auditorium, I can beam you up and make you holograms everywhere.
323.48s - 325.48s |  And I have a very cool video.
325.48s - 332.77s |  Hopefully, it will play here about telemedicine.
333.77s - 334.77s |  Yes.
334.77s - 342.18s |  Let me fast-forward.
350.18s - 355.18s |  Though neither Nathan nor I have any medical experience or expertise,
355.18s - 363.18s |  we'd like to show you a few steps from the stroke evaluation test, as well as a few physical therapy exercises,
363.18s - 368.18s |  to give you a sense for the power of this software, as well as some potential use cases.
368.18s - 370.18s |  So let's get started.
370.18s - 375.73s |  Nathan, thanks for joining us today.
375.73s - 379.73s |  I'd like to go through a few steps of a stroke evaluation,
379.73s - 384.73s |  and then we'll do a couple of physical therapy-type exercises,
384.73s - 389.73s |  just to give our viewers an illustration of some of the power of this.
389.73s - 392.73s |  So let's start with the stroke evaluation.
392.73s - 394.73s |  So that's a stroke evaluation.
394.73s - 396.73s |  I don't know if you can hear it clearly.
396.73s - 401.73s |  But in front of my colleague, Mark, is Nathan Rehm in Alabama.
401.73s - 404.73s |  So for Mark, Nathan is right there.
404.73s - 407.73s |  And from Nathan, Mark is right there.
407.73s - 409.73s |  We are right here, person to person.
418.73s - 421.73s |  So he's asking to raise the hands and all the procedure.
421.73s - 424.73s |  And I'm going to move forward to the next slide.
424.73s - 430.73s |  But that will give you some idea about this technology.
430.73s - 440.96s |  So going back to using this technology on a station, on the space station,
440.96s - 447.96s |  during 2019, as you know, we had COVID and we had isolation.
447.96s - 452.96s |  And NASA was very sensitive about pushing the gas for technologies
452.96s - 456.96s |  that will help us in isolation situations
456.96s - 460.96s |  and also to literally bridge medicine
460.96s - 463.96s |  and trying to bring the best physicians to the station
463.96s - 465.96s |  and perform medical evaluations.
465.96s - 467.96s |  So we did it.
467.96s - 471.96s |  Dr. George Smith was the first human holoporter to the space station.
471.96s - 473.96s |  The second one was me.
473.96s - 478.96s |  And he performed a couple of medical evaluations to some of the astronauts.
478.96s - 482.96s |  That was a one-way holoportation.
482.96s - 484.96s |  So just to give you an idea,
484.96s - 489.96s |  that's Dr. George Smith at NASA's Mission Control, Building 30,
489.96s - 491.96s |  interacting with one of the astronauts.
491.96s - 496.96s |  So for the astronaut, for the crew member, Dr. Smith was there.
496.96s - 500.96s |  But for Dr. Smith, he was looking to a computer screen.
500.96s - 505.96s |  He was watching a computer screen just to try to interact with the astronaut.
505.96s - 507.96s |  It was very successful.
507.96s - 514.96s |  NASA sent a press release, which became viral in at least 15 different languages.
514.96s - 520.96s |  And one of the reasons is Dr. Smith is a huge fan of Star Trek,
520.96s - 524.96s |  so he made Live Long and Prosper from Spock.
524.96s - 527.96s |  So let me tell you a story.
527.96s - 531.96s |  His wife is from Japan, from a very remote island in Japan.
531.96s - 535.96s |  According to Dr. Smith, they don't have any television.
535.96s - 539.96s |  They only have radio, which was cool.
539.96s - 543.96s |  And then he was on vacation in Japan.
543.96s - 545.96s |  His brother-in-law came running and said,
545.96s - 547.96s |  Hey, Joe, Joe, guess what?
547.96s - 550.96s |  NASA invented some technology called holoportation,
550.96s - 556.96s |  and they sent a NASA surgeon to the space station as a hologram, blah, blah, blah.
556.96s - 559.96s |  And Joe asked him, Hey, how do you know that?
559.96s - 561.96s |  And he said, Well, it was on the radio.
561.96s - 564.96s |  He said, On the radio here in this remote island of Japan?
564.96s - 565.96s |  And he said, Yes.
565.96s - 569.96s |  So what happened then, he called me and said, Hey, Fernando, guess what?
569.96s - 571.96s |  The news are here in Japan.
571.96s - 573.96s |  I said, No, Joe, the news are everywhere.
573.96s - 577.96s |  This was one of the most viral press releases from NASA.
577.96s - 578.96s |  So NASA got excited.
578.96s - 580.96s |  I got excited.
580.96s - 584.96s |  And then that happened in October 2019.
584.96s - 587.96s |  We continue with the holoportations.
587.96s - 594.96s |  And then December 2019, NASA called me and I was like, Okay, I'm going to receive an award.
594.96s - 595.96s |  That's pretty cool.
595.96s - 597.96s |  They're going to give me a prize.
597.96s - 602.96s |  They told me, Hey, we need to move forward and have a two-way holoportation.
602.96s - 607.96s |  So that means like the astronaut on a station will be beamed down as a hologram
607.96s - 611.96s |  while someone at mission control will be beamed up as a hologram
611.96s - 613.96s |  and they can interact with each other.
613.96s - 614.96s |  And I said, Okay, that's cool.
614.96s - 616.96s |  And I was just taking notes.
616.96s - 621.96s |  I said, Okay, it's going to be the first mission with private citizens.
621.96s - 624.96s |  The name of the company is Axiom.
624.96s - 626.96s |  It's Axiom One Mission.
626.96s - 628.96s |  It's going to be the first time that this happened.
628.96s - 629.96s |  I was just taking notes.
629.96s - 632.96s |  I said, It's going to happen in April.
632.96s - 637.96s |  And most of the projects with the government take like four to five years at least.
637.96s - 639.96s |  So I was like, That was 2019.
639.96s - 641.96s |  And I asked, Okay, that's pretty cool.
641.96s - 644.96s |  So you're talking April 2024, 2025.
644.96s - 647.96s |  And they told me, No, it's April 2020.
647.96s - 649.96s |  So you need to move forward.
649.96s - 651.96s |  You need to make this fast.
651.96s - 657.96s |  You need to send all the equipment to the station because we want this to happen.
657.96s - 664.96s |  And they said the guy managing this is a billionaire from Montreal, from Canada,
664.96s - 665.96s |  and he wants to make this happen.
665.96s - 670.96s |  And I was like, Okay, you want me to risk my reputation, my success,
670.96s - 675.96s |  trying to put something together in three months with a crew member that didn't have all the training?
675.96s - 676.96s |  And they said, Yes.
676.96s - 681.96s |  I said, Okay, just to be sure, did you say millionaire with an M or billionaire with a B?
681.96s - 682.96s |  And they said billionaire.
682.96s - 684.96s |  And I said, Okay, that changed everything.
684.96s - 686.96s |  That means like money is not an issue.
686.96s - 688.96s |  So we moved forward.
688.96s - 689.96s |  It was hard.
689.96s - 693.96s |  We tested all the equipment that we needed on the station.
693.96s - 701.96s |  It was hard during Christmas to test all the equipment for radiation or radio frequencies and everything.
701.96s - 705.96s |  And it was very hard to try to find someone willing to stay.
705.96s - 712.96s |  Like this room, this chamber is like maybe this size, but it really isolate everything.
712.96s - 713.96s |  There's no light.
713.96s - 714.96s |  There's no sound.
714.96s - 716.96s |  You can hear your heartbeat.
716.96s - 718.96s |  There is no radio frequencies.
718.96s - 726.96s |  And what they want to do is to put the equipment there and be sure that there is no light coming from the equipment, no sound, no radio frequencies.
726.96s - 731.96s |  I was like, Well, it's going to be very hard to find an idiot to be there during Christmas.
731.96s - 733.96s |  But they found that it was me.
733.96s - 737.96s |  So I tested, which was a huge success.
737.96s - 750.96s |  And then during this period, NASA is one of the most positive agencies, always taking the best solutions and showing solutions.
750.96s - 752.96s |  We tried to make this happen.
752.96s - 757.96s |  We have a facility in Houston that simulates the space station.
757.96s - 759.96s |  It didn't work.
759.96s - 761.96s |  We work a full Friday.
761.96s - 763.96s |  We have 10 NASA centers.
763.96s - 765.96s |  And someone just connected trying to throw a solution.
765.96s - 767.96s |  It didn't work.
767.96s - 769.96s |  They said, Yeah, it's not going to happen.
769.96s - 771.96s |  I told them, Hey, let me try it with my team.
771.96s - 773.96s |  Let me create my own facility.
773.96s - 775.96s |  Give me the weekend.
775.96s - 777.96s |  And we figured out a way to make that happen.
777.96s - 778.96s |  It worked.
778.96s - 781.96s |  NASA told us four times it will not be able on that timeline.
781.96s - 783.96s |  We made it happen.
783.96s - 786.96s |  And they told me like, Hey, that was a huge Hail Mary.
786.96s - 791.96s |  So by April, we made this a success.
791.96s - 796.96s |  We had the first crew of astronauts on a station, holoporting back to Earth.
796.96s - 807.96s |  So what you will see on this video that looks like Minecraft, and I will explain to you why, is Mark Patti, the first human holoported from a station to mission control.
807.96s - 812.96s |  And also on the back, you may be able to see a camera of him on a station.
812.96s - 818.96s |  And that was a medical evaluation from one of the NASA surgeons holoported to a station.
818.96s - 826.94s |  Meanwhile, he was holoported down to Earth.
826.94s - 840.05s |  Can you point with your other hand to where that pain is?
840.05s - 844.05s |  And then we have other two astronauts that want to join to the party.
844.05s - 862.13s |  So this video was taken from a station, from two astronauts holoported from ground to station.
862.13s - 869.95s |  This one didn't work, but at least you can see the picture of these guys holoported from ground to the station.
869.95s - 876.76s |  Maybe it worked.
876.76s - 881.76s |  Before I move forward, we have been doing these holoportations for a while.
881.76s - 887.76s |  Let me just show you a quick video and walk you through these first holoportations on a station.
887.76s - 894.67s |  So that's Dr. Joe Smith during the first holoportation.
894.67s - 899.67s |  That's one of the crew members with a hololens interacting with Dr. Smith.
899.67s - 905.07s |  That's Dr. Smith as a hologram on a station.
905.07s - 911.64s |  Again, Dr. Smith on the ground, holoported to the station as a hologram.
911.64s - 918.42s |  Some of the crew members interacting with Dr. Smith.
918.42s - 922.42s |  That's me and Dr. Smith on a station.
922.42s - 936.38s |  That's Mark Patty before he was holoported from station to the ground.
936.38s - 947.84s |  That's Mark Patty floating at mission control as a hologram.
947.84s - 964.57s |  That's Thomas Pesquet, a French astronaut, interacting with a bunch of physicians during one medical evaluation.
964.57s - 969.57s |  So then from the media perspective, it was viral.
969.57s - 972.57s |  We went through CBS. We went to multiple media channels.
972.57s - 981.57s |  I'm going to skip on this one, but the media was very interested on this one.
981.57s - 983.57s |  Finally, NASA gave me an award.
983.57s - 989.57s |  We won the NASA Innovation of the Year award, which was good.
989.57s - 993.57s |  But then something happened, which was pretty interesting.
993.57s - 998.57s |  So during one of the holoportations, imagine the space station is small.
998.57s - 1002.57s |  It's the same size as a football field.
1002.57s - 1008.57s |  The crew live on a station between six months to a full year, so they know each other.
1008.57s - 1013.57s |  They know every single corner of the station, and the astronauts are very smart.
1013.57s - 1018.57s |  What happened before this holoportation, one of the crew members, Kayla Barron,
1018.57s - 1023.57s |  she was waiting for Dr. Smith to appear for the medical evaluation.
1023.57s - 1025.57s |  She got distracted for a second.
1025.57s - 1032.57s |  She moved her head to the left, and she floated forward a little bit, like a couple of inches,
1032.57s - 1038.57s |  moved her head back forward, and a hologram of Dr. Smith was in front of her,
1038.57s - 1042.57s |  and she shouted, like, hey, go back. You're invading my personal space.
1042.57s - 1046.57s |  And then she stopped, and she laughed, and she said, Houston,
1046.57s - 1050.57s |  I never believed that a hologram can invade my personal space, but that happened.
1050.57s - 1056.57s |  But that was very important because at that point, the Human Health Performance Division at NASA told me,
1056.57s - 1062.57s |  Space Medicine told me, like, hey, if in her mind the doctor was there, this is very powerful
1062.57s - 1065.57s |  because at least for a second she believed that the doctor was there.
1065.57s - 1069.57s |  Let me show you the video. I believe this one has audio.
1070.57s - 1078.94s |  Something that isn't just predefined.
1078.94s - 1082.94s |  Houston Station reporting that I can now hear audio.
1082.94s - 1088.94s |  The hologram image, however, has gotten really, really close to me.
1088.94s - 1095.94s |  Didn't know a hologram could invade my personal space, but it's happening.
1095.94s - 1097.94s |  So that was so nice.
1097.94s - 1102.94s |  So what happened, Dr. Smith came again with me and said, hey, Fernando, what else can we do?
1102.94s - 1108.94s |  And I say, well, what if we really build a holodeck, a room that doesn't require glasses,
1108.94s - 1116.94s |  technology that we don't require those special $4,000 VisionPros or Hololens,
1116.94s - 1127.94s |  and we create a way that whatever is happening on the moon, we can see it in this room from ceiling, floor, all the walls.
1127.94s - 1131.94s |  So you can bring a subject matter expert if they need to fix something.
1131.94s - 1140.94s |  You can bring family members. You can bring personnel for training, future astronauts, also politicians.
1140.94s - 1144.94s |  I said, OK, let's do it. So we're building four holodecks.
1144.94s - 1150.94s |  This one was we put it on the operation in October 2023.
1150.94s - 1154.94s |  It's at the Johnson Space Center, building 268.
1154.94s - 1157.94s |  And that's Joe making a little message.
1157.94s - 1159.94s |  Welcome to the future.
1159.94s - 1163.94s |  We are now experiencing what our astronauts experience on board the International Space Station.
1163.94s - 1166.94s |  We were all aboard the space station.
1166.94s - 1169.94s |  Now I'm all afforded to view there in the holodeck.
1169.94s - 1177.94s |  The future is now.
1177.94s - 1184.94s |  So when that happened, we when I say we as my company, we came with the idea like, hey, this is very powerful.
1184.94s - 1190.94s |  We are at least five companies working in different ways to use Holoportation.
1190.94s - 1194.94s |  There is Microsoft, which we have a great partnership with them.
1194.94s - 1203.94s |  There is Google. They are launching a special device that is like a telephone booth, but it's two way.
1203.94s - 1208.94s |  You can see the other person. That price will be like one million dollars, which is pretty cool.
1208.94s - 1212.94s |  There is a company in California. We have a very good relation with them.
1212.94s - 1224.94s |  The name of the company is Portal. It's also you walk into a studio and then you have a telephone booth on the other side and you can see yourself like you're inside a box.
1224.94s - 1227.94s |  And that's pretty cool. It's $150,000.
1227.94s - 1232.94s |  There is Samsung trying to do something meta, Cisco, Webex.
1232.94s - 1237.94s |  They also have some technology based on those glasses, the magic lips and the HoloLens.
1237.94s - 1241.94s |  And I was like, hey, this is very powerful, but it's very expensive.
1241.94s - 1245.94s |  What if we figure out a way to make this device agnostic?
1245.94s - 1250.94s |  What if we also figure out a way to project the HoloLens without the glasses?
1250.94s - 1258.94s |  So, again, when I say we, it's my company, we took the decision to split the company to two companies,
1258.94s - 1267.94s |  Aerospace, which serves the government, the U.S. government, and AXA Tech, which will serve the commercial market.
1267.94s - 1275.94s |  And then we came with the idea like, hey, a lot of people from here, maybe they have a Kinect camera from their Xbox, but not all the people have that.
1275.94s - 1279.94s |  But everyone has this. Everyone has a cell phone.
1279.94s - 1283.94s |  What if we can capture a three dimensional hologram with this camera?
1283.94s - 1291.94s |  And what if instead of telling you what device you need to use to visualize the hologram,
1291.94s - 1303.94s |  you can use the fancy HoloLens or Vision Pros, or you can use a $300 MetaQuest 3 device, or you can use also a smartphone or a tablet.
1303.94s - 1307.94s |  Right now, my technology works on 2,300 devices.
1307.94s - 1312.94s |  And I will show you the QR code right now for a limited time. It's free.
1313.94s - 1320.94s |  Because I really believe that this technology can help a lot of people, not only in space, everywhere.
1320.94s - 1325.94s |  And also, we will be able to create more applications based on this technology.
1325.94s - 1333.94s |  And also, from the other side, a lot of people either with augmented reality or mixed reality or virtual reality, some people, they don't like it.
1333.94s - 1339.94s |  So we built a device called HoloConnector, which we have two sizes.
1339.94s - 1348.94s |  One is the human size. The other one is table size, which will help you to project holograms without glasses.
1348.94s - 1356.94s |  So my technology, we made it available. We launched this device during a comic convention in Houston, Comicpalooza.
1356.94s - 1364.94s |  Then we made the official presentation at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C. two weeks ago.
1365.94s - 1372.94s |  So trying to figure out something, and what you can see there, there's people and the holograms projected next to them.
1372.94s - 1375.94s |  And you can play with this technology as well.
1375.94s - 1383.91s |  And this is kind of a render of the HoloConnector.
1383.91s - 1387.91s |  And now let me share a story before I go back to the application.
1387.91s - 1389.91s |  I have two children, and they say,
1390.91s - 1394.91s |  You should be an influencer and interview people with your technology.
1394.91s - 1400.91s |  And I was like, eh, I'm not an influencer, and I'm not that kind of guy.
1400.91s - 1407.91s |  But I'm going to show you how being an influencer is just fake and is not going to work.
1407.91s - 1412.91s |  So I launched a YouTube channel, which you can join if you want to. There's a QR code.
1412.91s - 1416.91s |  I started interviewing people with my technology as holograms.
1416.91s - 1421.91s |  And later on, you will be able to visualize these interviews as holograms as well.
1421.91s - 1426.91s |  For instance, I have one of the guys that invented the Internet, Dr. Vinton Cerf.
1426.91s - 1428.91s |  I have so many people.
1428.91s - 1433.91s |  And then after one month, YouTube sent me this creator award.
1433.91s - 1435.91s |  Like, now you are an influencer.
1435.91s - 1438.91s |  Right now, I believe we reached 3.5 million views.
1438.91s - 1442.91s |  We reached 650,000 subscribers.
1442.91s - 1445.91s |  And right now I'm receiving a check every month.
1445.91s - 1448.91s |  And I was like, yeah, this story really backfired me.
1448.91s - 1451.91s |  But I noticed, like, this technology is really powerful.
1451.91s - 1456.91s |  So I decided to make it available for anyone and go from there.
1459.91s - 1462.91s |  Because the applications are unlimited.
1462.91s - 1466.91s |  You can have your mechanic next to your car and helping you.
1466.91s - 1471.91s |  You can take your best buddy to you during a trip, capture unique memories.
1471.91s - 1474.91s |  You can do whatever you want to.
1474.91s - 1479.91s |  So that's why, and hopefully you can scan this one,
1479.91s - 1483.91s |  I decided with my company to make this technology available for anyone.
1483.91s - 1485.91s |  Right now it's free.
1485.91s - 1488.91s |  At some point, we're going to charge like $9 a month
1488.91s - 1493.91s |  because we don't really want to make money and charge you a lot of money.
1493.91s - 1495.91s |  We want people to use this technology.
1495.91s - 1498.91s |  At some point, we're going to release a software developer kit
1498.91s - 1501.91s |  so you can use this technology as a testbed
1501.91s - 1506.91s |  because I believe that we can lead the market of holographic communications.
1506.91s - 1513.91s |  Right now I have surgeons from the Houston Medical Center training people in Africa.
1513.91s - 1517.91s |  And we reduce the bandwidth from 5 megabits per second to 1 megabit per second
1517.91s - 1520.91s |  because you don't have great coverage on those areas.
1520.91s - 1525.91s |  So the real idea is to help not only medicine but help anyone.
1525.91s - 1529.91s |  So if you want to download it, it's free for now.
1529.91s - 1537.91s |  And saying that, I tried to go fast, especially because I started late,
1537.91s - 1541.91s |  but also to give you the opportunity to make questions.
1541.91s - 1544.91s |  So if you have any questions, I believe that we have some time.
1544.91s - 1546.91s |  Hopefully you like my presentation.
1546.91s - 1547.91s |  I tried to rush.
1547.91s - 1550.91s |  I know that you have a very full program today,
1550.91s - 1553.91s |  so I don't want to bore you during your first session.
1553.91s - 1556.91s |  And thank you so much for being here.
1557.91s - 1563.44s |  And with this light, I cannot see you.
1563.44s - 1565.44s |  It's like an interrogation room.
1565.44s - 1570.44s |  So if someone has a question, just let me know or try to do something,
1570.44s - 1573.44s |  turn on your device, and I will be happy to answer it.
1573.44s - 1591.62s |  Ideally, we love to have 5 megabits per second.
1591.62s - 1594.62s |  Right now it's working with 1 megabit per second.
1594.62s - 1600.62s |  And we are going to release a way to make it like ultra-high definition.
1600.62s - 1607.62s |  The biggest milestone is to get it like maybe 12 megabits per second
1607.62s - 1609.62s |  for ultra-high definition.
1609.62s - 1612.62s |  But what's going to happen is, and that's important,
1612.62s - 1617.62s |  every two weeks we push an update so the technology is changing every two weeks.
1617.62s - 1621.62s |  And I want this technology to make it your technology.
1621.62s - 1625.62s |  So every time that we have input, let me give you an example,
1625.62s - 1628.62s |  and I'm going to go back to your question.
1628.62s - 1632.62s |  Someday I receive an email like, hey, Fernando, can you add a selfie mode?
1632.62s - 1635.62s |  And I was like, what? A selfie mode?
1635.62s - 1638.62s |  Yeah, I want to love to have pictures or videos with my friends
1638.62s - 1640.62s |  while I'm on vacation.
1640.62s - 1642.62s |  I was like, okay, and we did it.
1642.62s - 1647.62s |  So every time someone comes with a question or a suggestion, we implement it.
1647.62s - 1651.62s |  Right now it's working with 1 up to 5 megabits per second.
1651.62s - 1656.62s |  We have in the backlog a way that if you have 12 megabits per second,
1656.62s - 1658.62s |  at some point it's going to take the 12,
1658.62s - 1662.62s |  and it will ask you if you want to go to like ultra-high definition.
1662.62s - 1665.62s |  And if not, you can go to 5 or 1.
1665.62s - 1670.62s |  Now, with 12, we have something called haptics, and I forgot to mention that.
1670.62s - 1675.62s |  With haptics, what happens, we have a glove that is 300 bucks
1675.62s - 1677.62s |  and some other equipment.
1677.62s - 1680.62s |  And as a surgeon, and I'm not a physician,
1680.62s - 1685.62s |  they just touch the patient as a hologram, take the lymph nodes,
1685.62s - 1688.62s |  and they do have an infection, and they do their magic.
1688.62s - 1691.62s |  We have been doing that, and that's part of the technology
1691.62s - 1693.62s |  that we're releasing to the public,
1693.62s - 1697.62s |  the capability of having the essence of the other person there
1697.62s - 1701.62s |  and also the capability of feeling the other person.
1701.62s - 1703.62s |  And right now it's multiplayer.
1703.62s - 1707.62s |  We can have up to four people at the same time during one session.
1707.62s - 1709.62s |  You create your own rooms.
1709.62s - 1712.62s |  But at some point, we want to make it unlimited,
1712.62s - 1715.62s |  at least have 300 people or more per room,
1715.62s - 1720.62s |  so you have a concert or an event, you can invite anyone.
1720.62s - 1725.62s |  Any other question?
1725.62s - 1727.62s |  If you have a question, just try to raise your hand
1727.62s - 1730.62s |  because I cannot really see from here.
1730.62s - 1740.62s |  Okay.
1740.62s - 1742.62s |  So the question is if I have competition.
1742.62s - 1746.62s |  And yes, we do have a bunch.
1746.62s - 1750.62s |  We play nice with at least four.
1750.62s - 1753.62s |  Meta or Zuckerberg, they are trying to do this.
1753.62s - 1756.62s |  It's not live, but they're trying to create
1756.62s - 1759.62s |  this holoportation technology as well.
1759.62s - 1763.62s |  Cisco, Webex, they call it Webex Hologram.
1763.62s - 1768.62s |  They have a way to capture holograms for two people.
1768.62s - 1770.62s |  You have a special rail of cameras,
1770.62s - 1772.62s |  and you need to have the Webex Business Edition,
1772.62s - 1774.62s |  and you need to have the HoloLens,
1774.62s - 1777.62s |  which is pretty cool but pretty expensive,
1777.62s - 1779.62s |  but that's one market.
1779.62s - 1782.62s |  Samsung, we don't play with them.
1782.62s - 1783.62s |  We tried to reach to them.
1783.62s - 1785.62s |  They didn't respond.
1785.62s - 1788.62s |  Because what I'm trying to do is to play nice with everyone
1788.62s - 1793.62s |  so we can create a standard of these same practices.
1793.62s - 1795.62s |  Microsoft, we have been playing very nice with them.
1795.62s - 1800.62s |  Actually, they added an article on their website about us
1800.62s - 1802.62s |  because also we use Microsoft technology.
1802.62s - 1805.62s |  Apple, we're playing nice with them.
1805.62s - 1808.62s |  Portal as well and Google as well.
1808.62s - 1810.62s |  They are different technologies.
1810.62s - 1814.62s |  Ours is the only one that is portable,
1814.62s - 1817.62s |  multiplayer, device agnostic.
1817.62s - 1819.62s |  And I don't want to challenge you.
1819.62s - 1821.62s |  I will be careful to say that here,
1821.62s - 1824.62s |  but it's pretty secure.
1824.62s - 1827.62s |  It's encrypted because we developed this technology for NASA
1827.62s - 1829.62s |  and the Department of Defense.
1829.62s - 1831.62s |  So it's not unhackable.
1831.62s - 1834.62s |  Don't try it, but try that technology.
1834.62s - 1836.62s |  But we try to make it pretty secure
1836.62s - 1841.62s |  because if you are having a HoloPortation session with anyone,
1841.62s - 1844.62s |  if it's happening, we don't have a way to know it.
1844.62s - 1846.62s |  Whatever happened is your stuff,
1846.62s - 1849.62s |  and we don't have a way to access it because it's your privacy.
1849.62s - 1854.62s |  We know that sometimes in medicine there are a lot of sensitive issues
1854.62s - 1858.62s |  or deployed military personnel overseas.
1858.62s - 1860.62s |  They want to meet with their family.
1860.62s - 1862.62s |  So we don't really capture that.
1862.62s - 1867.62s |  So we try to keep privacy and make it pretty secure.
1867.62s - 1870.62s |  Is there any other question?
1870.62s - 1874.62s |  If you have one, just raise your hand or shout.
1874.62s - 1904.98s |  You have one over there.
1904.98s - 1906.98s |  So the question is if we are using more haptics
1906.98s - 1909.98s |  other than big haptics or haptics feedback.
1909.98s - 1912.98s |  Yes, at NASA we have a base and we have a full suit
1912.98s - 1916.98s |  that has also a compressor, which is huge.
1916.98s - 1918.98s |  The sensitivity is better.
1918.98s - 1922.98s |  So you can feel with that kind of haptics,
1922.98s - 1926.98s |  if you are touching a holographic cat versus a holographic table,
1926.98s - 1929.98s |  you can feel it.
1929.98s - 1932.98s |  So we have two versions of this technology,
1932.98s - 1935.98s |  the government version, which is with aerospace,
1935.98s - 1938.98s |  and the commercial version, which is with AXA Tech.
1938.98s - 1941.98s |  We are trying to match both technologies.
1941.98s - 1944.98s |  Of course, the government version has more features,
1944.98s - 1946.98s |  more bells and whistles.
1946.98s - 1948.98s |  That's why on the commercial version,
1948.98s - 1951.98s |  we have used a glove that costs $300.
1951.98s - 1953.98s |  But it's compatible, and at some point,
1953.98s - 1957.98s |  I believe that people will be more engaged using the fancy haptics.
1957.98s - 1960.98s |  But for government, yes, we have the full base.
1960.98s - 1966.98s |  For the commercial version, we only have the glove.
1966.98s - 1973.98s |  Is there any other question?
1973.98s - 1984.98s |  I have one there, yeah.
1984.98s - 1989.98s |  Yes, so let me tell you, yes.
1989.98s - 1993.98s |  So if we go to Mars, let's say we have a crew on Mars,
1993.98s - 1997.98s |  and we're working on that one on the NASA version.
1997.98s - 2000.98s |  There is a delay in the communications between 16 to 32 minutes
2000.98s - 2002.98s |  for a two-way communication.
2002.98s - 2004.98s |  So imagine you are on Mars.
2004.98s - 2005.98s |  You have an accident.
2005.98s - 2010.98s |  You are bleeding and say, Houston, this is Mars.
2010.98s - 2011.98s |  I'm bleeding.
2011.98s - 2014.98s |  Thirty-two minutes later, they will say, from where?
2014.98s - 2016.98s |  You may be dead by then.
2016.98s - 2020.98s |  So according to the Space Medicine Division at NASA,
2020.98s - 2024.98s |  there are about 440 basic medical diagnostics.
2024.98s - 2029.98s |  So what we're trying to do is to put AI for this medical purpose.
2029.98s - 2033.98s |  So if you have an emergency on Mars or the moon,
2033.98s - 2037.98s |  the first thing that you're going to see is a hologram of a doctor
2037.98s - 2041.98s |  trying to give you at least the basic procedures
2041.98s - 2045.98s |  to keep you away from a bigger danger.
2045.98s - 2049.98s |  And then the biggest challenge for us is that at some point,
2049.98s - 2052.98s |  the communication from air will arrive,
2052.98s - 2056.98s |  and the biggest challenge for us is that the crew member or the astronaut
2056.98s - 2060.98s |  will not notice if he or she is still talking with the hologram,
2060.98s - 2062.98s |  with the AI, or the person.
2062.98s - 2066.98s |  But, yes, we are integrating that under the Space Medicine Division
2066.98s - 2073.98s |  because just having a 32-minute delay in the communications is a lot.
2073.98s - 2078.98s |  And at some point, I plan to integrate that also in the commercial version.
2078.98s - 2085.98s |  Any other questions?
2085.98s - 2089.98s |  Okay. Well, thank you so much for your time.
2089.98s - 2092.98s |  If you can, download the app. It's not perfect.
2092.98s - 2095.98s |  Every two weeks, we are pushing an update.
2095.98s - 2098.98s |  What we want is to have an app that is working for you,
2098.98s - 2102.98s |  available for anyone like you, and designed by you, by the people,
2102.98s - 2105.98s |  by users for something that you really like,
2105.98s - 2107.98s |  instead of us just coming with an idea and saying,
2107.98s - 2109.98s |  hey, this is how it's going to work.
2109.98s - 2112.98s |  So you can just download it, give us your feedback,
2112.98s - 2122.98s |  and we will try to tailor the application to your designs or your needs.
2122.98s - 2124.98s |  Okay? Thank you so much.
2124.98s - 2128.98s |  And if you need me, that's my email, if you want also to email me.
2128.98s - 2130.98s |  Thank you.
