  "description": "Talking to pilots and operators, an important aspect of GPS spoofing and jamming is being missed from the narrative in the media. We know about position spoofing, that's a given. What doesn't appear to be getting much attention is the effect of time spoofing.\n\nThe most significant of these is an incident where time was spoofed a significant period into the future. This caused all digital certificates on board an aircraft to become invalid and caused all electronic communications to fail. As GPS clocks have protection against time being rolled backwards, but not forward, the aircraft was grounded for several weeks for systems to be reflashed and the clocks to be reset,\n\nCoarse time spoofing could therefore ground entire fleets. We'll discuss this and potential mitigations. If time allows, we could touch on conventional RF navaids and their exposure to similar attacks.",

0.00s - 8.80s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Well, good afternoon. Now, I'm here to talk about time, time particularly in aviation.
9.52s - 14.16s |  Now, we're going to be talking about GNSS, GPS, of course, which you know,
14.16s - 19.12s |  GPS is a subset of GNSS. And forgive me because I switched between the two terms
19.12s - 22.80s |  a few times during the presentation. So let's use them interchangeably for the moment.
22.80s - 29.20s |  Now, a little bit about me and the organisation I work for. We are red teamers and pen testers,
29.20s - 34.80s |  but we spend a lot of time working in aviation. During COVID, a lot of airplanes were laid up
34.80s - 39.20s |  and we got to do some vanilla research working on retired airplanes, which is great fun.
39.76s - 43.60s |  You learn a great deal very quickly about some very new and very old systems too.
44.32s - 48.96s |  Along the way, we've advised several airlines, several manufacturers. We're on very good terms
48.96s - 56.00s |  with Boeing. And we've had the great opportunity to do some vanilla research on systems such as
56.00s - 61.44s |  collision avoidance systems, instrument landing systems, and also electronic flight bags,
61.44s - 70.08s |  which I gave a talk about yesterday. Anyway, who am I? Well, I'm a really bad pilot. I have had
70.08s - 74.88s |  so many bad incidents happen to me. I've landed at the wrong airport by mistake once. That was
74.88s - 79.36s |  embarrassing. I had my engine quit on me once. Fortunately, it happened just after I took off,
79.36s - 84.48s |  the runway was long, we were fine. I've had my undercarriage hang up twice. That was a bit
84.48s - 88.88s |  awkward. And I've very nearly crashed into three other airplanes. So whatever you do, don't fly
88.88s - 93.44s |  with me. It's really bad. Navigationally, I also accidentally trolled air traffic control. I was
93.44s - 97.52s |  there when I was actually there. That caused a bit of a consternation as well. But hey,
98.64s - 104.48s |  fortunately for you, I never made it to commercial. I studied, but I never made it
104.48s - 110.08s |  to the airlines, which was a bit of a shame. So instead, back in 2002, I founded a pen testing
110.08s - 114.72s |  firm. But I do still fly in general aviation and the sort of fun things I like flying.
115.36s - 120.64s |  My favourite airplane is the Piper Cherokee 6. I love it. I also went out to Eastern Europe to
120.64s - 126.16s |  learn to fly old Russian airliners, which are great fun. I fly multi-engine airplanes too.
126.16s - 132.08s |  But probably the scariest thing I ever did was flew into Courchevel-Alteport, which is in Courchevel
132.08s - 138.08s |  in France. It was built for 1992 Olympics. And the runway is at an angle of 20 degrees.
139.12s - 144.40s |  If you come in and you get it wrong, basically you crash. You can't put the power on, go around
144.40s - 148.00s |  and try again because there's a mountain in the way. And often what happens, and if you go to
148.00s - 153.68s |  YouTube, you'll see this, is people land with a bit too much speed and come screeching across the
153.68s - 159.12s |  ramp, brakes on fire and go ploughing into the snow bank. There's quite a recent one of a Piper
159.12s - 164.56s |  Aztec that went piling in. What they don't show you in the photograph is there is a bar right on
164.56s - 169.20s |  the left there with a viewing gallery and everyone sits there and waits for the airplanes to crash.
170.32s - 175.44s |  Amazingly, in the 30-something years it's been open, only two people have been very
175.44s - 179.60s |  seriously injured in that time. But they do have lots of crazy things. Anyway,
181.20s - 186.72s |  I want to talk about what I'm not. I am not an expert in GPS. It's not my field. I'm not a
186.72s - 192.80s |  commercial pilot, fortunately for you. But what I do want to talk about is a series of incidents
192.80s - 199.04s |  that I've been told about, that have been published, some haven't, and I'm not going to give answers.
199.92s - 204.88s |  What I think I would like to stimulate from this is hopefully your interest in the space too.
205.76s - 209.92s |  Go and start asking questions. Go and start learning about GPS and go and learn about some of
209.92s - 213.60s |  the interesting issues that we've started seeing over the last couple of years.
214.16s - 220.48s |  So I spend a lot of time working in aviation. I know quite a bit about flying airplanes. I know
220.48s - 224.80s |  quite a bit of the navigation systems. I know quite a bit about the cyber security of airplanes
224.80s - 229.84s |  too and I know lots of airlines. We're on very good terms with all sorts. I also know about people
229.84s - 237.04s |  and how pilots interact, how we manage the cockpit resources and why things go wrong. I have this
237.04s - 244.72s |  very weird fascination with reading incident reports about aviation crashes. One thing I love
244.72s - 250.24s |  more than anything about the aviation industry, it is safe. And the reason it's safe is we find
250.24s - 256.08s |  out what went wrong. Then we write it up without blame and we share it. Imagine if we could do that
256.08s - 263.04s |  in the cyber security industry, hey? That is why flying is so safe. Anyway, just before we go there,
263.76s - 269.20s |  it's really, really important. If you find vulnerabilities in aviation, you disclose them
269.20s - 274.96s |  responsibly and ethically. It takes a long time to fix things in airplanes. Why? Because we need
274.96s - 280.72s |  to be safe. You can't go and drop it like it's hot in aviation. You can't do 90 days Google
280.72s - 287.92s |  Project Zero style. Code in aviation has to be certified to make sure it's safe. You can't just
287.92s - 294.08s |  push a patch to a plane. It can take a couple of years to fix a vulnerability on an airplane.
294.08s - 299.44s |  And for those of you who've seen press reports about planes being hacked from a seat backing
299.44s - 304.64s |  coach, no, it doesn't work like that. You can't. The networks are segregated. They don't do that.
304.64s - 308.96s |  And there's always someone in control up front. When everything else goes wrong,
308.96s - 313.44s |  you've got pilots up there and that's what they're paid to do. They're paid to fly safely.
313.44s - 317.44s |  So a little bit of a recap. We need to go back to basics. We're going to go back to what I like to
317.44s - 323.12s |  think of as steam powered instance. One of the very earliest types of navigational aid was
323.12s - 328.56s |  a non-directional beacon. It's simply got an indicator in your cockpit that points at the
328.56s - 333.92s |  beacon. It's as simple as that. Very straightforward. Has very long range because it follows the
333.92s - 338.88s |  curvature of the earth. Unfortunately, there are some weaknesses, one of which being if you're
338.88s - 344.64s |  navigating in instrument conditions, so in cloud and there's thunderstorms going on, it'll point at
344.64s - 348.40s |  the thunderstorm. So you fly towards the thunderstorm instead of where you were hoping to
348.40s - 355.68s |  go. Very cheap to operate. And you often find them in very remote locations. So northern Canada,
355.68s - 360.32s |  there are still quite a lot of NDBs around because they've got great range, cheap to operate, and
360.32s - 364.24s |  there's not a huge amount of aviation traffic out there at low level. You do still find them.
364.24s - 368.64s |  They'll often be the markers or locators on an instrument landing system. So as you fly in,
368.64s - 371.76s |  if you lift in the cockpit, you hear the outer marker, middle marker, inner marker.
373.89s - 382.13s |  Huge advances were made with the VOR. These came to be used in I think 1947 when they first emerged
382.13s - 387.97s |  and they were not affected by the same issues with NDBs. They didn't point at thunderstorms and make
387.97s - 392.85s |  you fly into lightning, which is great. We like that. They're probably easier to use and follow
393.57s - 398.05s |  and they're undoubtedly more accurate, but they are only line of sight. NDB follows the curvature
398.05s - 405.25s |  of the earth. VOR, line of sight. And these are typically found at the intersections of airways.
405.25s - 410.61s |  When you're flying airway to airway, a turning point will often be accompanied by a VOR on the
410.61s - 414.13s |  ground. And if you're ever looking out of the window and you feel the airplane turn,
414.13s - 418.13s |  you might want to look down and you might just see this round thing on the ground. That's a VOR.
419.17s - 425.17s |  But they are expensive. They're expensive to maintain and they don't give you altitude
425.17s - 434.93s |  information. They give you a direction, whereas GPS gives you very precise point in space and time.
436.93s - 441.97s |  So because they're quite expensive to maintain, because we've got GPS, which is a lot better,
441.97s - 448.13s |  they're starting to be retired. They're starting to disappear. We also use DME, which is
448.13s - 452.21s |  essentially a bit like a submarine ping. You send a ping, get a response, time of flight gives you
452.21s - 456.77s |  distance. And it's actually very accurate. We use DME typically on an instrument landing system
456.77s - 461.33s |  approach. At some point during that approach, we will check DME to make sure that we occur the
461.33s - 468.50s |  correct distance from the runway. ILS. You've probably seen these. You see them at the end
468.50s - 475.94s |  of the runway. Yeah, that's the localizer. They're amazing bits of equipment, incredibly precise,
475.94s - 482.10s |  given it's radio based and allows us to make an approach in what we call Cat 3C. So completely
482.10s - 488.02s |  fogged out, the airplane can still land safely with a combination of a radio altimeter. The only
488.02s - 495.86s |  minor issue with the instrument landing system is it can give false glide slopes. So typically an
495.86s - 503.54s |  ILS is aligned at a three degrees angle and you'll also have false signals at six degrees, so multiples
504.34s - 510.74s |  nine degrees, 12, etc. So as a result of that, we always used to approach the instrument landing
510.74s - 518.42s |  system by flying under it. We'd intersect the glide slope and then we'd get clearance to descend.
518.42s - 522.98s |  So we wouldn't typically approach from above because you might end up picking up one of the
522.98s - 529.38s |  false GPS approaches. But they're really expensive to maintain. They're incredibly expensive to build
529.94s - 533.86s |  and they're incredibly expensive to maintain because you have to calibrate them. And there's
533.86s - 539.38s |  this incredible process involving mirrors. So there'll be mirrors set up on the runway and
539.38s - 543.54s |  then you'll have a calibration airplane will then fly down, signing lasers off the mirrors,
543.54s - 549.70s |  make sure it's correctly calibrated. It's expensive. As a result of that, a lot of regional
549.70s - 555.62s |  airports are starting to retire their instrument landing systems. Why? Because we've got GPS. GPS
555.62s - 564.26s |  is more accurate. Fantastic. And you're starting to see LPV approaches take over where ILS was
564.26s - 571.30s |  used before. An example of that, so runway 19 right hand in Las Vegas itself is a GPS approach.
572.34s - 576.26s |  The other major runways still have instrument landing systems, but if you're approaching from
576.26s - 584.74s |  the north, you'll typically find a GPS based approach. We also use inertial reference. So
584.74s - 591.86s |  back in the day, when you were flying something like a 707, you had a navigator on board and that
591.86s - 597.06s |  navigator would have had a sextant and there was also a periscope in the roof like there is on the
597.06s - 602.74s |  B52 and they would literally do celestial sightings using a sextant and work out where they are.
603.54s - 610.10s |  Now we no longer have navigators. We don't really have that option. So inertial reference was used,
610.10s - 613.86s |  particularly where we're not flying over land, where we don't have ground based beacons.
613.86s - 619.14s |  And it means that simply relying on a very, very accurate accelerometer, the one on the right is
619.30s - 626.10s |  the inertial reference system from Concorde, gyro based, and the one on the left is the much
626.10s - 632.18s |  more recent version, which is laser based gyros. They are so accurate that on a 3000 nautical mile
632.18s - 637.94s |  flight from say London to New York, you could be as little as one nautical mile off position,
637.94s - 643.22s |  which is phenomenal advances, but actually not great if you then want to approach and land.
644.18s - 648.34s |  You need to be a bit better than one nautical mile away from the runway. That'd be a bad day.
649.62s - 655.94s |  So as we're starting to see conventional nav aids start to be retired because they're expensive and
655.94s - 661.94s |  not as accurate, we're starting to see them being removed. And particularly the VORs that are off
661.94s - 668.66s |  airway routes, they're being retired. There's also a lot of VORs are still part of the approach. So
668.66s - 673.30s |  for example, a standard approach route or a standard instrument departure will often involve
673.38s - 679.78s |  a VOR. One of my favourite, why do I have a favourite VOR? I don't know. There's a proposal
679.78s - 684.98s |  to recover Delta Tango, sorry, retired Delta Tango Yankee, which is a critical part or was
684.98s - 691.95s |  a critical part of a number of the standard approaches into London's Heathrow. 10 years ago,
691.95s - 699.63s |  we had 44 VORs in the UK, we're now down to below 19. So we're starting to rely increasingly
700.27s - 706.83s |  on GPS. Now let's look at some of the incidents that we've stumbled onto. I would strongly
706.83s - 710.11s |  recommend if you want to learn more about this, go and follow the Ops Group. Really
710.11s - 715.23s |  interesting grouping, gathering data, have real time GPS spoofing and jamming reports.
716.43s - 722.35s |  As I'm sure you've started to see, we're starting to see position errors, particularly around areas
722.35s - 728.03s |  of conflict. There's a lot going on in Eastern Europe and Ukraine, obviously. And part of that,
728.03s - 732.67s |  we believe, is there to mitigate drone-based attacks. A lot of consumer drones rather than
732.67s - 737.39s |  military drones are being used. They rely on GPS in some cases. So to mitigate an attack,
737.95s - 744.19s |  you would jam or spoof GPS. We saw a lot of jamming and spoofing going on in the Black Sea,
744.19s - 748.27s |  but that was typically for shipping. So around military installations in the Black Sea,
748.27s - 755.17s |  you'd often get a 20 nautical mile position error when you were at sea. It's increased massively
755.17s - 760.53s |  though. The last report I read had a 400% increase, which is huge. We're seeing moves
760.53s - 767.41s |  away from jamming towards position errors. Position can be incredibly interesting. Now,
768.05s - 773.09s |  for safety reasons, when we're approaching to land, we will have the ground proximity
773.09s - 778.61s |  warning system. So if we descend too low or we start flying towards hills, which would be really
778.61s - 785.97s |  bad, the GPWS will give us an alert and say, too low, pull up. But if you've got a position error,
785.97s - 791.09s |  you're flying down your ILS, the GPWS thinks you're somewhere else because it's being spoofed
791.65s - 798.21s |  and triggers. First thing you have to do is go around. So we're seeing numerous flights have to
798.21s - 802.45s |  go around and try again because they're getting position errors that are triggering the ground
802.45s - 810.05s |  proximity. We're also seeing some interesting issues around poisoning. Now, inertial reference,
810.05s - 814.21s |  I mentioned there, it's not as accurate, right? It's great, but it's not as accurate as GPS.
814.85s - 819.97s |  So therefore we would deprecate to GPS as the most accurate source of position and time on
819.97s - 827.57s |  the airplane. So the IRS will be updated by the GPS pretty frequently. So when we start to see
827.57s - 832.69s |  position errors, what we're then starting to see is inertial reference then becomes poisoned
832.69s - 838.45s |  by GPS. And when the instructions to pilots is if you are experiencing spoofing or likely to
838.45s - 843.89s |  experience spoofing, you would then switch from GPS to inertial reference so you don't see poisoning
843.89s - 854.08s |  going on. We've seen anecdotal reports pop up around airplanes not able to reacquire. You go
854.08s - 861.12s |  into an area of spoofing, you lose GPS, you then leave the area of spoofing and jamming
862.48s - 868.16s |  some distance later. Now, in order to see the satellites in the skies, you need to know where
868.16s - 872.48s |  they are. And that's your satellite almanac, which is part of a GPS system. The multimode receivers,
872.48s - 879.60s |  which will gather that data, we've seen reports where you get beyond the jamming area and the MMR
879.60s - 883.28s |  can't now reacquire the signal because the satellites aren't where it thinks they are.
884.80s - 889.68s |  There have been all sorts of reports of course position jamming causing problems around areas
889.68s - 894.64s |  of perhaps what we might call hostile airspace, places we wouldn't really want to fly into where
894.64s - 899.68s |  maybe it's a war zone or an unfriendly hostile nation. You do not want to be accidentally flying
899.68s - 905.84s |  into their airspace. That reset process, if they're no longer working, needs to be done on
905.84s - 911.52s |  the ground so the planes are no longer moving, it can reacquire correctly. Interestingly,
911.52s - 915.28s |  more modern multimode receivers don't seem to be as vulnerable. They seem to be better at
915.28s - 918.72s |  reacquiring afterwards compared to some of the older multimode receivers that are in
918.72s - 922.08s |  slightly older airplanes. Really interesting. I haven't got to the bottom of that.
923.36s - 930.64s |  Now, when we do see GPS jamming and spoofing going on, there'll often be a notice to airmen,
930.64s - 935.68s |  a NOTAM, and that tells the pilots, look, you're really likely to receive some jamming or spoofing
936.32s - 945.20s |  there. So before you go there, switch. But remember, we're retiring older base nav-aids.
945.20s - 949.76s |  We're starting to retire our instrument landing systems in favour of GPS. But now we've got
949.76s - 956.40s |  position problems. There was a really interesting incident at Tartu airport in Estonia. So Finnair
956.40s - 961.68s |  suspended their flights, they were flying ATR-72s in there I believe, and they started to experience
962.24s - 967.60s |  GPS spoofing and jamming and couldn't safely approach the airport. So they suspended flights
967.60s - 972.16s |  for a couple of months while they looked for other sources of data and they ended up settling
972.16s - 976.96s |  back on distance measuring equipment to ensure that if they were spoofed, they could correctly
976.96s - 980.96s |  approach the airport. But we started to see these issues affecting real flights.
982.72s - 986.64s |  But where I really want to move on to is the concept of time. We think too much, to my mind,
986.64s - 993.76s |  about GPS being a source of position, but it's actually a source of time. We're starting to see
993.84s - 1000.24s |  reports of the clocks on board airplanes during spoofing events start to do weird things.
1001.36s - 1005.44s |  Initially, we were starting to see very minor errors, so maybe it would jump forward a minute
1005.44s - 1010.88s |  or so, maybe even go back. And in that situation, pilots were advised, it's part of their quick
1010.88s - 1015.60s |  reference handbook, to switch back to the local clock on the airplane rather than rely on the
1015.60s - 1024.56s |  GPS one that was doing weird things. This is an incident I was party to. The GPS time did
1024.56s - 1030.32s |  something really weird. It rolled forward a very large amount, not something that's been widely
1030.32s - 1034.96s |  seen. Because it happened quickly, the pilots weren't able to switch the local time and it
1034.96s - 1039.12s |  caused a series of follow-up incidents. And you start to realise how important time is to an
1039.12s - 1047.12s |  airplane. It started to cause the digital certificates used for electronic communication
1047.12s - 1051.92s |  to become invalid. They weren't expired like we'd expect a certificate, they just weren't valid
1051.92s - 1055.68s |  because the time was too far in the future. One of the first effects, and you'll probably see this
1055.68s - 1059.60s |  as a passenger Wi-Fi might fail. Why? Because its digital certificates aren't valid anymore.
1060.24s - 1065.92s |  You then start to see issues around the controller to pilot data link communication,
1065.92s - 1072.56s |  which requires an accurate source of time. That's now not working, so you're now back to VHF.
1073.60s - 1078.08s |  Now in this particular incident, the flight landed safely. Pilots asked for radar vectors
1078.88s - 1083.36s |  and they landed fine. We expected them to land fine, that was not an issue.
1084.40s - 1088.96s |  But you see time being a really important component of other parts of the airplane
1088.96s - 1093.60s |  communications too. So TCAS, the Collision Avoidance Service, that's what stops airplanes
1093.60s - 1100.48s |  flying into each other. Great, we like that. The latest versions of TCAS allow for even
1102.32s - 1106.72s |  less spacing, so we can use airspace more efficiently, but it's still super safe
1106.72s - 1112.08s |  because we have GPS as precise sources of time. So we're starting to see TCAS causing issues.
1112.08s - 1117.84s |  Even something as simple as logging of incidents on an airplane. What do we need when we're creating
1117.84s - 1123.52s |  logs? An accurate source of time. So what is the authoritative source of time on board?
1123.52s - 1130.30s |  Well what's the most accurate source of time? GPS. What was really interesting about this incident
1130.30s - 1136.94s |  was that the time can actually be quite hard to re-establish. Now I've seen varying reports,
1136.94s - 1142.14s |  I've seen time go forward, I've heard about time going back as well. But in this particular
1142.14s - 1148.30s |  incident, there are protections in place to stop the time being rolled back. Why would time go back?
1148.46s - 1154.22s |  We wouldn't do that, would we? But actually we're not quite sure whether this is just this airplane,
1155.34s - 1159.26s |  the type of airplane, or even the manufacturer. We're not sure. There needs to be a lot more
1159.26s - 1166.94s |  work done here. But they couldn't roll the time back. There were protections in place to stop
1166.94s - 1172.70s |  the time that they'd go forward, but not back. And as a result, the airplane, most of the components
1172.70s - 1177.50s |  on it, had to be reflashed, which was a hugely expensive and time-consuming maintenance problem
1177.58s - 1184.70s |  issue. Cost directly, but most importantly, downtime on the airplane. It was down for a
1184.70s - 1189.02s |  significant period of time whilst everything was reflashed and time was brought back to normal.
1190.14s - 1196.14s |  Planes are very connected. Planes do lots of connectivity. Even something as simple as a data
1196.14s - 1203.82s |  loader requires a source of time. The SATCOMs require a source of time. Connectivity and safety
1203.82s - 1208.94s |  aboard airplanes needs the time to be right. So what do I take from this? Well,
1209.74s - 1215.90s |  it's pretty straightforward to spoof GPS. It's not that complicated. It doesn't require much
1215.90s - 1222.62s |  power. GPS is a very weak signal. A few watts will do it. It seems to be specific to some planes,
1223.58s - 1228.46s |  but I think more research is needed. And also I think as engineers become more familiar with the
1228.46s - 1234.54s |  process, I think we'll see maintenance, for instance like this, become much less disruptive,
1234.54s - 1242.62s |  which I think is great. What is the future? Well, hybrid. Using GPS, but correlating it with
1242.62s - 1247.98s |  systems on the ground that we know about. There are already sources of information on the ground.
1247.98s - 1253.50s |  We've got existing nav aids on the ground that we can cross-check with to make sure that the
1253.50s - 1259.42s |  GPS position we're receiving, the GPS time we're receiving is correct. But we need to think
1259.42s - 1265.98s |  carefully about retiring all those existing steam-powered navigation aids that are on the
1265.98s - 1270.94s |  ground. Because if we get too excited about it, we're not going to have anything to be hybrid against.
1272.62s - 1279.10s |  Scary. Let's just put aviation aside for a moment. It's not just aviation that uses GPS.
1279.58s - 1283.50s |  Financial services need a really accurate source of time for high-frequency trading.
1283.50s - 1288.14s |  A lot of industrial control systems use GPS. There are lots of other areas where GPS is used as a
1288.14s - 1293.02s |  trusted source of time. And spoofing in financial services, I'm not quite sure how that would work,
1293.82s - 1297.26s |  because you've got a stationary target rather than something up there. But it does get you
1297.26s - 1301.82s |  thinking, doesn't it? It does let you realise how important time is. Now, there's some further
1301.82s - 1307.66s |  watching. I really want you to watch one of my colleagues in the aerospace village give a talk
1307.66s - 1312.22s |  a bit later on. He's talking about the world of PKI in airplanes. Really, really interesting and
1312.22s - 1315.34s |  very relevant to what we've been talking about today. It's going to be in Crater Stage 2 at
1315.34s - 1319.10s |  half past five down the way there. But that's me. I hope you found it interesting. I'd be
1319.10s - 1322.06s |  glad to take some questions if you want to come to the front. Thank you.
