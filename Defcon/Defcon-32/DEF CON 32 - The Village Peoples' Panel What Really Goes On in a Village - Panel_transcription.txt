 Okay. So I'll start the panel since it's 10 o'clock
2.57s - 3.97s |  and I'm really on time with stuff.
3.97s - 7.61s |  So Honi. Honi is our Village Coordinator.
7.61s - 8.13s |  Good morning.
8.13s - 10.29s |  Good morning. Hi. Good morning.
10.29s - 14.37s |  Honi is our Defcon Village Lead Coordinator.
14.37s - 15.61s |  So is Pedro.
15.61s - 17.13s |  So is Reyes in the back
17.13s - 19.85s |  tweeting because e-mails just came through.
19.85s - 22.05s |  Do you want full names or what are we doing?
22.05s - 25.41s |  So Tom, ICS Village Lead.
25.41s - 27.41s |  Justin, Car Hacking Village.
27.41s - 29.15s |  Nina, Biohacking Village.
29.35s - 32.07s |  Muteki, Blue Team Village.
32.07s - 33.63s |  Do you want your real name?
33.63s - 35.23s |  Cassandra from Red Team Village.
35.23s - 36.23s |  That's me. It's my real name.
36.23s - 37.75s |  Oh, I'm sorry. Savannah.
37.75s - 39.11s |  This is my life now.
39.11s - 41.27s |  Savannah, Red Team Village.
41.27s - 42.27s |  Do you want your real name?
42.27s - 43.19s |  Yes.
43.19s - 45.35s |  Matt, Aerospace.
45.35s - 47.31s |  Now, Honi, what questions do you have for us
47.31s - 49.11s |  or do we self-moderate?
49.11s - 51.71s |  Go for it. Why do we do what we do?
51.71s - 53.07s |  What is the point of the villages?
53.07s - 56.07s |  Or actually we should do, what do the villages do?
56.07s - 57.15s |  What's the mission vision?
57.15s - 58.67s |  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
58.67s - 60.27s |  I can start.
60.27s - 63.55s |  I have a really adorable little story that I want to tell.
63.55s - 67.27s |  So Blue Team Village has been around for about seven years.
67.27s - 69.11s |  This is our seventh year.
69.11s - 71.47s |  We started, you know, a ragtag bunch of different people
71.47s - 73.23s |  who decided to throw a village together
73.23s - 75.15s |  and had no idea what the hell they were doing,
75.15s - 77.31s |  which is how DEF CON works in general, right?
77.31s - 78.87s |  It's a thing.
78.87s - 80.83s |  So we've been around for a few years.
80.83s - 83.59s |  Over the pandemic, you know, we had to go virtual for DC28.
83.59s - 87.15s |  And around that time, we started a mentoring program.
87.23s - 89.31s |  So met a lot of different people from all over the world,
89.31s - 93.35s |  got to do some remote events, you know, talks, things like that.
93.35s - 97.19s |  So this year, one of our first speakers
97.19s - 101.03s |  was actually someone who I had met who was from India
101.03s - 104.39s |  and then kind of like progressed in their career
104.39s - 106.03s |  with some help in the mentoring program.
106.03s - 109.31s |  And he actually gave a talk at Blue Team Village,
109.31s - 110.75s |  did a really awesome job.
110.75s - 112.75s |  And I got to give an intro, which was really cool.
112.75s - 115.39s |  But what really stuck out to me is like, you know,
115.83s - 119.55s |  the villages are communities in themselves.
119.55s - 121.75s |  They're organizations within DEF CON
121.75s - 123.99s |  that really help bring people together
123.99s - 126.43s |  based on common interests.
126.43s - 128.19s |  And being able to provide that space
128.19s - 129.79s |  for someone to like learn and grow,
129.79s - 131.03s |  to network within the community,
131.03s - 134.31s |  and then be able to progress their career to speak
134.31s - 137.67s |  is just like, I get a little like crazy, you know,
137.67s - 139.15s |  sometimes planning all this stuff
139.15s - 140.35s |  and then watching it come together.
140.35s - 142.59s |  And then I'm like, why am I doing this?
142.63s - 144.83s |  And then like, I get to see someone
144.83s - 146.71s |  who has grown because of what we do.
146.71s - 149.11s |  And that's like the fucking coolest thing.
149.11s - 150.63s |  So that's why I do this.
152.11s - 154.67s |  I can add to that because I 100% agree with you.
154.67s - 156.55s |  This is my fifth year running Car Wrecking Village.
156.55s - 159.23s |  Car Wrecking Village has been around for 10 years.
159.23s - 160.75s |  One of the biggest things I really encourage
160.75s - 161.91s |  is trying to get younger people
161.91s - 164.07s |  or newer people into this industry.
164.07s - 165.51s |  Over the last three years,
165.51s - 167.27s |  I've brought new people that weren't even
167.27s - 168.27s |  security people at all.
168.27s - 170.55s |  They were just tech people that are interested.
170.55s - 173.23s |  Some of them from ages 17 to 20.
173.23s - 177.15s |  And now two of them have jobs in security
177.15s - 178.47s |  and come here every year
178.47s - 179.87s |  and are part of helping the village.
179.87s - 181.75s |  So similar to her,
181.75s - 182.87s |  that's the reason why I do this
182.87s - 184.23s |  is to grow the communities
184.23s - 186.03s |  and to grow the next versions of the, you know,
186.03s - 187.43s |  us and people who can ensure
187.43s - 189.83s |  that the world's gonna be secure in the future.
189.83s - 192.27s |  I really care about cyber physical systems
192.27s - 195.51s |  as probably most of us up here on this panel do.
195.51s - 196.79s |  So that's why I do what I do.
196.79s - 198.63s |  I've also worked some in aerospace,
198.63s - 200.43s |  but I just wanna make sure the vehicles
201.31s - 202.15s |  and stuff you guys are getting into
202.15s - 203.27s |  are somewhat safe
203.27s - 206.51s |  and trying to make the people up top care a little bit.
206.51s - 207.63s |  It's kind of hard sometimes,
207.63s - 211.19s |  but yeah, I do it for the people.
214.75s - 215.79s |  Yeah, I guess I have to agree
215.79s - 216.83s |  with what they were saying too.
216.83s - 219.39s |  I think whenever there's a lot of like new students
219.39s - 221.11s |  or people in general that come to DEF CON
221.11s - 223.27s |  and they want to learn the specific niches.
223.27s - 225.51s |  So like all of us are obviously in specific niches
225.51s - 227.63s |  in these cybersecurity space.
227.63s - 229.15s |  And for example, like we had,
229.15s - 230.43s |  I have a friend,
230.43s - 231.43s |  it's like a family friend of a friend,
231.43s - 232.51s |  but he had come to DEF CON
232.51s - 234.59s |  and had never been to anything like this.
234.59s - 236.55s |  And he already had spoken to someone on Friday,
236.55s - 239.27s |  offering them an internship like within the village
239.27s - 240.87s |  and like being able to provide that space
240.87s - 242.83s |  where people can network and meet people
242.83s - 245.43s |  is I would say anything in any industry,
245.43s - 246.27s |  especially in ours,
246.27s - 247.79s |  networking is so important,
247.79s - 249.03s |  but then also giving a space
249.03s - 250.11s |  to be able to have people grow
250.11s - 252.47s |  like their offensive security skills.
252.47s - 254.47s |  And then also kind of take that over to other villages
254.47s - 258.14s |  to learn other areas too.
258.14s - 260.10s |  Okay, so I guess mine's a little bit different
260.18s - 263.50s |  because I'll start off with,
263.50s - 266.26s |  I'm a pilot and there's a joke in there
266.26s - 268.70s |  where like, how do you know you're at a party with pilot?
268.70s - 269.62s |  They'll tell you.
269.62s - 272.78s |  So that's how I start all my talks.
272.78s - 276.70s |  But the qualifier there is when I get in airplanes,
276.70s - 278.58s |  when I'm flying them,
278.58s - 282.30s |  I want to be comfortable with the risks
282.30s - 284.38s |  that are inherent with just flying any airplane
284.38s - 286.26s |  and not anybody on the ground
286.26s - 287.86s |  or anybody in the back of the airplane
287.86s - 290.10s |  doing anything that they shouldn't be.
290.10s - 291.90s |  And so I want to make sure
291.90s - 295.14s |  the people on board my airplane are safe.
295.14s - 296.78s |  But one of the things that we find
296.78s - 301.42s |  in the Aerospace Village is while mentoring is fantastic,
301.42s - 305.38s |  we are just struggling to get the companies to show up,
305.38s - 306.54s |  the manufacturers,
306.54s - 309.66s |  the people that build the systems in the airplanes,
309.66s - 311.42s |  everybody's got their silos,
311.42s - 314.70s |  everybody wants to keep everything to be black boxes.
314.70s - 319.06s |  And so we are really trying to get the manufacturers
319.06s - 322.02s |  and all of those other companies involved
322.02s - 324.34s |  and talking about the systems
324.34s - 325.54s |  that they have on board the airplane
325.54s - 328.34s |  because it is fascinating.
328.34s - 330.98s |  I mean, I can easily be flying an airplane,
330.98s - 333.50s |  a commercial airplane that is 20 years old
333.50s - 335.82s |  and I can guarantee you 20 years ago,
335.82s - 337.22s |  they were not built
337.22s - 339.18s |  with any sort of cybersecurity standards.
339.18s - 342.14s |  So how are you bolting that on in today's world?
342.14s - 344.10s |  It needs to be talked about.
344.42s - 345.62s |  So that's what's driving me.
345.62s - 347.82s |  It's sort of a selfish interest
347.82s - 351.06s |  of getting more attention paid to this space.
351.06s - 352.10s |  I mean, I hate flying.
352.10s - 353.86s |  So like I completely support that.
355.46s - 358.30s |  Everyone, my name is Tom Van Norman with ICS Village.
358.30s - 361.54s |  We started ICS Village here 11 years ago.
361.54s - 362.38s |  Time flies.
363.98s - 365.74s |  So we are a registered nonprofit.
365.74s - 367.90s |  We go many conferences throughout the year.
367.90s - 370.06s |  We have sponsors, we have grants,
370.06s - 371.22s |  we have all that fun stuff.
371.22s - 373.46s |  But we started it 11 years ago,
373.86s - 374.70s |  and it was just a bunch of people
374.70s - 378.82s |  that answered a call for villages, I think it was,
378.82s - 380.90s |  and applied for it and went.
381.78s - 385.34s |  The reason I got into it was because back then,
385.34s - 387.30s |  not so much now, but a little bit now,
387.30s - 388.50s |  we'd have people up on the stage,
388.50s - 392.58s |  whether it's DEF CON or in a magazine or whatever,
392.58s - 394.98s |  talking about hacking that PLC,
394.98s - 397.50s |  hacking this thing, and they're full of shit.
397.50s - 400.98s |  It didn't, they're just wrong on what they're saying.
400.98s - 405.38s |  So I come from control systems, engineering, technician,
405.38s - 408.18s |  all that stuff out in the field doing things.
408.18s - 410.42s |  And when we see people up on stage saying,
410.42s - 414.38s |  oh, we can do this thing with that thing,
414.38s - 416.26s |  all right, maybe, but it doesn't matter.
416.26s - 418.10s |  It really does not matter.
418.10s - 421.30s |  So instead of countering that person saying,
421.30s - 424.46s |  hey, you really don't know, let's educate, let's uplift,
424.46s - 426.82s |  let's go and spread, instead of spreading FUD,
426.82s - 430.30s |  let's go and show people what you can do, what matters,
430.30s - 431.86s |  because not everything matters, right?
431.86s - 435.14s |  You can put, we can secure your control system
435.14s - 438.50s |  80% pretty easy, the other 10% is hard,
438.50s - 440.74s |  and the other 10% is extremely hard.
440.74s - 443.06s |  So let's educate, let's make it awareness,
443.06s - 447.26s |  let's do things for the community, the people's things.
447.26s - 449.14s |  In a long way, let's bring new blood in.
449.14s - 450.02s |  We're all getting old.
450.02s - 452.10s |  We're all gonna retire here, right?
452.10s - 458.68s |  And let's bring new people in.
458.68s - 460.24s |  I forgot what I was gonna say.
461.80s - 463.44s |  Just wanted to say a couple of things.
463.44s - 464.76s |  Yeah, sorry, I'll say a couple of things.
464.76s - 468.80s |  So Pedro and I, where you are, the village leads, right?
468.80s - 472.24s |  And then Ray's, we brought him on this year to just do,
472.24s - 474.16s |  I think it's just an outstanding job
474.16s - 475.76s |  setting up these creator stages.
476.96s - 479.36s |  Main focus for this right here is we wanted to
479.36s - 482.04s |  kind of like uplift a lot of the content
482.04s - 485.00s |  that all the villages are bringing to DEF CON
485.00s - 487.52s |  and give it recorded space.
489.20s - 490.84s |  I know it's outside of the village spaces,
490.84s - 493.36s |  so it's not as conducive as what some of you guys
493.36s - 494.64s |  want all the time.
494.64s - 498.44s |  But we really wanted to like sort of start upbranding
498.44s - 499.92s |  a lot of the content that you're bringing.
499.92s - 502.84s |  And that way we can have both the village sponsors,
502.84s - 506.72s |  our village brand into it as well on top of that as DEF CONs.
508.36s - 510.68s |  The main thing though that like Pedro and I see
510.68s - 512.76s |  for ourselves is we're kind of the middlemen
512.76s - 515.00s |  between DEF CON and the villages.
515.00s - 517.44s |  Villages come to us and they have these crazy ideas
517.44s - 518.68s |  of things that they're gonna bring this year
518.68s - 519.92s |  and we have to figure out, okay,
519.92s - 522.84s |  how do we scope and tailor this with DEF CON
522.84s - 525.00s |  to make sure that they can bring what they wanna bring?
525.00s - 527.28s |  Namely, Nina brought some really, really cool stuff
527.28s - 528.44s |  this year.
528.44s - 530.72s |  One's like a giant robot.
530.72s - 531.76s |  I can talk about that.
531.76s - 532.60s |  Okay, I'm sorry.
533.92s - 536.36s |  But all those things basically they come with a cost
536.36s - 537.68s |  in the sense of like square footage,
537.68s - 539.32s |  which we have a finite amount for.
539.32s - 542.76s |  So like for us, it is playing the middleman
542.76s - 545.92s |  between DEF CON and the village leads
545.92s - 547.72s |  and making sure that we can support them
547.72s - 549.44s |  as best as we possibly can.
549.96s - 552.32s |  And also at the same time, sometimes the requests of like,
552.32s - 553.68s |  hey, we need 20,000 square feet.
553.68s - 555.84s |  We're like, do you really though?
555.84s - 558.40s |  We maybe tailor that down a little bit.
558.40s - 563.20s |  But I think Pedro and I, like we see the villages
563.20s - 566.56s |  as some of the premier content at DEF CON.
566.56s - 569.92s |  The value that they bring is outstanding.
569.92s - 573.72s |  A lot of the pen testing that occurs here is world-class.
573.72s - 575.44s |  The value, the return on investment,
575.44s - 577.20s |  a lot of the sponsors have when they come
577.20s - 581.24s |  and they bring their devices, their vehicles,
581.24s - 584.84s |  parts of their planes, the whole nine yards to DEF CON.
584.84s - 587.28s |  And the amount of research CVEs
587.28s - 591.00s |  that are produced by these villages is outstanding.
591.00s - 593.44s |  And in one weekend in comparison to like,
593.44s - 596.12s |  if you were to quantify that on the amount of pen tests
596.12s - 597.40s |  and the amount of money they'd have to spend
597.40s - 600.76s |  in the normal market, it's insane.
600.76s - 603.84s |  So, I mean, Pedro and I are huge fans obviously,
603.84s - 606.24s |  cause we stick around and keep doing this for some reason,
606.32s - 608.12s |  but we also wanted to say thank you.
609.48s - 612.56s |  So, Biohacking Village has been around for 10 years.
612.56s - 613.96s |  I've run it for nine.
613.96s - 617.68s |  My first year of being with the Biohacking Village,
617.68s - 620.64s |  every single time on that pamphlet that they give you
620.64s - 621.48s |  was completely wrong.
621.48s - 624.00s |  So I sat in the room and at some point they were like,
624.00s - 625.56s |  you keep sitting here, what's wrong with you?
625.56s - 626.76s |  And I was like, I wanna be part of this,
626.76s - 628.04s |  let's hook up, let's do this.
628.04s - 629.48s |  So anyway, I've run it for nine years.
629.48s - 631.76s |  We have five different labs, the device lab,
631.76s - 633.28s |  which is all the manufacturers,
633.28s - 635.04s |  the medical device manufacturers bring their wares,
635.04s - 638.16s |  hardware, software, firmware, embedded, whatever.
638.16s - 640.20s |  And they put that in front of the table
640.20s - 643.48s |  and they ask the hacker community to break their shit.
643.48s - 644.84s |  It is not hyperbole.
644.84s - 646.20s |  Over the last 16 hours,
646.20s - 648.00s |  there have been 42 vulnerabilities found
648.00s - 652.36s |  from 10 medical device manufacturers, 25 devices.
652.36s - 654.08s |  These are devices, most of these devices
654.08s - 656.48s |  are things that currently live in hospitals.
656.48s - 661.16s |  So in that room is $3.5 billion worth of medical devices
661.16s - 664.36s |  and about $4 trillion worth of brainpower and IP.
664.40s - 668.44s |  We also have a capture the flag, tabletop exercises, talks,
668.44s - 671.28s |  and something else that I never remember, workshops.
671.28s - 672.40s |  That's what we do.
672.40s - 676.12s |  So all of this takes 360 days to put together,
676.12s - 678.72s |  two days to load in and three days for a conference.
678.72s - 680.88s |  We've already started talking about the badge for next year
680.88s - 683.12s |  because this is very consuming.
683.12s - 685.32s |  And I agree with a lot of the things that you said
685.32s - 686.88s |  about how DEF CON is trying to help us
686.88s - 688.36s |  and work through this.
688.36s - 690.88s |  Biohacking Village has three times more space
690.88s - 693.00s |  than we had last year, which is why this year
693.00s - 694.68s |  we could bring a surgical robot.
694.68s - 698.84s |  So the pincers are as big as like the ends of two needles
698.84s - 701.32s |  trying to get tiny microscopic things
701.32s - 702.68s |  out of people's bodies.
702.68s - 703.72s |  That's what we have over there.
703.72s - 704.60s |  If you have an opportunity,
704.60s - 705.96s |  you should definitely play with it
705.96s - 709.16s |  because this surgical robot lives in the hospitals.
710.20s - 715.00s |  Our sponsors are the million dollar, billion dollar people.
715.00s - 718.00s |  I am really harsh with people
718.00s - 720.92s |  about how they need to be here and show up.
720.92s - 722.76s |  The Biohacking Village has a partnership
723.52s - 725.40s |  with the FDA where it's called We Heart Hackers
725.40s - 728.16s |  that the manufacturers can write on their submissions
728.16s - 729.56s |  that they were hacked at DEF CON.
729.56s - 730.60s |  This is a big deal to them.
730.60s - 734.12s |  They understand the reasons behind it.
734.12s - 736.72s |  The other part is the Biohacking Village is a CNA.
736.72s - 738.56s |  So if something is found and they can't report it,
738.56s - 740.28s |  the manufacturers can't report it themselves,
740.28s - 742.56s |  we will happily report it for them.
743.44s - 744.68s |  There was something else that I was gonna say
744.68s - 745.60s |  that was probably important.
745.60s - 746.76s |  Oh, why do I do this?
746.76s - 749.32s |  I am really fucking overwhelmed and tired
749.32s - 751.12s |  of patients going into hospitals
751.12s - 753.56s |  and being in a world of hurt
753.56s - 755.52s |  and then the hospital doesn't work.
755.52s - 757.56s |  So they may have to have their surgeries redone
757.56s - 759.60s |  or they don't understand what's happening to them
759.60s - 761.64s |  and nobody is able to explain it.
761.64s - 762.76s |  Nobody should go to the hospital,
762.76s - 765.08s |  get put attached to a machine and go,
765.08s - 765.92s |  what is this?
765.92s - 766.76s |  What am I doing here?
766.76s - 768.24s |  And nobody has a real answer.
768.24s - 770.12s |  When the blue screen of death recently happened
770.12s - 771.36s |  because of CrowdStrike,
771.36s - 773.00s |  I wasn't working in the hospital,
773.00s - 774.40s |  I was working in the hospital.
774.40s - 778.16s |  And I was blown away by the nurses and the staff
778.16s - 779.80s |  that were like, we gotta go back to paper
779.80s - 781.20s |  and I don't even know what the sheet says.
781.20s - 782.56s |  I don't know how to do this.
782.56s - 785.20s |  So for me, this is one of those things
785.20s - 787.40s |  that like sits in my soul about we gotta fix this.
787.40s - 790.44s |  This is enough, we gotta do it.
790.44s - 791.40s |  I appreciate that
791.40s - 793.96s |  because I had malpractice as a kid in surgery
793.96s - 796.36s |  and I do not trust doctors or any hospitals or any of that.
796.36s - 798.60s |  So thank you for doing that.
798.60s - 799.88s |  I wanna add to that a little bit.
799.88s - 801.32s |  So I talked a lot about,
801.32s - 802.84s |  or I talked about like,
802.84s - 803.80s |  for me the personal thing,
803.80s - 804.64s |  like the mentoring
804.64s - 807.36s |  and kind of bringing new people into the field.
807.36s - 809.64s |  One thing I love about being part of the Blue Team Village
810.48s - 811.88s |  is like we cover all of these areas.
811.88s - 814.68s |  Like the people that come to learn about IR,
814.68s - 818.00s |  threat hunting, CTI and things like that
818.00s - 821.92s |  span every single field on this table.
821.92s - 823.44s |  Like, you know,
823.44s - 826.28s |  these are the people that are going out to do defense
826.28s - 828.88s |  when there's a cyber attack against a hospital
828.88s - 832.24s |  or, you know, an airline company or whatever.
832.24s - 833.48s |  Apparently it's really hard to hack planes,
833.48s - 835.56s |  which is definitely good.
835.56s - 838.24s |  Makes me feel better as someone who hates flying.
838.28s - 841.24s |  You know, and then that's just to be like,
841.24s - 843.72s |  seeing all of these pieces come together
843.72s - 846.24s |  is really, really cool.
846.24s - 848.12s |  And I've learned a lot from it.
848.12s - 849.20s |  Yeah, just love it.
851.08s - 852.92s |  Got any more questions for us, Honey?
854.04s - 855.76s |  Can we ask Honey questions?
855.76s - 857.44s |  Maybe we could talk about.
860.21s - 861.05s |  Sure.
867.61s - 868.85s |  So Nina, why don't you,
868.85s - 871.81s |  you talked about how you,
871.81s - 875.05s |  you're able to have the companies actually like say,
875.05s - 877.25s |  hey, we were hacked at DEF CON.
877.25s - 880.81s |  How are you able to frame that in a positive light?
880.81s - 883.53s |  Because we've tried,
884.61s - 888.45s |  so a lot of the aircraft and associated systems
888.45s - 889.69s |  are certified.
889.69s - 892.41s |  And so if anything happens to them,
892.41s - 893.97s |  they are no longer certified.
893.97s - 897.29s |  And so there's a very much a line between,
897.29s - 899.21s |  hey, us tinkering with things
899.21s - 901.53s |  and what actually goes on an airplane.
902.21s - 905.13s |  How are you able to get these manufacturers to say,
905.13s - 907.73s |  hey, we want to do this.
907.73s - 909.81s |  We want to brag about how we brought it to DEF CON.
909.81s - 912.21s |  Because on our end, on the aviation side,
912.21s - 913.61s |  people are nervous about saying,
913.61s - 915.29s |  I brought my airplane.
915.29s - 917.29s |  I brought my systems to DEF CON.
917.29s - 919.01s |  We're slowly making progress, but yeah.
919.01s - 919.85s |  How have you done that?
919.85s - 921.89s |  It's a lot of aggressive hope and prayer.
923.01s - 925.61s |  So my background is I've worked in hospitals for 20 years
925.61s - 927.29s |  and being in the hospital.
927.29s - 928.93s |  So I worked on the electronic medical record
928.93s - 929.77s |  and then the APIs
929.85s - 931.97s |  and putting all of the devices into the EMR.
931.97s - 934.05s |  So all of the information would sync
934.05s - 935.93s |  and just watching how all of it happened.
935.93s - 937.41s |  I was super annoyed.
938.85s - 943.85s |  The moment is that one of the FDA humans
944.17s - 946.73s |  is the medical device manufacturer.
946.73s - 947.77s |  That's bullshit.
947.77s - 950.25s |  The medical device cybersecurity director
950.25s - 952.17s |  for CDRH at the FDA.
952.17s - 955.01s |  She used to work for one of the medical device manufacturers
955.01s - 956.61s |  and now she runs the thing at the FDA.
956.61s - 959.81s |  And she is super invested in ensuring patient safety.
959.81s - 961.21s |  We're all patients at the end of the day.
961.21s - 962.45s |  Whether you go to the doctor or not,
962.45s - 963.45s |  you have an EMR somewhere.
963.45s - 966.57s |  You have an MRN, medical record number, somewhere.
966.57s - 969.17s |  So we are all affected by this no matter what happens.
969.17s - 972.29s |  When they come up and they're like, this isn't for me.
972.29s - 973.49s |  I'm not okay with this.
973.49s - 976.89s |  I'm like, sure, but I'm aggressive.
976.89s - 978.69s |  I think we all know that at this point.
979.69s - 982.57s |  I will go up to them and tell them their revenue.
982.57s - 984.49s |  Your revenue cycles will be affected by this.
984.49s - 986.97s |  The ROI of them coming to DEF CON
986.97s - 989.85s |  and bringing their devices here will say, you did this.
989.85s - 992.61s |  You trusted this community to do the hard thing for you.
992.61s - 994.69s |  What they do here is worth,
994.69s - 997.01s |  but the vulnerabilities and the pentest here
997.01s - 1001.57s |  are worth about 350 to like $750,000
1001.57s - 1004.33s |  that they're getting for like nothing to do this.
1004.33s - 1007.89s |  So they can come here, get all of their shit tested,
1007.89s - 1010.05s |  hardcore, go home and fix it.
1010.05s - 1011.01s |  No big deal.
1011.01s - 1013.25s |  They can report it or just say it's a finding
1013.25s - 1014.45s |  and go fix it.
1015.45s - 1018.05s |  So great.
1018.05s - 1019.93s |  If I have to get involved,
1019.93s - 1022.97s |  that is a very different level of annoyance for them.
1022.97s - 1025.09s |  They have vulnerability disclosure programs
1025.09s - 1026.33s |  that I'm like everything.
1026.33s - 1027.17s |  That's a great question.
1027.17s - 1028.65s |  So the device lives here.
1029.93s - 1031.81s |  Oh, sorry.
1031.81s - 1033.05s |  So I was just asking like,
1033.05s - 1035.17s |  how does she ensure that these vulnerabilities
1035.17s - 1037.01s |  that they're finding actually get fixed?
1037.01s - 1038.37s |  So it's cool to find all this stuff,
1038.37s - 1040.21s |  but a lot of times you can't guarantee they get fixed.
1040.21s - 1042.17s |  So just curious on how you track and monitor
1042.21s - 1044.97s |  and ensure these vulnerabilities are getting fixed.
1044.97s - 1048.61s |  So every day I send an email back to everybody
1048.61s - 1051.05s |  stating this is the number of vulnerabilities we have.
1051.05s - 1052.21s |  I talk to the hackers around,
1052.21s - 1053.69s |  I talk to the manufacturers and I collate,
1053.69s - 1055.29s |  make sure everything is correct.
1056.25s - 1058.97s |  They have their own vulnerability disclosure programs
1058.97s - 1061.65s |  that everything is supposed to be sent to immediately.
1061.65s - 1064.17s |  If they have to go through me as not just me,
1064.17s - 1066.37s |  but through the biohacking village as a CNA,
1066.37s - 1067.81s |  that becomes a CISA issue
1067.81s - 1069.37s |  that they don't want to get involved with.
1069.41s - 1072.29s |  So they're pretty good at fixing their things.
1072.29s - 1073.33s |  You have some legislation on your side.
1073.33s - 1075.05s |  We do have legislation on our side.
1075.05s - 1075.89s |  That's nice.
1079.85s - 1081.37s |  I think that's why you're making more progress
1081.37s - 1082.57s |  than most of us.
1082.57s - 1084.09s |  Yeah, I guess.
1084.09s - 1086.93s |  So somebody at work told me I was wrong about a piece of law
1086.93s - 1089.09s |  and I was like, I'm not wrong about what this is.
1089.09s - 1092.53s |  And I started law school, so nobody likes me right now
1092.53s - 1095.61s |  because I'm like, it's not what that says.
1095.61s - 1098.85s |  So Nina, I have to say,
1099.41s - 1100.37s |  I had to disagree.
1101.61s - 1105.09s |  I had to disagree with most of this stuff here.
1106.41s - 1108.01s |  Well, first you can talk about hospitals.
1108.01s - 1108.93s |  We all need healthcare.
1108.93s - 1111.09s |  Either we need it today, tomorrow, whatever.
1111.09s - 1113.09s |  We all need healthcare.
1113.09s - 1115.41s |  If we don't have the ICS stuff, guess what doesn't work?
1115.41s - 1117.53s |  Your robot, your other stuff, right?
1119.13s - 1123.41s |  So where I disagree with a lot of people here,
1123.41s - 1124.97s |  I think coming here and finding vulnerabilities
1124.97s - 1126.45s |  is a horrible idea.
1126.45s - 1128.09s |  From a business, I'm a business owner,
1128.13s - 1129.65s |  is a horrible idea.
1129.65s - 1130.49s |  Why?
1130.49s - 1131.33s |  I don't know who you are.
1131.33s - 1132.17s |  I don't know who you are.
1132.17s - 1133.01s |  I don't know who you are.
1133.01s - 1134.97s |  Now I leave here saying my device is secure
1134.97s - 1138.05s |  because X, Y, and Z found vulnerabilities.
1138.05s - 1140.77s |  Completely bad idea, horrible idea.
1140.77s - 1144.29s |  Where if I go and if I pay ABC company,
1145.29s - 1146.85s |  they still might not find the vulnerabilities,
1146.85s - 1148.85s |  but now I have somebody to hold accountable.
1148.85s - 1150.61s |  Now I have somebody to go back and say,
1150.61s - 1153.25s |  hey, you know what guys, you gave me a report
1153.25s - 1156.17s |  and this low hanging fruit thing was not found.
1156.17s - 1158.81s |  Where I come to any conference and find a vulnerability
1158.81s - 1160.09s |  and I leave with that good feeling that,
1160.09s - 1161.29s |  hey, we found, what'd you say?
1161.29s - 1162.93s |  How many vulnerabilities?
1162.93s - 1165.13s |  42, 42.
1165.13s - 1166.61s |  Interesting.
1166.61s - 1167.45s |  Really interesting.
1167.45s - 1169.37s |  Do they have a testing model?
1169.37s - 1170.21s |  Yeah.
1170.21s - 1171.85s |  Didn't seem like it.
1171.85s - 1173.93s |  Those are tested before they get here.
1173.93s - 1175.45s |  But so if they're tested before they get here,
1175.45s - 1176.65s |  how do they find 42?
1177.77s - 1179.97s |  Do you wanna go to them just to accept these copies?
1179.97s - 1180.81s |  Is that what we're here for?
1180.81s - 1182.53s |  Okay, we're leading, it's a leading question.
1182.53s - 1184.89s |  Okay, I'm gonna interrupt
1185.21s - 1186.53s |  and throw something else out there.
1186.53s - 1188.33s |  So I think you can tell by this point
1188.33s - 1190.17s |  that we're all really passionate about what we do
1190.17s - 1192.13s |  and we've all been doing it for a very long time,
1192.13s - 1193.93s |  which brings up a really good point.
1193.93s - 1195.89s |  So villages are separate organizations.
1195.89s - 1197.81s |  We have very few people
1197.81s - 1199.89s |  that have been invested for a long time.
1199.89s - 1201.77s |  All of us, I think pretty much,
1201.77s - 1204.13s |  we start planning pretty much right after DEF CON.
1204.13s - 1206.85s |  We have a hot wash, we kind of review lessons,
1206.85s - 1209.09s |  you go through lessons, learn, make some changes.
1209.09s - 1212.85s |  At the end of the day, it's usually a few people
1212.85s - 1214.37s |  at the very top of the organization
1214.85s - 1217.09s |  that define what the village does.
1217.09s - 1220.13s |  And one of the issues that I think we have with that
1220.13s - 1221.41s |  is people get burnt out.
1222.49s - 1224.45s |  I don't know how Nina is functioning right now.
1224.45s - 1226.21s |  I don't know how I'm functioning right now.
1226.21s - 1228.13s |  I went to a metal festival in Germany
1228.13s - 1229.97s |  and then flew in from Germany on Tuesday
1229.97s - 1230.81s |  and hit the ground running
1230.81s - 1233.49s |  because we had unload set up Wednesday,
1233.49s - 1235.33s |  12 hours in the village on Thursday.
1235.33s - 1237.25s |  I didn't eat until like 9 p.m.
1237.25s - 1238.61s |  I never made it to merch.
1238.61s - 1241.77s |  I have like one 4XL, which is what I got.
1241.77s - 1244.49s |  So I think it's like, this kind of passion is great,
1244.49s - 1245.93s |  but like, I don't know.
1245.93s - 1247.45s |  I guess maybe my question to other panelists is
1247.45s - 1251.29s |  how do you work on getting other people involved?
1251.29s - 1254.17s |  And because none of us are paid for this either.
1254.17s - 1255.01s |  At least I'm not.
1255.01s - 1255.85s |  I don't know.
1255.85s - 1256.69s |  Are you getting paid?
1256.69s - 1257.53s |  Yeah, no.
1257.53s - 1258.37s |  This is all volunteer work.
1258.37s - 1259.41s |  We have full-time jobs.
1259.41s - 1262.25s |  So how do each of your villages handle
1262.25s - 1264.25s |  like getting people involved
1264.25s - 1267.41s |  so that you don't have to be completely run into the ground?
1268.33s - 1269.45s |  Yeah, that's a really good question.
1269.45s - 1271.69s |  So I'll start from the Car Hacking Village side.
1272.89s - 1274.61s |  We go to a lot of different events as well.
1274.61s - 1276.77s |  So we don't just go to DEF CON.
1276.77s - 1278.65s |  We do Black Hat Middle East.
1278.65s - 1280.89s |  We do a lot of different global events as well.
1280.89s - 1283.33s |  So we try to get as much recognition as possible.
1283.33s - 1285.57s |  And through that, typically we find a lot of people
1285.57s - 1287.13s |  that have no clue what any of this stuff is
1287.13s - 1288.65s |  or how to get into car hacking.
1288.65s - 1291.29s |  So I usually like to try to bring them as volunteers
1291.29s - 1292.61s |  because a lot of those people are pretty driven
1292.61s - 1294.05s |  to want to learn and grow.
1294.05s - 1295.77s |  And I don't mind if you don't know anything,
1295.77s - 1296.77s |  we can teach you that.
1296.77s - 1298.61s |  As long as you have motivation and drive,
1298.73s - 1302.49s |  then we will welcome you in and bring you to help volunteer.
1302.49s - 1303.81s |  So that's kind of been my philosophy.
1303.81s - 1305.81s |  As long as I can find someone that's driven and motivated,
1305.81s - 1308.25s |  I can teach them the ropes and bring them in.
1308.25s - 1309.89s |  And usually that's helped us a lot.
1309.89s - 1312.97s |  So a lot of our volunteers within the last two years
1312.97s - 1316.37s |  have been younger kids from graduating right out of college,
1316.37s - 1318.41s |  some that are even younger than that,
1318.41s - 1320.53s |  that are just really eager and seeing the stuff in the news
1320.53s - 1322.41s |  about cars getting hacked and hearing about these things
1322.41s - 1323.97s |  and just wanting to be involved.
1323.97s - 1326.85s |  And then they send us an email
1326.85s - 1328.49s |  or they see us at a conference and we're just like,
1328.49s - 1330.33s |  hey, you seem pretty motivated and driven.
1330.33s - 1332.89s |  Here's my contact information, stay in contact with me
1332.89s - 1334.81s |  and we'd love to have you volunteer.
1334.81s - 1336.05s |  It's worked really well for us,
1336.05s - 1337.77s |  but it is kind of more ad hoc.
1337.77s - 1338.81s |  So it is difficult,
1338.81s - 1341.85s |  but we've tried to do call for volunteers in the past
1341.85s - 1343.25s |  and it gets a little bit chaotic
1343.25s - 1345.77s |  because what you'll learn is you get a bunch of people
1345.77s - 1347.01s |  that just want to get a badge
1347.01s - 1348.77s |  and they just want to get access to the event.
1348.77s - 1350.09s |  And that's the most difficult thing to do
1350.09s - 1352.17s |  is how do we find people that are gonna be dedicated
1352.17s - 1354.01s |  and stay in the village and not wander off
1354.01s - 1355.21s |  and go do other things
1355.21s - 1357.93s |  because we want to ensure we put on a show for you guys.
1357.93s - 1359.33s |  We want to make sure you guys can actually come
1359.33s - 1361.37s |  and hack a car or come and hack a medical device
1361.37s - 1363.93s |  or rip apart an airplane or whatever it might be.
1363.93s - 1366.57s |  So yeah, it's definitely a difficult thing to do.
1366.57s - 1368.41s |  Call for volunteers is hard.
1368.41s - 1370.45s |  I recommend trying to go to more events,
1370.45s - 1372.61s |  but then that exhausts us all.
1373.61s - 1375.89s |  On the exhaustion piece, if nobody's seen me yesterday,
1375.89s - 1378.13s |  I had an IV in my arm, I don't even drink.
1378.13s - 1379.65s |  I was just so dead and exhausted
1379.65s - 1381.17s |  and didn't eat or dehydrated.
1381.17s - 1383.69s |  So yeah, we're all very stubborn, dedicated people
1383.69s - 1384.77s |  and we love what we do
1384.77s - 1387.85s |  and we're just gonna keep doing it until we can't.
1388.85s - 1393.85s |  So we take a similar model to Car Hacking Village.
1394.57s - 1396.21s |  We don't do call for volunteers.
1396.21s - 1398.61s |  We just get inundated with people
1398.61s - 1401.53s |  that hit us up on LinkedIn, Twitter, whatever,
1401.53s - 1402.81s |  say, hey, we want to do something.
1402.81s - 1404.89s |  Great, come here, talk to us.
1404.89s - 1405.97s |  And they don't show.
1405.97s - 1407.73s |  And it takes a lot of recycles.
1409.61s - 1410.49s |  We have a Justin here that,
1410.49s - 1413.57s |  hey, when you have a person that comes up and says,
1413.57s - 1415.57s |  I really want to help out here.
1415.57s - 1416.41s |  Fantastic.
1417.05s - 1418.13s |  Now you approached me.
1418.13s - 1419.49s |  Now you volunteered.
1419.49s - 1421.01s |  Now let's go do this.
1421.01s - 1422.01s |  It may or may not work out,
1422.01s - 1423.93s |  but tell you what, we have people,
1423.93s - 1424.89s |  I'll be doing this 11 years.
1424.89s - 1426.97s |  We still have people from 10, 11 years ago
1426.97s - 1428.09s |  that come around.
1429.49s - 1430.49s |  Hey, how can I help?
1430.49s - 1432.81s |  They're not involved anymore officially,
1432.81s - 1434.13s |  but how can we help?
1434.13s - 1434.97s |  What can we do?
1434.97s - 1436.05s |  Do you need that stuff moved, set up?
1436.05s - 1437.65s |  And we do that.
1437.65s - 1442.65s |  The one thing that we struggled with a long time is money.
1443.29s - 1444.13s |  Right?
1444.13s - 1448.69s |  So Defcon, very, very thankful we get the badges we get,
1448.69s - 1449.53s |  but you know what?
1449.53s - 1453.29s |  It's going to cost us almost 40,000 bucks to be here.
1453.29s - 1455.57s |  Y'all got $40,000, right?
1455.57s - 1456.41s |  Real money.
1456.41s - 1458.25s |  This is real money that is coming out of our-
1458.25s - 1459.09s |  It's 70.
1461.85s - 1463.61s |  The budgets are wild.
1463.61s - 1466.65s |  So the one thing that we do now
1466.65s - 1468.89s |  is we find sponsors, companies,
1468.89s - 1471.85s |  people that want to be involved that pay their own way.
1473.21s - 1474.05s |  I'm sorry.
1474.05s - 1475.77s |  INL has escape rooms down there.
1475.77s - 1476.61s |  Great.
1476.61s - 1477.45s |  Bring that stuff.
1477.45s - 1478.27s |  You're paying your own way.
1478.27s - 1480.65s |  You're a lab, you're a corporation, whatever.
1480.65s - 1483.65s |  That 30, 40,000 bucks is just for the village volunteers
1483.65s - 1486.21s |  to come here, travel, shipping, stuff like that.
1486.21s - 1490.33s |  Our shipping today will be probably three, 4,000 bucks
1490.33s - 1491.17s |  going on.
1491.17s - 1492.01s |  I don't know what it was coming in.
1492.01s - 1492.85s |  We didn't get the bill yet,
1492.85s - 1495.25s |  but it's real money.
1495.25s - 1496.09s |  Real money.
1496.09s - 1497.89s |  And it used to come out of our own pockets.
1497.89s - 1501.69s |  Now we get sponsors and stuff to do this,
1501.69s - 1504.77s |  but I saw you got a tractor trailer down there.
1504.77s - 1506.01s |  I bet you that was expensive.
1506.01s - 1508.61s |  Even if they donated it, there's still a cost there.
1508.61s - 1510.05s |  There's hours of coordination.
1510.05s - 1511.73s |  There's time, there's effort.
1511.73s - 1513.69s |  And you probably have a real job, right?
1513.69s - 1514.53s |  Oh yeah.
1514.53s - 1515.37s |  Yeah.
1515.37s - 1517.57s |  And Nina, you work too, don't you?
1517.57s - 1518.57s |  I think so.
1518.57s - 1519.57s |  Yeah, all right.
1519.57s - 1524.29s |  So we have probably thousands of hours
1524.29s - 1526.09s |  between all of us leading up to this event
1526.09s - 1529.53s |  starting next week for next year.
1529.53s - 1530.77s |  And hopefully you invite us back next year
1530.81s - 1531.81s |  because if not, we're gonna be really pissed
1531.81s - 1533.25s |  if we start planning for next year
1533.25s - 1534.53s |  and you don't invite us.
1536.37s - 1539.93s |  But yeah, anybody wants to get involved,
1539.93s - 1541.17s |  I'd highly recommend getting involved.
1541.17s - 1543.89s |  A couple of years ago, we brought in the maritime.
1543.89s - 1545.73s |  So wave.
1545.73s - 1546.69s |  I see you guys back there.
1546.69s - 1547.53s |  There you go.
1550.41s - 1552.61s |  Maritime folks join ICSY
1552.61s - 1555.21s |  because it's a floating control system, isn't it?
1556.13s - 1558.93s |  So we have a lot of really, really, really cool stuff there,
1558.93s - 1560.93s |  but we can't come here without people saying,
1560.93s - 1562.81s |  hey, I wanted to do that, this or that,
1562.81s - 1564.61s |  and I wanna help, I wanna volunteer.
1564.61s - 1565.81s |  And it could be raising money.
1565.81s - 1567.37s |  It could be maintaining a website.
1567.37s - 1571.49s |  It could be moving those boxes from A to B.
1571.49s - 1576.29s |  So come down, talk, and we'll get you involved.
1577.85s - 1578.97s |  I just wanna reframe real quick.
1578.97s - 1583.53s |  How many of you are, this is your first DEF CON.
1583.53s - 1586.21s |  How many of you have gone to all the villages
1586.21s - 1587.61s |  or seen all the villages?
1587.61s - 1589.53s |  There's a lot of villages.
1589.57s - 1591.69s |  I just wanted to see, okay.
1591.69s - 1592.53s |  Oh, I was just gonna say,
1592.53s - 1593.53s |  like agreeing with Justin too,
1593.53s - 1595.89s |  with like actually going up at an event,
1595.89s - 1597.29s |  I think some of the best volunteers
1597.29s - 1599.41s |  that we kind of get out of DEF CON
1599.41s - 1601.01s |  are the ones that either one,
1601.01s - 1602.41s |  they never even sign up for a call for volunteer.
1602.41s - 1603.77s |  They just offer to help.
1603.77s - 1606.09s |  And they're the one who ends up staying like the entire time
1606.09s - 1608.29s |  and they end up being like a long-term volunteer.
1608.29s - 1610.57s |  And it's so helpful to help like delegate out tasks
1610.57s - 1612.61s |  with like the crowd control and whatnot.
1612.61s - 1615.69s |  And then also like people that just have been with us
1615.69s - 1617.49s |  from the beginning or like they're on a shift
1617.49s - 1620.01s |  and then they notice people aren't showing up to volunteer
1620.01s - 1621.13s |  and then they end up sticking around.
1621.13s - 1622.37s |  Like, it's so helpful to us
1622.37s - 1623.69s |  to be able to put the village together
1623.69s - 1626.53s |  because I think people don't realize how stressful it is.
1626.53s - 1627.65s |  Like all of us leading up,
1627.65s - 1629.65s |  like everyone probably wants to kill each other,
1629.65s - 1633.13s |  like leading up to DEF CON, but we all love each other.
1633.13s - 1634.37s |  Yeah.
1634.37s - 1636.49s |  I think going kind of off of what Tom was talking about
1636.49s - 1638.61s |  with the logistics of getting things here
1638.61s - 1640.73s |  and doing, you know, bringing a tractor here.
1640.73s - 1642.61s |  So we've been trying to do this tractor trailer
1642.61s - 1644.73s |  or this tractor for the last three years.
1644.73s - 1648.61s |  It's last year they pulled out two weeks before.
1648.61s - 1651.29s |  So we had everything planned, we had everything ready to go.
1651.29s - 1652.69s |  We worked with them, you know,
1652.69s - 1655.21s |  we figured out we can get the vehicle in and everything.
1655.21s - 1658.21s |  And the company was like, nope, cold feet and left.
1658.21s - 1660.37s |  So we have to really quickly in two weeks figure out,
1660.37s - 1661.73s |  okay, how do we bring another vehicle in?
1661.73s - 1662.57s |  How do we do all this?
1662.57s - 1664.25s |  So there's a lot of complexity
1664.25s - 1666.29s |  and logistics that go on behind the scenes
1666.29s - 1668.77s |  to ensure that there's actually a tractor here.
1668.77s - 1670.57s |  So this year we're really happy to have one.
1670.57s - 1671.53s |  And the company that brought it
1671.53s - 1674.21s |  actually gave us their diagnostics laptop as well.
1674.21s - 1676.33s |  And they said, have fun with it, do whatever you want.
1676.33s - 1678.25s |  We're shredding it in a machine when it's done.
1678.25s - 1680.53s |  So you guys can have fun.
1680.53s - 1682.73s |  So it's really cool to see the progress
1682.73s - 1683.93s |  that's happened over the years
1683.93s - 1686.49s |  and the fact that now these companies are this open
1686.49s - 1687.97s |  and willing to work with us
1687.97s - 1690.09s |  and actually willing to give us their diagnostics laptop.
1690.09s - 1691.69s |  I think that's wild, but yeah,
1691.69s - 1694.69s |  it's a lot of logistics going on behind the scenes.
1694.69s - 1698.13s |  That makes me really glad that at BTV we have swag.
1698.13s - 1701.85s |  Like that's our shipping, nothing crazy, just swag.
1701.85s - 1704.45s |  We had a semi-truck, a Rivian, and a Tesla.
1704.45s - 1709.45s |  So the Rivian was driven here, the semi-truck, it was SIA.
1709.73s - 1712.81s |  So if anybody knows S-A-I-A, they're all over the US.
1712.81s - 1715.57s |  So it wasn't really hard for them to pick a truck out
1715.57s - 1719.69s |  and get it here, but yeah, it's a lot of logistics going on.
1719.69s - 1721.05s |  So I think one of the common law things
1721.05s - 1722.01s |  that we all do with each other
1722.01s - 1723.45s |  is we have chat groups with each other.
1723.45s - 1725.57s |  And when something happens, it's, did you see this?
1725.57s - 1726.41s |  How's it affecting you?
1726.41s - 1727.33s |  How's it affecting me?
1727.33s - 1729.61s |  How do we do the things?
1729.61s - 1732.81s |  And so I'm like you now, I lost my train of thought.
1732.81s - 1735.01s |  That always results in Nina calling us.
1735.01s - 1737.69s |  I do call a lot of people.
1737.69s - 1739.65s |  Hody's up here like, it's really weird
1739.65s - 1741.57s |  that all the villages are now asking the same question
1741.57s - 1742.81s |  at the same time.
1742.81s - 1744.77s |  I know their call has occurred as soon as I start,
1744.77s - 1746.81s |  we all, you know, Pedro and I start getting hit up
1746.81s - 1750.05s |  by all of you at the same time with the exact same question.
1750.05s - 1751.57s |  I don't know why they keep doing this.
1751.57s - 1753.97s |  We're still ganged up on like all the time.
1753.97s - 1754.85s |  We actually do like them.
1754.85s - 1755.69s |  They're great people.
1755.69s - 1756.57s |  Thank you for what you do.
1756.57s - 1758.61s |  Another interesting perspective I'll help you guys
1758.61s - 1760.81s |  understand and don't kick me for this one,
1760.81s - 1762.49s |  but Defcon pays us nothing.
1762.49s - 1764.05s |  They give us nothing.
1764.05s - 1766.13s |  All they did this year, which was really awesome.
1766.13s - 1767.29s |  They gave us hotel rooms.
1767.29s - 1768.69s |  I really appreciated that.
1768.69s - 1770.85s |  And that was something new that they did.
1770.85s - 1773.05s |  So it's nice to see that Pedro and Hody
1773.05s - 1774.89s |  are actually trying to take care of us more.
1774.89s - 1776.45s |  In previous years, it's kind of been like,
1776.45s - 1777.89s |  hey, call for villages.
1777.89s - 1778.81s |  Cool, do your own thing.
1778.81s - 1780.09s |  Come on in.
1780.09s - 1782.33s |  So it's nice to see that Defcon as an organization
1782.33s - 1784.77s |  is actually caring about what we're bringing
1784.77s - 1787.41s |  and what we're doing and trying to bring some value back
1787.45s - 1789.01s |  to us to help with what we're doing.
1789.01s - 1790.53s |  So sorry about that.
1790.53s - 1791.37s |  No, you're good.
1791.37s - 1792.29s |  He just whispered to me to be nice.
1792.29s - 1793.49s |  I am gonna be nice.
1793.49s - 1794.33s |  Let me.
1796.61s - 1799.61s |  So I think a good thing,
1799.61s - 1801.77s |  and it's not in a perfect state yet, right?
1802.65s - 1804.57s |  Well, I will say on the sponsorship side,
1804.57s - 1808.41s |  Pedro and I, we started getting a little bit more recognition
1808.41s - 1809.73s |  in some of the other places that we go.
1809.73s - 1811.09s |  People are coming up to us.
1811.09s - 1812.89s |  Our networks are saying, hey, Pedro and Hody,
1812.89s - 1814.73s |  they're the village leads.
1814.73s - 1816.45s |  We've had a couple sponsors walk up to us
1816.45s - 1818.21s |  or people from different companies saying,
1818.21s - 1819.89s |  hey, we would like to sponsor a village.
1819.89s - 1822.85s |  So we've tried to marry some of that stuff up.
1822.85s - 1825.25s |  I will say that I think a couple of them worked out
1825.25s - 1826.13s |  and a few of them didn't,
1826.13s - 1827.49s |  but we're always trying to do that.
1827.49s - 1830.49s |  I know Kevin from Defcon is definitely trying to do that.
1830.49s - 1832.33s |  I think this is a little bit of a weird year
1832.33s - 1835.37s |  with the Audible moving from Caesars to LVCC.
1835.37s - 1837.21s |  I think that there was a little bit of gun shyness
1837.21s - 1838.05s |  on some of those sides.
1838.05s - 1840.69s |  So I think that we can definitely do a much better job
1840.69s - 1841.65s |  for you guys.
1841.65s - 1844.69s |  I'm hoping after this year that we get back on track
1844.69s - 1845.53s |  with some of it.
1846.73s - 1848.29s |  He mentioned the hotel rooms.
1848.29s - 1853.29s |  So there is basically a fund that comes in through,
1854.97s - 1856.93s |  I don't know if I'm allowed to say it.
1856.93s - 1858.33s |  We get a fund basically.
1860.61s - 1862.25s |  We get a fund of money, right?
1862.25s - 1865.49s |  And it's decided on how it's easiest to divvy it out.
1865.49s - 1867.17s |  Previously, we had done some stuff with them
1867.17s - 1870.01s |  where we were able to supply them funds for food
1870.01s - 1870.85s |  during the con,
1870.85s - 1872.25s |  because that's, I know, a major pain point for them
1872.25s - 1874.21s |  because they're stuck inside of a village.
1874.21s - 1876.65s |  Food is 10 miles away
1876.65s - 1878.73s |  because we're stuck inside of a convention center
1878.73s - 1880.01s |  and you're not allowed to bring outside food
1880.01s - 1881.53s |  and drink inside.
1881.53s - 1885.23s |  So that was a pain point we tried to help alleviate.
1886.77s - 1888.73s |  This year, I thought we were doing it again,
1888.73s - 1889.57s |  but I was told not.
1889.57s - 1891.49s |  So we got hotel rooms for you guys.
1891.49s - 1894.57s |  And once again, Pedro and I are pushing
1894.57s - 1897.73s |  for better execution on a lot of these things.
1897.73s - 1900.85s |  We had everything set up and we had a different timeline
1900.85s - 1903.53s |  than what we were given at the end of the day.
1903.53s - 1906.89s |  So we're always pushing and trying to drive
1906.89s - 1910.57s |  towards getting you guys as much information as possible.
1910.57s - 1913.13s |  That way, it's easier for you to plan and execute on things.
1913.13s - 1914.29s |  That way, you're also not spending money
1914.29s - 1916.25s |  on something that we're gonna hopefully provide to you
1916.25s - 1917.49s |  type deal as well.
1918.73s - 1919.57s |  But yeah.
1920.45s - 1921.89s |  I had a question for everybody here.
1921.89s - 1922.73s |  Can I go real quick?
1922.73s - 1924.29s |  Yeah.
1924.29s - 1925.13s |  Great.
1926.33s - 1930.97s |  So this is a point of admiration for real.
1931.93s - 1933.25s |  I've done this for 10 years, right?
1934.13s - 1936.41s |  I think two years ago when you took over, was it two?
1936.41s - 1937.25s |  Pedro and I took over.
1937.25s - 1938.09s |  Yeah.
1938.09s - 1940.61s |  I had so many long discussions with them
1940.61s - 1945.61s |  because I am really, village building is my passion.
1945.93s - 1949.09s |  So, so many conversations with both of them to be like,
1949.09s - 1952.25s |  this is how we as a group like to do the things.
1952.25s - 1954.05s |  This is how we need timelines.
1954.05s - 1956.49s |  We need help doing this, whatever, whatever, whatever.
1956.49s - 1958.01s |  And they actually listened,
1958.01s - 1962.81s |  which from the large Defcon Corporation moment perspective,
1962.85s - 1963.77s |  super helpful.
1963.77s - 1966.49s |  So for me, at least this year, it was,
1967.57s - 1970.05s |  honestly, this is the best year for the biohacking village.
1970.05s - 1971.13s |  I hardly had to do anything
1971.13s - 1973.69s |  because it was so well executed.
1973.69s - 1976.13s |  So that's good for you.
1976.13s - 1976.97s |  I would agree.
1976.97s - 1978.97s |  Even with changing facilities and buildings
1978.97s - 1980.21s |  and all that chaos that happened,
1980.21s - 1981.89s |  you guys still smoothed it out
1981.89s - 1983.01s |  and made it pretty easy for us.
1983.01s - 1985.17s |  So yeah, big kudos to you guys for that.
1985.17s - 1988.01s |  I'll have you guys know that like in January, February,
1988.01s - 1991.37s |  Pedro and I had everything laid out, mapped out,
1991.37s - 1993.49s |  every process, every system.
1993.49s - 1995.97s |  And then, you know, we get a phone call of, hey, stop.
1995.97s - 1996.81s |  And-
1996.81s - 1998.13s |  Right, that's a good point
1998.13s - 2001.85s |  because all of us were planning for whatever it was.
2001.85s - 2003.81s |  All of us were planning for other hotels
2003.81s - 2004.93s |  and we were super invested
2004.93s - 2006.89s |  because we knew the blueprints, we were there.
2006.89s - 2009.65s |  And then suddenly it was like, fuck you, Defcon changed.
2009.65s - 2011.09s |  It's like, oh God, what to wear?
2011.09s - 2012.49s |  What are we doing now?
2012.49s - 2013.33s |  And then it was-
2013.33s - 2014.85s |  Our messaging was softer than that,
2014.85s - 2015.85s |  just so you're aware.
2017.37s - 2019.49s |  And it was all of us going, well, where are we gonna be?
2019.49s - 2020.33s |  What are we gonna do?
2020.33s - 2021.17s |  How are we shipping?
2021.81s - 2022.65s |  What's the cost?
2022.65s - 2023.49s |  What are we doing?
2023.49s - 2024.33s |  I know this is recorded.
2024.33s - 2026.49s |  I curse a lot, everybody knows.
2026.49s - 2029.49s |  So it was, I think you softened it, yes.
2029.49s - 2030.93s |  And I think the transition to this year
2030.93s - 2033.65s |  was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
2033.65s - 2035.33s |  I honestly felt so bad for both of you.
2035.33s - 2036.65s |  When I saw that, I was like, oh my God,
2036.65s - 2037.49s |  they're gonna be slammed.
2037.49s - 2039.85s |  So we were, Blue Team Village is pretty organized.
2039.85s - 2041.01s |  I mean, like, I like to joke
2041.01s - 2042.17s |  that we're the most organized village
2042.17s - 2044.61s |  because Blue Teamers are the people that have jobs
2044.61s - 2046.25s |  and, you know, are professionals.
2046.25s - 2047.57s |  I don't have a job.
2047.65s - 2049.25s |  I don't have a job.
2050.69s - 2052.09s |  Them's fighting words, yeah.
2054.73s - 2056.37s |  Tell that to my employer, please.
2057.89s - 2059.13s |  So I do have a question.
2059.13s - 2059.97s |  No, no, I'm not done yet.
2059.97s - 2060.81s |  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
2060.81s - 2062.17s |  You're gonna give me a job?
2063.33s - 2064.25s |  You can interview with me.
2064.25s - 2065.09s |  We'll see how it goes.
2065.09s - 2065.93s |  It'll be fine.
2066.97s - 2070.81s |  But I think, wait, I was going somewhere with that one.
2070.81s - 2073.89s |  I think you made me, it was my turn to pause.
2073.89s - 2075.57s |  I think what I was really getting at was like,
2075.57s - 2077.05s |  you know, we're really organized
2077.57s - 2080.01s |  and we kind of have this consistent, like,
2080.01s - 2081.81s |  way that we do things and whatnot.
2081.81s - 2083.25s |  So I was trying, we were trying to do
2083.25s - 2084.65s |  as much as possible by ourselves
2084.65s - 2085.61s |  and answer our own questions
2085.61s - 2087.37s |  and not, like, rely on Honey and Pedro so much
2087.37s - 2089.57s |  because we knew that they were getting inundated with stuff.
2089.57s - 2091.73s |  So I'm gonna jump on the train of, like,
2091.73s - 2092.73s |  you guys are doing a great job.
2092.73s - 2095.53s |  So can we actually give Honey and Pedro a round of applause?
2095.53s - 2098.96s |  Yeah.
2100.96s - 2104.52s |  Pedro's coming up here.
2104.52s - 2105.48s |  Pedro.
2105.48s - 2108.60s |  I've been waiting all day to say, no, I'm just kidding.
2108.60s - 2111.12s |  I just want to say that I picked up a few nuggets
2111.84s - 2112.68s |  here and there, and I would just like to start off
2112.68s - 2116.20s |  by saying that Honey and I are also not paid by DEF CON.
2116.20s - 2118.32s |  We are stipend volunteers.
2118.32s - 2119.60s |  So just keep that in mind
2119.60s - 2123.92s |  when everybody's asking for meetings nonstop.
2123.92s - 2126.12s |  We also have families and lives and work
2126.12s - 2127.16s |  and et cetera, right?
2127.16s - 2129.48s |  I have two dogs that I love dearly.
2129.48s - 2131.12s |  My children think that I love my dogs
2131.12s - 2132.48s |  more than I love them.
2132.48s - 2133.88s |  And sometimes they're right.
2134.88s - 2136.44s |  My dogs never talk back.
2137.76s - 2140.40s |  Regarding volunteers, a lot of first timers
2140.40s - 2142.16s |  always ask, how can I get involved?
2143.28s - 2146.80s |  I'd just like to shout out to one of the new
2146.80s - 2147.96s |  to be goons next year.
2147.96s - 2149.44s |  His name is Irf.
2149.44s - 2151.20s |  He showed up early.
2151.20s - 2152.28s |  I think it was Tuesday.
2152.28s - 2153.84s |  He was like, hey, I'm here.
2153.84s - 2154.84s |  Do you guys need anything?
2154.84s - 2157.48s |  Helped us just like with loading in, counting badges.
2157.48s - 2160.12s |  We had already counted badges at least five times.
2160.12s - 2162.36s |  And since he was fresh blood, I was like, okay,
2162.36s - 2163.88s |  do me a favor, open these boxes
2163.88s - 2165.28s |  and start counting them one by one.
2165.28s - 2168.20s |  We're talking about 930 plus badges.
2169.16s - 2171.48s |  Then he was like, hey, if we're done here,
2171.48s - 2172.44s |  I'm gonna go check out
2172.44s - 2174.00s |  and see if any of the villages need help.
2174.00s - 2174.96s |  So next thing I know,
2174.96s - 2177.80s |  he's down at Packet Hacking Village running cable.
2177.80s - 2180.00s |  That was Tuesday, Wednesday.
2180.00s - 2181.52s |  Thursday, he came back to help us.
2181.52s - 2182.56s |  And then he was like, okay, cool.
2182.56s - 2183.88s |  I'm going back to Packet Hacking.
2183.88s - 2187.60s |  So honestly, reaching out via LinkedIn
2187.60s - 2190.76s |  and trying to be like, hey, cool, let me in.
2190.76s - 2192.60s |  And then never showing up, that's gonna happen.
2192.60s - 2194.16s |  But if you really wanna get involved,
2194.16s - 2196.36s |  the easiest thing to do is just to show up
2196.36s - 2199.00s |  and just be like, I'm here, what do you need?
2199.00s - 2199.84s |  The other-
2199.84s - 2201.28s |  You said LinkedIn, LinkedIn's a big thing.
2201.28s - 2204.24s |  Oh, I mean, you can reach out to me on LinkedIn
2204.24s - 2205.68s |  if you can find me.
2205.68s - 2208.20s |  That's a contest, right?
2208.20s - 2209.52s |  The other thing I wanted to mention
2209.52s - 2213.72s |  is that I want to say that I picked up a small tidbit
2213.72s - 2215.56s |  over at Car Hacking.
2215.56s - 2219.12s |  I do vulnerability research in embedded systems.
2219.12s - 2221.20s |  And I picked up a small tidbit.
2221.20s - 2224.12s |  I'm contemplating buying a car
2224.12s - 2225.24s |  and I'm going for the jugular.
2225.24s - 2228.12s |  So on Nina's behalf,
2228.12s - 2229.72s |  I do think that these manufacturers
2229.72s - 2231.80s |  should be working with us
2231.80s - 2233.88s |  to try to find these vulnerabilities,
2233.88s - 2235.00s |  get them disclosed and patched
2235.00s - 2237.20s |  before it ends up in the public consumption.
2237.20s - 2239.08s |  And so reaching over to ICS,
2239.08s - 2241.12s |  like if you wanna live in the black box,
2241.12s - 2243.00s |  people like me are gonna find it.
2243.00s - 2245.12s |  I already know what's there.
2245.12s - 2246.24s |  I'm not gonna just put it out there
2246.24s - 2249.36s |  because I wanna be the first one to go after it.
2249.36s - 2252.04s |  So I'm kind of in between Tom and Nina, literally.
2252.96s - 2255.16s |  And one of the things we did this year,
2255.16s - 2256.56s |  I still have a question I wanna go back to
2256.56s - 2257.56s |  that kind of goes into volunteers,
2257.56s - 2260.20s |  but one of the things we actually were able to do this year
2260.20s - 2262.92s |  is get the auto ISAC out here to help.
2262.92s - 2265.24s |  So for those that don't know what an ISAC is,
2265.24s - 2268.04s |  it's an information sharing and analysis center.
2268.04s - 2269.04s |  They have one for automotive.
2269.04s - 2270.92s |  So this is the first year they came out and sponsored
2270.92s - 2273.00s |  and actually tried to be a part of DEF CON,
2273.00s - 2274.08s |  which normally they're not
2274.08s - 2276.08s |  because they're more on the blue team and monitoring side
2276.08s - 2277.52s |  and trying to fix things.
2277.52s - 2279.56s |  But this is one way we're trying to bridge the gaps
2279.56s - 2283.64s |  is bringing companies or organizations like that here
2283.64s - 2285.96s |  to help when we do find things or we do have issues,
2285.96s - 2287.92s |  they can at least work right away with the OEMs
2287.92s - 2289.88s |  and submit that to them.
2289.88s - 2290.92s |  Yeah, so I just wanted to say that,
2290.92s - 2291.84s |  but the question I had,
2291.84s - 2292.76s |  and I know we don't have much time
2292.76s - 2295.16s |  because I can see that clock back there.
2295.16s - 2297.40s |  How many volunteers do you guys all have
2297.40s - 2302.40s |  and how do you work with them regarding like times
2302.60s - 2304.68s |  and shifts and stuff like that?
2304.68s - 2307.68s |  I'll start on my side and then I'll let it go down.
2307.68s - 2310.00s |  So on our side, we have 35 volunteers
2310.00s - 2313.12s |  and then about 20 other sponsors and people that come in.
2313.12s - 2316.28s |  So I have about 60 to 70 people I deal with
2316.28s - 2317.12s |  throughout this event
2317.12s - 2319.16s |  that are always asking me for information.
2319.16s - 2321.24s |  How do they need this or need that?
2321.24s - 2323.08s |  And what time do they have to be at places?
2323.08s - 2324.80s |  So outside of the logistics of planning
2324.80s - 2325.84s |  and getting people here,
2325.84s - 2328.04s |  while we're here, it's just chaos.
2328.04s - 2331.20s |  Like I'm literally trying to manage 70 people right now
2331.20s - 2332.72s |  and it's insane because they're all like,
2332.72s - 2333.56s |  hey, where are we eating?
2333.56s - 2334.48s |  Where is this going on?
2334.48s - 2335.68s |  Where is that going on?
2335.68s - 2337.84s |  So it's very complex and difficult to do.
2337.84s - 2340.16s |  And I'm curious on how some of you guys handle that
2340.16s - 2341.84s |  because I could use some advice.
2344.67s - 2348.43s |  So we have about 70 volunteers, if not maybe 80.
2348.43s - 2351.51s |  We have two leads that lead that, Mike and Danielle.
2351.51s - 2353.31s |  And Mike actually like built out
2353.31s - 2355.67s |  this whole custom portal for us this year.
2355.67s - 2356.51s |  I think he was telling,
2356.51s - 2357.35s |  he was trying to tell other villages
2357.35s - 2359.63s |  that he'll like help y'all like get it too.
2359.63s - 2360.95s |  It's just something he like customly built
2360.95s - 2363.39s |  to be able to kind of like assign shifts
2363.39s - 2365.59s |  because we do, like we were mentioning earlier,
2365.59s - 2367.11s |  we don't always have volunteers show up.
2367.63s - 2369.39s |  So we always have to kind of like
2369.39s - 2370.51s |  reach out to others and whatnot,
2370.51s - 2372.99s |  but we do have those two people that are managing those.
2372.99s - 2374.75s |  And we do have around 70 people
2374.75s - 2376.55s |  that are volunteering throughout the con.
2376.55s - 2379.23s |  And it's a lot of names to keep track of as well.
2379.23s - 2380.11s |  And I'll let Matt.
2381.55s - 2384.07s |  Yeah, so we have internal volunteers
2384.07s - 2386.71s |  and then a lot of our activities,
2386.71s - 2390.39s |  the companies that bring their own activities,
2390.39s - 2392.63s |  they are sort of in charge of their own.
2392.63s - 2395.63s |  So if you're a Boeing, if you're a Lockheed
2396.03s - 2398.39s |  and you bring 10 people, it's up to you
2398.39s - 2401.43s |  how you wanna staff your activity.
2401.43s - 2406.23s |  For, or Embry-Riddle through the Aviation ISAC,
2406.23s - 2410.63s |  they brought 15 students and they also just, yeah.
2410.63s - 2412.67s |  So for their activity, they were,
2412.67s - 2414.47s |  we let them handle their own scheduling.
2414.47s - 2417.87s |  There's some activities where it's literally two people
2417.87s - 2422.27s |  and they are there every single hour for the entire con.
2422.27s - 2424.75s |  And internally, we have our own set of volunteers
2425.87s - 2429.19s |  about 20 or so people to help with workshops,
2429.19s - 2433.11s |  to help with just organizing everything.
2433.11s - 2435.19s |  And thankfully we have a volunteer coordinator
2435.19s - 2436.51s |  that takes care of all that.
2436.51s - 2437.83s |  And yeah, we've got,
2437.83s - 2439.59s |  we're trying some new software this year.
2439.59s - 2442.07s |  We'll see if that actually was a success or not.
2442.07s - 2444.63s |  I think so, just to try and get things organized
2444.63s - 2447.95s |  because all too often we're just shooting from the hip
2447.95s - 2449.83s |  and saying, okay, I've got a need
2449.83s - 2451.99s |  and who can do it right now?
2452.99s - 2456.07s |  Yeah, we have, we kind of split them up a little bit.
2456.07s - 2458.95s |  So we're a 501C3 nonprofit.
2458.95s - 2460.95s |  We have board of directors.
2462.03s - 2463.79s |  So this year it's basically myself
2463.79s - 2465.79s |  and two of the other directors,
2465.79s - 2467.55s |  shout out Crime Santa and Omenscan,
2468.51s - 2471.15s |  that are, we kind of start the initial planning
2471.15s - 2472.35s |  and then we kind of downstream
2472.35s - 2474.63s |  to consistent staff that we have.
2474.63s - 2476.51s |  So basically our leads.
2476.51s - 2478.23s |  So we have like Daniela and Satan
2478.23s - 2479.99s |  who manage all the volunteers.
2480.99s - 2483.75s |  We have Definga dealing with the CTF that we have.
2483.75s - 2485.19s |  We do our own CTF,
2486.79s - 2487.63s |  a whole bunch of other people
2487.63s - 2489.95s |  that are involved in kind of organizing things.
2489.95s - 2493.27s |  Cheerio handled all the workshops, things like that.
2493.27s - 2495.15s |  And then we have also some day volunteers
2495.15s - 2496.55s |  where we'll sign like doors
2496.55s - 2499.35s |  and kind of that crowd management info booth,
2499.35s - 2500.99s |  things like that.
2500.99s - 2503.35s |  I would say like staff wise.
2503.35s - 2505.07s |  So three directors staff wise,
2505.07s - 2507.79s |  maybe 10 to 15 that are involved
2507.79s - 2509.67s |  in the actual planning phase.
2510.35s - 2511.19s |  And then we wind up with anywhere
2511.19s - 2513.07s |  between like 30 and 70 volunteers,
2513.07s - 2514.43s |  depending on who shows up.
2515.87s - 2520.87s |  So yeah, the badge thing is always challenging.
2521.11s - 2523.67s |  Cause you know, we do get badges from DEF CON
2523.67s - 2525.47s |  that we try to give to the volunteers,
2525.47s - 2527.43s |  but we want to make sure that they go to the people
2527.43s - 2528.67s |  that show up year after year.
2528.67s - 2530.11s |  And that's always a challenge.
2530.11s - 2531.55s |  I knew the spice was coming.
2533.03s - 2534.43s |  Not even that spicy.
2534.43s - 2535.27s |  Yeah.
2535.27s - 2536.27s |  Well, since we're on that topic,
2536.27s - 2537.79s |  let's talk about badges.
2537.79s - 2542.79s |  So as village logistics advocates,
2543.11s - 2545.79s |  we have a finite pool of badges
2545.79s - 2549.19s |  that we can sprinkle across all the content creators.
2550.27s - 2551.59s |  We have secret shoppers.
2551.59s - 2552.71s |  I don't know if you know this,
2552.71s - 2555.23s |  but we have secret shoppers that are evaluating you.
2555.23s - 2557.03s |  You'll never pick them out.
2557.03s - 2558.07s |  And then we get feedback.
2558.07s - 2559.43s |  And based off of that feedback,
2559.43s - 2563.87s |  that's how we're also providing quantifiable,
2563.87s - 2565.67s |  you know, metrics to DEF CON
2565.67s - 2568.67s |  to try to advocate for more badges for villages.
2568.67s - 2572.75s |  So one of the things that constantly comes across to us
2572.75s - 2574.87s |  is how can I get more badges?
2574.87s - 2576.99s |  There's always going to be a limit, right?
2576.99s - 2579.31s |  Just because each village thinks
2579.31s - 2580.55s |  that they need the most badges
2580.55s - 2583.11s |  and each village thinks they need the most space,
2583.11s - 2586.19s |  but we only have so much to spread around.
2586.19s - 2589.47s |  So you will normally get questions from us
2589.47s - 2592.27s |  and we will usually ask for justifications.
2592.27s - 2594.83s |  Sometimes, you know, depending on the request,
2594.83s - 2596.47s |  we'll even go as far as like,
2596.47s - 2599.55s |  provide us a schedule of who's working for how long.
2601.95s - 2602.99s |  I'll comment on that.
2602.99s - 2603.91s |  Do you really want that?
2603.91s - 2605.35s |  Yeah, oh yeah, we're going there.
2605.35s - 2609.03s |  So we've been doing this for 11 years now
2609.03s - 2612.67s |  and we're going to be $30,000, $40,000 into this.
2612.67s - 2614.59s |  A lot of freaking money, right?
2614.59s - 2616.59s |  Not even counting the hardware or any,
2616.59s - 2618.55s |  and our sponsors will go and bring stuff
2618.55s - 2621.95s |  and we're not counting that money.
2621.95s - 2624.67s |  I don't think I've ever been asked by DEF CON
2625.51s - 2626.35s |  what we put into things,
2626.35s - 2627.55s |  how many thousands of hours
2627.55s - 2629.11s |  and how many tens of thousands
2629.11s - 2631.11s |  or hundreds of thousands of dollars.
2631.11s - 2633.95s |  We're asking for a badge that,
2633.95s - 2638.19s |  I don't know, what's this thing, $60, $70 for a badge?
2638.19s - 2639.99s |  No, no, no, no, no, that's retail.
2639.99s - 2641.51s |  What's the thing cost?
2641.51s - 2642.99s |  75 bucks.
2642.99s - 2647.23s |  So when we're putting in tens of thousands of dollars,
2647.23s - 2648.83s |  those questions never come back to us
2648.83s - 2650.67s |  and, hey, what did you put in?
2650.67s - 2654.07s |  But we're constantly fighting for poker chips for food
2654.11s - 2655.67s |  or a couple of hotel rooms.
2655.67s - 2657.23s |  Extremely, I think we're all extremely grateful
2657.23s - 2658.47s |  for everything.
2658.47s - 2661.35s |  It still seems one way on what we're doing here.
2661.35s - 2663.95s |  So, you know, we got 40 badges.
2663.95s - 2666.35s |  We bought 20 and so we have 60 badges.
2666.35s - 2670.23s |  Put $15,000 into the pot here for the other badges.
2670.23s - 2671.71s |  All right, 10 minutes.
2671.71s - 2674.63s |  The, sell us these things at cost.
2674.63s - 2675.99s |  These things aren't 500 bucks.
2675.99s - 2677.63s |  They're $75.
2677.63s - 2678.63s |  Sell them to us at cost
2678.63s - 2681.31s |  because we are down in that village nonstop.
2685.00s - 2689.00s |  I'll give you the CEO response type style
2689.00s - 2692.00s |  because I don't want to get myself into trouble.
2692.00s - 2695.24s |  I will say that everything you see at DEF CON costs money.
2695.24s - 2696.76s |  Oh, yeah, 100%.
2696.76s - 2697.60s |  Everything in your village,
2697.60s - 2700.48s |  you pay nothing to be in the village.
2700.48s - 2703.00s |  The space, the floor, the real estate,
2703.00s - 2706.00s |  all the requests that you have, DEF CON is paying for that.
2706.00s - 2707.16s |  Not going to go into how much that is
2707.16s - 2709.56s |  because even I personally don't know how much that is
2709.56s - 2711.60s |  because we're not privy to that knowledge, right?
2711.72s - 2714.56s |  But I know that DEF CON does invest a lot of money
2714.56s - 2716.20s |  for the real estate, for the space,
2716.20s - 2717.84s |  and for a lot of the logistics that go into it.
2717.84s - 2720.96s |  I'm not taking away from anything that the villages do
2720.96s - 2721.80s |  as far as that goes,
2721.80s - 2724.76s |  because I understand Nina and a few of the other leads
2724.76s - 2725.84s |  have kind of expressed to me like,
2725.84s - 2727.20s |  hey, this is what we're investing in this.
2727.20s - 2730.80s |  And trust me, Pedro and I are cognizant of it.
2730.80s - 2732.52s |  And that's why we're trying to push for more sponsorship
2732.52s - 2734.12s |  and everything else like that for you.
2736.04s - 2738.72s |  From DEF CON's perspective,
2738.72s - 2742.20s |  the badge does mean something more than just the 70 bucks.
2742.20s - 2745.44s |  That is access to the con itself.
2745.44s - 2747.88s |  And so there is a drastic difference between,
2747.88s - 2751.28s |  hey, I have 50 volunteers who are coming
2751.28s - 2752.48s |  and they're working the entire time.
2752.48s - 2754.12s |  Like, okay, that's easier justification.
2754.12s - 2755.76s |  Or I have somebody who's gonna come
2755.76s - 2758.64s |  teach a 30 minute workshop, I want a badge.
2758.64s - 2760.32s |  There's a drastic difference between the two of those.
2760.32s - 2763.28s |  So like, I'm not saying you, I'm not saying you.
2763.28s - 2766.20s |  But there are some instances where we are trying
2766.20s - 2767.24s |  to kind of clean that up,
2767.24s - 2770.12s |  because one, it's not fair to ICS Village
2770.12s - 2773.00s |  if we're giving 80 badges to somebody
2773.00s - 2774.20s |  and that's what they're doing.
2774.20s - 2776.16s |  And you're sitting at 50, right?
2776.16s - 2777.52s |  Or some of those lines, right?
2777.52s - 2778.36s |  Someone got 80 badges.
2778.36s - 2781.08s |  We wanna make sure it's equitable across the, shh.
2781.08s - 2782.32s |  We wanna make sure it's,
2782.32s - 2784.40s |  these are all fake numbers, it's okay.
2784.40s - 2785.76s |  We wanna make sure that it's equitable
2785.76s - 2786.88s |  across the board, right?
2786.88s - 2790.96s |  And that the support that we're giving out is appropriate.
2791.92s - 2794.36s |  A lot of times we're also not making the decision.
2794.36s - 2795.92s |  We are advocating for you.
2795.96s - 2797.56s |  When we ask for the justifications,
2797.56s - 2799.28s |  not because Pedro and I want to be nosy
2799.28s - 2800.80s |  and be on inside your business.
2800.80s - 2803.44s |  It's that way when we take that information
2803.44s - 2804.88s |  and we're going and we're advocating,
2804.88s - 2806.56s |  we're arguing for you.
2806.56s - 2809.32s |  You know, there are behind backroom deals
2809.32s - 2810.72s |  that we're trying to work for you
2810.72s - 2812.64s |  to ensure that you guys get as much support
2812.64s - 2813.96s |  as we possibly can for you.
2813.96s - 2816.12s |  And that's our entire role in this, so.
2816.12s - 2816.96s |  I'm gonna pivot off that real quick.
2816.96s - 2818.76s |  I have one quick thing to add.
2818.76s - 2819.60s |  Hold on.
2819.60s - 2820.44s |  It's really small.
2820.44s - 2822.00s |  I just wanna say one thing, six minute warning.
2822.00s - 2824.12s |  Oh, I just wanna say,
2824.12s - 2826.76s |  I think maybe when Kevin or you guys took over,
2826.76s - 2828.92s |  I can't remember, but prior to that,
2828.92s - 2831.36s |  us village leads and the ones that run everything,
2831.36s - 2834.64s |  we used to only get like three or four of these.
2834.64s - 2836.68s |  So with having a staff of 30 or 40 people
2836.68s - 2837.92s |  and only getting three or four of these
2837.92s - 2839.08s |  and trying to bring people in and out
2839.08s - 2840.80s |  while we're setting up is very difficult.
2840.80s - 2843.64s |  So it's been very nice that over the last few years,
2843.64s - 2846.28s |  they've been able to get us like 20 badges or 30 badges
2846.28s - 2848.48s |  because that's actually the amount of staff that we have.
2848.48s - 2849.68s |  And then we don't have the issues
2849.68s - 2851.08s |  of people coming in and out during setup.
2851.08s - 2853.96s |  So I just wanna say that there has been a lot of improvements
2854.80s - 2855.84s |  in the badges and getting us that access
2855.84s - 2857.16s |  because prior to it, it was like,
2857.16s - 2859.08s |  you'd give it, they'd give us four, maybe five.
2859.08s - 2861.64s |  And it's like, it's not really helping us.
2861.64s - 2864.60s |  So they have definitely helped us a lot more on that side.
2864.60s - 2866.80s |  So what I was gonna add, I think someone,
2866.80s - 2869.08s |  I heard the word equitable and it triggered something.
2869.08s - 2873.16s |  So the main reason that I think we really wanna have
2873.16s - 2878.00s |  more badges is because we have volunteers year over year
2878.00s - 2881.44s |  who are newer to the industry,
2881.44s - 2883.76s |  could really benefit from being here at DEF CON,
2884.56s - 2887.36s |  but don't have the financial resources to afford much.
2887.36s - 2889.28s |  So they're splitting shitty hotel rooms,
2889.28s - 2893.08s |  getting cheap flights and 400 plus dollars
2893.08s - 2895.56s |  for a badge is actually quite a lot.
2895.56s - 2896.64s |  So, and that's one of the things
2896.64s - 2898.40s |  that we can quantifiably provide
2898.40s - 2901.32s |  to those volunteers and staff.
2902.24s - 2903.88s |  That's ultimately like we're here
2903.88s - 2905.88s |  to provide content to people.
2905.88s - 2907.92s |  I think a secondary reason that we're here
2907.92s - 2910.60s |  is to help people grow in their careers
2910.60s - 2911.76s |  and to help them network.
2911.76s - 2913.28s |  Like we've had, as Blue Team Village,
2913.28s - 2914.72s |  we've had so many people get jobs
2914.72s - 2917.28s |  because of volunteering for the village.
2917.28s - 2919.52s |  Actually, my last two jobs I got
2919.52s - 2921.52s |  because of people I knew from Blue Team Village.
2921.52s - 2922.76s |  And I wouldn't have been able to do that
2922.76s - 2925.84s |  if I couldn't afford to come here and volunteer originally.
2925.84s - 2927.60s |  My question is, what are you doing
2927.60s - 2929.92s |  with any of that money you might make?
2929.92s - 2931.84s |  Because it's what we do is all the money
2931.84s - 2932.80s |  we're making during this.
2932.80s - 2934.64s |  So we sell badges, obviously,
2934.64s - 2937.16s |  we're a nonprofit organization as well.
2937.16s - 2939.56s |  The way our board works is all the money we make from this,
2939.56s - 2941.12s |  we dump back into this.
2941.16s - 2943.68s |  None of us make any of it, none of us keep any of it.
2943.68s - 2945.64s |  That's why we're giving away a car this year.
2945.64s - 2947.40s |  But we take our money and we pour it
2947.40s - 2949.04s |  right back into DEF CON.
2949.04s - 2951.48s |  So I'm just curious what you guys are doing with your money
2951.48s - 2953.72s |  because I try to, like this year,
2953.72s - 2956.16s |  I knew one of my volunteers that came out,
2956.16s - 2958.28s |  a younger kid, kind of from a family
2958.28s - 2960.00s |  that doesn't have a lot of finances.
2960.00s - 2962.96s |  And I was able to buy his flight and help him get out here.
2962.96s - 2964.96s |  And I've done that with a lot of other people as well.
2964.96s - 2967.28s |  I know like Kamal's right here in the stands.
2967.28s - 2969.00s |  He's from Japan, we flew him out here.
2969.00s - 2972.60s |  So we try to do the best we can to fund our staff as well
2972.60s - 2974.48s |  outside of what DEF CON gives us
2974.48s - 2976.16s |  based off of what you guys are giving to us
2976.16s - 2979.76s |  through badges or other things like that, so.
2979.76s - 2981.16s |  Yeah, that's a constant thing that we're working on,
2981.16s - 2983.20s |  trying to bring it back to supporting
2983.20s - 2986.04s |  the people that make this village possible.
2986.04s - 2987.64s |  And I think Nina and I have had
2987.64s - 2989.32s |  some side conversations about that.
2989.32s - 2990.96s |  So maybe I'll hand it over to you
2990.96s - 2993.56s |  and you can add to that for two minutes.
2993.56s - 2994.44s |  Five minute warning.
2994.44s - 2995.76s |  50 seconds on the clock.
2996.76s - 2999.12s |  So just circling back to the other question,
2999.12s - 3001.00s |  there's eight people on the core for us.
3001.00s - 3005.76s |  And then it's, this year we have 25 people
3005.76s - 3010.64s |  that are bringing people in through the Hippocratic Oathing.
3010.64s - 3011.96s |  But at the end of the day,
3011.96s - 3013.80s |  there's about 300 people that I am managing
3013.80s - 3015.80s |  that one, I've probably never met before.
3015.80s - 3018.92s |  And two, that are highly committed to doing village stuff.
3018.92s - 3020.60s |  A lot of them don't end up leaving the village
3020.60s - 3023.20s |  because it's highly interactive, it's immersive,
3023.20s - 3024.76s |  all of that.
3024.80s - 3026.36s |  I don't remember your question.
3026.36s - 3027.52s |  What do we do with the money?
3027.52s - 3028.52s |  Is that what we do with the money?
3028.52s - 3029.36s |  Sorry.
3029.36s - 3030.20s |  Like supporting volunteers.
3030.20s - 3031.72s |  Oh, supporting volunteers.
3031.72s - 3035.52s |  I, ooh, there's a lot of work that goes into this.
3035.52s - 3038.36s |  So I pay for at least the core people.
3038.36s - 3040.36s |  I pay for their flights, I pay for their hotels,
3040.36s - 3043.40s |  I give them a stipend, and everybody is on their way.
3043.40s - 3046.32s |  Because again, this is, it's eight hours
3046.32s - 3048.44s |  that the attendees get to be in the room,
3048.44s - 3050.32s |  but it's like a 12 hour day for all of us.
3050.32s - 3052.80s |  Because they're still set up and there's, yeah.
3052.80s - 3054.52s |  It's like 14, 15 most of the time.
3055.28s - 3056.12s |  Oh no, I mean during the con,
3056.12s - 3058.48s |  because before that we're here for like forever.
3059.36s - 3061.64s |  And it's ensuring that the attendees
3061.64s - 3063.36s |  get the experience that they came here for, right?
3063.36s - 3065.12s |  You're paying a lot for this conference.
3065.12s - 3067.32s |  We want you to have everything that you need
3067.32s - 3069.16s |  to one, be involved.
3069.16s - 3072.12s |  Two, three, oh my God, English is hard today.
3072.12s - 3074.12s |  Two, be invested.
3075.08s - 3077.32s |  The other part of this is, what do we do with the money?
3077.32s - 3078.72s |  It just gets poured back in.
3078.72s - 3081.68s |  This year, Biohacking Village is functioning at a loss
3081.68s - 3084.56s |  because there's, to a lot of the points, right?
3084.56s - 3086.28s |  There's a lot of investment that we had to do.
3086.28s - 3088.40s |  We are not getting a lot of the money back
3088.40s - 3091.56s |  because we just, our prices aren't high
3091.56s - 3093.44s |  because we need everybody to do the things.
3093.44s - 3094.72s |  So at the end of the day,
3094.72s - 3096.80s |  it's what conference are we going to next?
3096.80s - 3099.88s |  How do we get support from the people in this room,
3099.88s - 3105.79s |  the sponsors, the community, DEF CON, things like that.
3105.79s - 3108.11s |  Any last questions before we have to stop?
3108.11s - 3108.95s |  I think there's a question in the crowd.
3108.95s - 3118.08s |  We got a question out here.
3118.08s - 3119.24s |  So we're not associated with.
3120.00s - 3122.56s |  Yeah, none of us are subsidiaries.
3122.56s - 3125.08s |  So he asked us, are we all 5013Cs
3125.08s - 3127.72s |  and are we subsidiaries of, yeah, English is hard.
3127.72s - 3129.32s |  Are we subsidiaries of DEF CON?
3129.32s - 3132.64s |  And the answer of the 5013C is it's spotty.
3132.64s - 3135.04s |  Some of us are, some of us might not be,
3135.04s - 3137.08s |  but none of us are subsidiaries of DEF CON.
3137.08s - 3140.78s |  We are all independent organizations.
3140.78s - 3142.26s |  Yeah, so a lot of the villages though,
3142.26s - 3143.70s |  and a lot of the newer ones,
3143.70s - 3146.90s |  I think are the ones that aren't 5013Cs.
3146.90s - 3148.94s |  We encourage them to push that way
3148.94s - 3150.58s |  because it actually changes a lot of the landscape
3150.58s - 3152.50s |  for them at DEF CON.
3152.50s - 3155.14s |  And it opens up some additional funding avenues
3155.14s - 3157.94s |  potentially in the future for us, for them as well, so.
3161.90s - 3163.98s |  What is the corporate structure of DEF CON itself?
3163.98s - 3165.30s |  That's probably outside the scope of this panel.
3165.30s - 3166.14s |  Yeah, and we got two minutes left.
3166.14s - 3167.38s |  Tony doesn't want to answer that either.
3167.38s - 3169.66s |  I definitely don't want to answer that.
3169.66s - 3170.50s |  Yeah, I guess-
3170.50s - 3171.58s |  I mean, maybe do like a 30 second,
3171.58s - 3173.22s |  like for each wrap up or something.
3173.22s - 3174.06s |  Yeah, yeah.
3174.06s - 3174.90s |  Hey, go for it.
3174.90s - 3175.74s |  You want to go first?
3175.74s - 3176.58s |  For what?
3176.58s - 3177.42s |  30 second wrap up.
3177.42s - 3179.26s |  Oh, come down to Isis Village.
3179.26s - 3180.86s |  You'll see everything we have,
3180.90s - 3182.82s |  like escape rooms and sponsors, volunteers,
3182.82s - 3183.70s |  all that other stuff.
3183.70s - 3185.14s |  They're really cool hands-on things.
3185.14s - 3189.14s |  Remember, ICS is in manufacturing cars in the hospitals.
3189.14s - 3191.86s |  We do have jobs also.
3191.86s - 3195.18s |  Airports, without ICS, airports don't work.
3195.18s - 3196.86s |  So we're everywhere.
3196.86s - 3198.10s |  Come down and talk to us.
3199.62s - 3200.74s |  Yes, here.
3200.74s - 3201.58s |  Sweet, Tom.
3201.58s - 3202.82s |  So you're going to take my job, right?
3202.82s - 3203.66s |  Yes.
3203.66s - 3205.10s |  You own all of us, so it sounds like Tom's next.
3205.10s - 3205.94s |  Sweet.
3205.94s - 3206.78s |  Cool, thanks.
3206.78s - 3208.42s |  Yeah, so Justin Carrick Village.
3208.42s - 3209.38s |  Definitely come check us out.
3209.38s - 3211.50s |  We got a tractor here, semi-truck.
3211.50s - 3214.58s |  We have Rivian who actually put a CTF in their vehicle,
3214.58s - 3216.54s |  so you can actually hack their vehicle.
3216.54s - 3219.02s |  Obviously, it's not a vulnerability in the car.
3219.02s - 3221.50s |  They made it vulnerable theirself and put flags in it.
3221.50s - 3222.34s |  So it's really cool.
3222.34s - 3224.54s |  And we're also giving away a Tesla
3224.54s - 3225.98s |  for our first place prize.
3225.98s - 3226.82s |  And outside of that,
3226.82s - 3228.38s |  we've also done stuff for kids this year.
3228.38s - 3229.22s |  We have a kid's badge
3229.22s - 3231.78s |  that we've been giving away to the kids.
3231.78s - 3233.42s |  And yeah, we're just trying to do as much as we can
3233.42s - 3234.50s |  to give back to the community
3234.50s - 3236.02s |  and making sure that all the money
3236.02s - 3236.90s |  that you guys might give us,
3236.90s - 3238.82s |  either through donations or through badges,
3238.86s - 3240.10s |  we pour back into this event
3240.10s - 3241.86s |  so that way we can keep running it every year
3241.86s - 3244.30s |  and go bigger and bigger if we can.
3244.30s - 3245.22s |  Everything they said.
3245.22s - 3246.54s |  And come to the Biohacking Village.
3246.54s - 3247.38s |  You are all patients.
3247.38s - 3248.54s |  You should all be very concerned
3248.54s - 3251.50s |  about the vulnerabilities in these medical devices
3251.50s - 3252.70s |  because they will affect your life.
3252.70s - 3254.74s |  And every single one of these villages
3254.74s - 3258.22s |  impacts Biohacking Village and the medical care you do get.
3258.22s - 3259.18s |  I'll keep it brief.
3259.18s - 3260.14s |  And just to say,
3260.14s - 3261.62s |  if you're thinking about getting involved with the village,
3261.62s - 3262.46s |  go volunteer.
3262.46s - 3263.58s |  It'll change your life.
3263.58s - 3264.58s |  Come see the Red Team Village.
3264.58s - 3266.70s |  We have lots of workshops and talks still today.
3266.70s - 3267.54s |  Most of us are, I think,
3267.54s - 3269.22s |  closing probably like around like 12-ish today,
3269.22s - 3270.14s |  but still come see us.
3270.14s - 3270.98s |  We'd love to have you guys.
3270.98s - 3272.38s |  Lots of swag at Red Team Village still.
3272.38s - 3273.78s |  Please come and take it all.
3274.74s - 3275.58s |  Okay.
3275.58s - 3276.42s |  Airplanes are cool.
3276.42s - 3277.54s |  Space is cool.
3278.54s - 3279.42s |  Drones are cool.
3279.42s - 3281.02s |  Come see us in Aerospace Village.
3281.02s - 3288.56s |  Pilots are cool.
3288.56s - 3290.48s |  My 10 second spiel is,
3290.48s - 3294.00s |  Pedro and I have quit at least four times each this year.
3294.00s - 3295.48s |  The only reason that we're still around
3295.48s - 3298.56s |  is because we've done it on alternating points,
3298.56s - 3300.68s |  but also because of these amazing people,
3300.68s - 3301.64s |  all the village leaders,
3301.64s - 3304.76s |  they do an amazing job bringing content to DEF CON.
3305.64s - 3306.48s |  Thank you.
3306.48s - 3307.32s |  I'm just here for the swag.
3308.44s - 3309.44s |  And to hack cars.
