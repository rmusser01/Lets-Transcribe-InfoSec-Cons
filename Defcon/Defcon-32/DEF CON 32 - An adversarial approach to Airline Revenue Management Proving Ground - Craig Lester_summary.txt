**Introduction to Airline Revenue Management**
- **Richard Branson's Quote**: Quickest way to become a millionaire in the airline industry is to start as a billionaire.
- **Constraints**: High fixed capital costs, bilateral capacity treaties, airport slots, curfews, labor.
- **Purpose**: Airlines use revenue management to fill planes, maximize earnings, and keep competitors at bay.
- **Focus**: Introduction to fares, ticketing, system constraints, and vulnerabilities.

**Airline Industry Overview**
- **High Fixed Costs**: Approval needed from both governments to operate flights; application for slots at congested airports.
- **Fortress Hubs**: Dominant market hold by certain airlines at major hubs.
- **Slot Management**: Airlines sometimes fly empty planes to maintain airport slots.

**Revenue Management**
- **Objective**: Maximize return by filling aircrafts, ensuring the highest price for every seat.
- **Challenges**: Avoid selling seats too cheap or letting them go empty.

**Airline Pricing and Fares**
- **Dynamic Inventory**: Complex computational calculations for managing inventory and pricing.
- **Fare Rules**: Include restrictions like days of the week and dynamic pricing algorithms.
- **Published Fares**: Base fare shown before adding taxes and surcharges.

**Ticketing and Reservations**
- **Reservation System**: Having a PNR (Passenger Name Record) doesn't guarantee boarding without a valid e-ticket.
- **Dynamic Inventory Management**: Use of "buckets" with letters to manage pricing and seat availability.

**Exploit Vulnerabilities**
- **Hidden City Ticketing**: Practice where flying to a layover city is cheaper than the final destination.
- **Mistake Fares**: Errors in fare publication can lead to extremely low ticket prices.

**Electronic Flight Bags (EFBs)**
- **Purpose**: Devices used by pilots to improve operational safety and efficiency.
- **Potential Vulnerabilities**: Physical access can lead to data manipulation, affecting flight safety.
- **Lockdown Quality**: Lack of security measures such as MDM or strong passwords.

**Aviation Bugs and Incidents**
- **American Airlines Incident**: Lockup due to database duplication.
- **Southwest Weather Bug**: Loss of weather feed halted flights.
- **Alaska Airlines Tail Strike**: Software miscalculated weight and balance.

**Cybersecurity in Aviation**
- **Network Segregation**: Separation between passenger information and aircraft control domains.
- **Disclosure and Fixes**: Importance of responsible disclosure and regulatory involvement in fixing vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion**
- **Complexity of Aviation Systems**: Importance of safety and responsible handling of vulnerabilities.
- **Resources for Disclosure**: Aviation ISAC and DEFCON Aerospace Village as aids for vulnerability disclosure.
