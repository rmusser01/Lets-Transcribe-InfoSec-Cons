**Introduction**
- Speaker: Emma Stewart, Chief Power Grid Scientist at Idaho National Laboratory
- Focus: Renewable energy security and the challenges in the energy transition

**Current Energy Challenges**
- **Climate Change and Weather**: Increasing frequency of $10 billion weather events affecting power grids
- **Emissions**: Energy sector contributes 28% of emissions, prompting a shift to renewable energy
- **Power Grid Evolution**: Transition from large generators to distributed systems and energy storage

**Renewable Energy Transition**
- **Energy Storage and Electric Vehicles**: Key components in modernizing power systems
- **Cloud-Based Applications**: Necessary for small utilities' modernization due to lack of local data centers
- **Supply Chain Issues**: Heavy reliance on Chinese-manufactured components for renewable energy systems

**Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**
- **Chinese Manufacturing Dominance**: Significant portion of components made in China
- **Policy and Security Concerns**: Military bases and utilities using Chinese-manufactured batteries face security challenges
- **Rip and Replace Policy Limitations**: Attempts to replace foreign components are underfunded and ineffective

**Technical and Security Risks**
- **Component Reliability**: Inverters fail every 15 years, posing opportunities and challenges for replacement
- **Cybersecurity Risks**: Hard-coded passwords, insecure applications, and lack of vulnerability disclosures
- **Ransomware and Denial of Service**: Previous attacks have not caused power outages but highlight vulnerabilities

**Policy and Regulatory Challenges**
- **Consumer Responsibility**: Individuals often responsible for securing and updating their renewable energy systems
- **Regulation and Enforcement Gaps**: Unclear regulatory responsibilities due to complex ownership and supply chains
- **Investment Needs**: Demand signals required for domestic manufacturing and investment in renewable technologies

**Recommendations for Policy Change**
- **Ban and Replace Limitations**: Current strategies may lead to further complications in the supply chain
- **Inspection and Analysis**: Need for thorough vulnerability analysis of imported components
- **Contractual and Regulatory Improvements**: Enhanced contract requirements and clearer regulatory frameworks needed

**Conclusion**
- **Renewable Energy Imperative**: Essential to combat climate change despite challenges
- **Policy and Technology Solutions**: Necessary to address supply chain vulnerabilities and ensure secure energy transition
