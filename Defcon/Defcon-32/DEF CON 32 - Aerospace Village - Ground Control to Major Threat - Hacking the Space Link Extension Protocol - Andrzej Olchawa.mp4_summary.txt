**Introduction**
- Speaker introduces himself as Andy, working in open source security in the **space industry** in Europe.
- Questions audience on their knowledge and involvement in the **space industry** and **SLE** protocol.

**Hacking Satellites**
- **Hacking satellites** is not new but often focuses on the **space segment**.
- Speaker argues the **ground segment** is more vulnerable due to a larger **attack surface**.

**Presentation Overview**
- **Presentation** will compare **space** and **ground segments** in terms of **attack surface**.
- Introduction to the **SLE protocol** and its **security aspects**.
- Demonstration of exploitation methods and mitigations.

**Space and Ground Segments**
- **Space segment** is complex but has a small **attack surface** due to single entry point.
- **Ground segment** is less complex but has a larger **attack surface** due to many available elements.
- **Ground segment** uses standard infrastructure, making it vulnerable to common **vulnerabilities**.

**SLE Protocol**
- **SLE** is a protocol developed by **CCSDS** for sending telecommands and receiving telemetry.
- Based on **TCP/IP**, supports **transport layer, encoding, and authentication**.
- Defines roles: **SLE provider** (like a ground station) and **SLE user** (like mission control).

**Vulnerabilities and Exploits**
- **SLE protocol** lacks **data privacy** and is vulnerable to **man-in-the-middle attacks** due to lack of encryption.
- Exploitation methods include **denial-of-service**, **credential capture**, and **data tampering**.

**Demonstrations**
- Demonstrations show vulnerabilities such as preventing authentication, capturing credentials, and altering data sent to spacecraft.
- **Exploits** leverage lack of **encryption** and poor **authentication mechanisms**.

**Conclusion and Recommendations**
- **SLE protocol** vulnerabilities can lead to control over spacecraft via **ground stations**.
- **CCSDS** is working on mitigating issues with **space data link security**, but ground segments remain vulnerable.
- **Recommendation** to use **CCSDS PKI** for encrypted communication to resolve current vulnerabilities.

- **Resources** and further documentation are publicly available for deeper understanding.
