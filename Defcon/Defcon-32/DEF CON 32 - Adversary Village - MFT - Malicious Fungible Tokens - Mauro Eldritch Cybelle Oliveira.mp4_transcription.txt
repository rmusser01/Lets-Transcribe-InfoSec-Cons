 Welcome everybody to our talk, Malicious Fungible Tokens.
3.44s - 6.56s |  My name is Mauro and my partner today is Yvelle.
6.56s - 8.96s |  We welcome you, thank you for choosing our talk.
10.00s - 11.80s |  Hey everyone, good evening.
11.80s - 13.20s |  Hi, how are you doing?
13.20s - 15.68s |  Thanks for being here to our talk.
15.68s - 18.40s |  First, of course, English is not our first language.
18.40s - 19.88s |  We have a little bit accent,
19.88s - 22.16s |  so if you don't understand any word,
22.16s - 24.32s |  please raise your hands or say,
24.32s - 26.96s |  you are saying so much bullshit in English.
27.00s - 31.88s |  That's okay, because we can improve our English, okay?
31.88s - 33.44s |  Thank you.
33.44s - 34.72s |  So let us start.
35.64s - 37.28s |  As I said, my name is Yvelle.
37.28s - 39.20s |  I'm from Brazil, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
39.20s - 41.16s |  I work at Cyber Threat Intelligence,
41.16s - 44.12s |  and well, I like malware.
44.12s - 46.44s |  I like to research about malwares,
46.44s - 48.52s |  hands-on wares, and things like this.
48.52s - 51.92s |  It's pretty cool, you know, I know how it works.
53.60s - 54.76s |  Well, my name is Mauro.
54.76s - 56.72s |  I'm a Uruguayan-Argentinian hacker.
57.48s - 58.60s |  I'm here today to show this talk,
58.60s - 60.84s |  and I spoke at different events around the world,
60.84s - 62.76s |  and I'm the leader of the Bits of Quetzal team,
62.76s - 64.76s |  which is the first Latin American
64.76s - 67.24s |  Web3 threats research team.
69.98s - 72.18s |  This talk, we are going to use NFTs
72.18s - 75.66s |  as immortal command and control servers.
75.66s - 77.50s |  We are not going to sell you any NFT.
77.50s - 80.14s |  We are not going to try to put you into crypto,
80.14s - 82.50s |  so we are not going to make you invest into anything.
82.50s - 84.10s |  This talk is the continuation,
84.10s - 86.58s |  or the spiritual successor of Everything is a C2
86.58s - 87.78s |  if you are brave enough,
87.78s - 89.98s |  which was a talk at the previous Adversary Village,
89.98s - 92.70s |  where we used the Spotify, World of Warcraft,
92.70s - 94.86s |  Wikipedia, and whatever you can name
94.86s - 96.50s |  as a C2 server in the past.
97.94s - 101.34s |  So, this talk is 30 minutes only,
101.34s - 103.70s |  but it's divided in two parts, okay?
103.70s - 105.70s |  First, I will give ingredients,
105.70s - 108.46s |  and then, Mauro, you cook this, okay?
108.46s - 110.86s |  First, let me introduce you Podo,
110.86s - 112.98s |  or Leopoldo, is his dog,
112.98s - 115.94s |  amazing dog, a golden retriever, okay?
116.38s - 121.38s |  So, let's talk, let's clarify what's NFT,
122.46s - 125.58s |  C2 servers, and lovely golden retriever,
125.58s - 127.02s |  the lovely dog.
127.02s - 131.74s |  So, NFTs, basically, they are all information
131.74s - 135.30s |  when you upload, you know,
135.30s - 137.74s |  a NFT in a blockchain,
137.74s - 139.70s |  this is all information storage,
139.70s - 142.54s |  and, well, everything is there,
142.54s - 145.78s |  data, metadata, and things like that.
146.62s - 149.86s |  But, you can store this image as well off-chain,
149.86s - 154.86s |  I mean, in a decentralized platform for this,
155.14s - 158.90s |  and is immortal as well, you know,
158.90s - 162.50s |  you can change like in blockchain,
162.50s - 164.30s |  this is very important.
164.30s - 165.90s |  So, we have two types, you know,
165.90s - 168.98s |  how we can store our image,
168.98s - 171.46s |  on-chain and off-chain,
171.46s - 174.30s |  on blockchain and not in blockchain.
174.30s - 178.14s |  Oops, sorry, okay, sorry.
178.14s - 181.14s |  So, what is a C2 command and control servers?
181.14s - 183.78s |  It's a server that we can send
183.78s - 186.02s |  and receive information of malware,
186.02s - 189.70s |  so we can use this in everywhere, right?
189.70s - 191.46s |  But not in this case.
191.46s - 196.26s |  But the problem is, if I try to do something in NFT,
196.26s - 198.86s |  if I use a regular server, you know,
198.86s - 200.94s |  for C2, what can happen?
201.18s - 204.42s |  He can be, this can be banned,
204.42s - 206.90s |  or blacklisted, you know,
206.90s - 209.26s |  and at least that denial lists,
209.26s - 213.38s |  or everything can be messy and can be take down,
213.38s - 216.02s |  even if it's in Tor browser.
216.02s - 218.54s |  So, yeah, works, of course,
218.54s - 220.62s |  but, yeah, for not in this case.
220.62s - 221.74s |  This particular case,
221.74s - 225.02s |  we need something more resilient, right?
226.58s - 227.42s |  So,
227.58s - 231.74s |  um, as I said, blockchain, I don't know,
231.74s - 236.62s |  everybody's familiar with blockchain, I guess, right?
236.62s - 238.98s |  So, everything is there,
238.98s - 241.06s |  backup assets there is permanent,
241.06s - 244.06s |  you can change, it's there and that's it.
244.06s - 246.26s |  You just upload there and you keep there.
246.26s - 249.94s |  Can ban it, can flag anything.
249.94s - 254.62s |  But, usually NFTs can be stored there,
254.62s - 258.30s |  or no, can be, NFT is an image.
259.26s - 263.10s |  In NFT image, you can put like name, description,
263.10s - 267.18s |  trade, and everything, including metadata is there, right?
268.50s - 272.42s |  So, instead we do this with that ugly monkeys,
272.42s - 275.02s |  we, everybody saw that ugly monkeys are rare,
275.02s - 279.90s |  or weird image, because we see weird image from artists
279.90s - 282.18s |  that say, oh, this is brand new thing,
282.18s - 285.50s |  but it's not my thing, sorry.
285.50s - 287.42s |  What about Golden Retriever?
287.42s - 289.98s |  They are really, really cool, and it's a dog.
289.98s - 292.54s |  Too bad it's not a cat, but let's start with a dog,
292.54s - 294.46s |  maybe the next time, right?
294.46s - 295.82s |  Maybe.
295.82s - 298.98s |  Now, let's explain what is this.
298.98s - 301.98s |  Mostly, NFTs, there's a platform,
301.98s - 304.38s |  the most known one is OpenSea.
304.38s - 306.50s |  That one with the ugly monkey,
307.34s - 309.14s |  that was hacked several times,
309.14s - 311.38s |  but it's not about this talk.
312.18s - 315.26s |  This is a very big market, probably is white list
315.26s - 319.58s |  for almost all Web3 companies.
319.58s - 322.22s |  All traffic go through this API.
322.22s - 326.26s |  Okay, but that is off-chain too.
326.26s - 330.74s |  It's partially stored in on-chain,
330.74s - 332.34s |  I mean, in the blockchain,
332.34s - 336.50s |  but the metadata is decentralized in the other places,
336.50s - 339.26s |  like this file systems in other place.
339.26s - 341.14s |  Now, this is very important.
341.14s - 343.78s |  When we use decentralized metadata,
343.78s - 346.82s |  where, can be in many, many place,
346.82s - 349.02s |  but here is specifically talk
349.02s - 351.70s |  about interplanetary file system.
351.70s - 355.90s |  I don't know if everybody is familiar with this.
355.90s - 359.74s |  It's a cool place, it's a decentralized platforms.
359.74s - 361.78s |  It's like torrent, you know,
361.78s - 364.74s |  when you try to download or upload a file,
364.74s - 368.06s |  a music there, you have seats, no?
368.06s - 372.18s |  So this seats, everything is share among the seats.
372.18s - 376.54s |  And when you have this, you hold this files
376.54s - 380.22s |  and you can share, you know, and hold this files,
380.22s - 381.94s |  you have, you receive coins.
381.94s - 386.50s |  I mean, you are paid, you know, to have this files.
386.50s - 388.82s |  This is really nice for who's, you know,
388.82s - 392.86s |  who have this, you have this files is Filecoin,
392.86s - 394.90s |  I guess the name, yes, right?
395.18s - 398.70s |  And then this image, when you upload there,
398.70s - 401.46s |  is converted in another kind of file,
401.46s - 406.46s |  this AVIF, I'm not so familiar with this kind of,
406.82s - 409.58s |  you know, I'm not an artist to convert the images.
409.58s - 412.46s |  And then the original file that's stored
412.46s - 415.46s |  in this decentralized place
415.46s - 419.22s |  is highly distributed among the seats.
419.22s - 421.34s |  And this is the thing, you know,
421.38s - 425.14s |  everything is in the seats, all these files.
425.14s - 429.82s |  So starting from here is the thing, you know,
429.82s - 431.22s |  what we're talking about.
431.22s - 433.78s |  Please explain what we do with this files
433.78s - 435.90s |  that are decentralized.
435.90s - 438.74s |  Well, the point with Interplanetary File System
438.74s - 442.46s |  is that it's used widely by Lockheed Martin, IBM,
442.46s - 444.34s |  other high vendors.
444.34s - 446.78s |  The point is that everything is distributed.
446.78s - 448.98s |  Anyone can run an APFS node.
448.98s - 450.54s |  So if you want to take something down,
450.54s - 454.46s |  you have to ask every single node owner to take it down.
454.46s - 456.74s |  But as my partner here said,
456.74s - 459.22s |  OpenSea and some other platforms reward you
459.22s - 462.62s |  for holding the file or sharing the file with Filecoin.
462.62s - 465.30s |  So if you get a hold of a file,
465.30s - 467.38s |  everybody deletes it and you have it,
467.38s - 470.42s |  there's a supply-demand problem here.
470.42s - 473.26s |  You can make lots of money by being the last one,
473.26s - 475.18s |  the last holder of that file.
475.18s - 479.30s |  So that opens the path to certain kind of abuses
479.30s - 482.78s |  of people not actually honoring takedown requests.
485.72s - 487.36s |  Okay, so now comes my part.
488.76s - 490.52s |  This sounds pretty good in theory,
490.52s - 493.08s |  but we have to make it into code,
493.08s - 494.40s |  especially into Ruby code.
494.40s - 496.24s |  So if any one of you knows Ruby,
496.24s - 497.44s |  know that it's maybe nice,
497.44s - 500.88s |  but it's not as flexible as other languages.
500.88s - 502.76s |  So what we need right now,
502.76s - 507.28s |  we need a malicious situ server,
507.28s - 511.08s |  a malware that can interpret and send command from NFTs
511.88s - 512.72s |  and obviously the malicious NFTs.
512.72s - 514.08s |  I'm going to switch the mic.
515.20s - 516.64s |  Okay, I'm back here.
517.76s - 519.88s |  So for this experiment,
519.88s - 520.72s |  we have Leopoldo,
520.72s - 523.84s |  I presented him in the previous slides.
523.84s - 525.48s |  We have four NFTs,
525.48s - 528.36s |  which every single one does anything different.
528.36s - 531.32s |  And we're going to test different attack vectors
531.32s - 534.32s |  encoded inside these NFTs.
534.32s - 535.84s |  We have Initial Access Marker,
535.84s - 536.76s |  Ramson Retriever,
536.76s - 537.60s |  Treat Actor,
537.60s - 538.44s |  and Golden Locker,
538.44s - 540.40s |  my personal favorite.
540.40s - 541.96s |  It's not for sale.
541.96s - 542.80s |  Okay, on the left,
542.80s - 545.88s |  you can see the malware coded in Ruby called MFT,
545.88s - 547.56s |  malicious fungible tokens.
547.56s - 548.56s |  And on the right side,
548.56s - 550.56s |  you can see the situ server
550.56s - 552.84s |  coded once again in Ruby and Sinatra.
554.16s - 558.16s |  Let's start by exploiting the most basic things in OpenSea.
558.16s - 560.08s |  Let's start by exploiting the common fields,
560.08s - 561.96s |  the low hanging fruit.
561.96s - 562.80s |  Treat Actor,
562.80s - 565.16s |  what actually does is has a description field
565.16s - 567.60s |  publicly viewable by anyone.
567.60s - 569.04s |  It's visible to anyone,
569.08s - 572.56s |  which is encoded in Base64 and Route 13.
572.56s - 573.40s |  When decoded,
573.40s - 574.72s |  it says IP address,
574.72s - 578.16s |  which is always hard-coded on all examples to localhost,
578.16s - 581.00s |  so you cannot do any damage to anyone else.
581.96s - 584.32s |  It has a code parameter
584.32s - 587.24s |  that it's actually represents Unix command
587.24s - 588.08s |  and actions,
588.08s - 590.96s |  which are actually proprietary modules of the malware.
590.96s - 593.36s |  And this is not detected by CyberChef,
593.36s - 595.40s |  even with magic on Dev10.
595.40s - 597.36s |  So that was pretty awesome for me.
598.20s - 599.92s |  Then we got GoldenLocker,
599.92s - 603.52s |  which has a description just encoded in Base64,
603.52s - 606.96s |  which is not also discovered by CyberChef
606.96s - 608.76s |  and has other actions.
608.76s - 610.40s |  We will see them in detail now.
611.32s - 612.52s |  Here's the malware
612.52s - 614.92s |  and we will have a demo at the end of this talk.
616.32s - 618.76s |  When you search for an account,
618.76s - 621.04s |  for an ENS domain name or an Ethereum account,
621.04s - 622.72s |  it will list all NFTs,
622.72s - 624.28s |  showing the newer ones first
624.28s - 627.04s |  because if you are pricing situ servers,
627.72s - 629.60s |  this one will have the latest information that you need,
629.60s - 632.36s |  the most up-to-date information and commands.
632.36s - 634.36s |  Then if you can see the contract
634.36s - 637.72s |  and the description and the collection.
637.72s - 639.40s |  And then here's the thing.
639.40s - 640.52s |  If you see the description,
640.52s - 644.24s |  you will see the encoded payload.
644.24s - 645.32s |  But if you see below,
645.32s - 648.48s |  you will see the URL for the picture and the metadata.
648.48s - 650.40s |  And then you will go to IPFS.io
650.40s - 651.24s |  and here you will say,
651.24s - 656.24s |  Mauro, what happens if I send a takedown request to IPFS.io?
656.68s - 657.64s |  Absolutely nothing,
657.64s - 661.68s |  because IPFS.io is just an IPFS browser.
661.68s - 663.32s |  All this information is stored
663.32s - 666.80s |  on different IPSF nodes across the world
666.80s - 668.48s |  and you have to make a takedown request
668.48s - 669.76s |  to every single one.
671.48s - 675.72s |  Then, if anyone of you is familiar with Terraform,
675.72s - 677.88s |  actually Terraform has Terraform plan
677.88s - 680.72s |  which will show you what changes will happen
680.72s - 682.36s |  before you push the button.
682.36s - 684.08s |  So you can avoid something like,
684.08s - 685.80s |  you know, CrowdStrike incident.
686.28s - 687.36s |  Things like that.
687.36s - 690.12s |  So actually, I tried to implement that.
690.12s - 693.36s |  It's a function I'm super in love with.
693.36s - 695.72s |  So the malware will tell you what's going to happen
695.72s - 697.28s |  once you run that NFT.
697.28s - 698.88s |  Will they go and tell you step-by-step
698.88s - 701.64s |  what's going to happen before you push the button?
702.68s - 704.64s |  And then you will see it running in action
704.64s - 705.88s |  as you can see here.
705.88s - 709.76s |  They will say, okay, I'm using this server as a relay.
709.76s - 711.92s |  I will run this custom code, WhoAmI,
711.92s - 714.28s |  which answers back with Mauro Eldridge ID,
714.28s - 716.64s |  which answers back with my ID,
716.64s - 719.04s |  host name, and so on.
719.04s - 721.84s |  There are some fake functions that I have not coded in,
721.84s - 723.48s |  obviously, for obvious reasons,
723.48s - 726.48s |  that are wipe, encrypt, and open a reverse shell.
726.48s - 727.68s |  That won't work at all.
728.88s - 731.24s |  And this is what the attacker will see
731.24s - 733.48s |  from the Citrus server.
733.48s - 735.04s |  We'll see all the answers.
735.04s - 737.80s |  For example, new exfiltration from localhost
737.80s - 738.76s |  and everything that happens.
738.76s - 741.92s |  But let's see how it works in the back.
741.92s - 746.12s |  Before exploiting this, which is a super low-hanging fruit,
746.12s - 748.16s |  we will try to do something more complex.
748.16s - 750.52s |  Remember that my partner told that
750.52s - 752.72s |  once you send a picture to an NFT,
752.72s - 756.48s |  it will be stored in ABIF format and decentralized.
756.48s - 759.16s |  Well, the original file, the raw file,
759.16s - 762.48s |  will be decentralized as well for no apparent reason.
762.48s - 766.36s |  So that's where we can inject more shenanigans.
766.36s - 768.16s |  On this case, I just wanted to test
768.16s - 769.72s |  that the steganography will work.
769.72s - 771.96s |  So I put Mauro Eldritch was here.
771.96s - 774.64s |  The method is the most simple method on steganography,
774.64s - 776.24s |  less single bit or LSB,
777.28s - 780.28s |  which has a hard-coded location that everyone knows.
782.04s - 784.48s |  And then, if you see here, you have, once again,
784.48s - 787.08s |  the picture URL and the metadata URL.
787.08s - 788.60s |  Let's try to download the picture
788.60s - 792.44s |  and check if the message made it to production on OpenSea.
792.44s - 795.48s |  And for nobody's surprise, once downloaded,
795.48s - 797.08s |  and check it with setsteg,
797.08s - 799.32s |  which is a third-party tool I do not own,
799.92s - 802.12s |  you can see the message replicated.
802.12s - 805.32s |  This means that we can decentralize messages,
805.32s - 807.32s |  steganographic messages,
807.32s - 809.88s |  across all the world of using OpenSea.
809.88s - 811.76s |  Why is this so important?
811.76s - 816.76s |  Because the malware will only send traffic to OpenSea API.
818.72s - 821.36s |  So when doing forensics on an affected device,
821.36s - 822.76s |  you will see that the traffic
822.76s - 824.88s |  and the attack comes from OpenSea.
824.88s - 827.20s |  From nowhere else, just OpenSea.
827.20s - 828.76s |  Wrong wireshark, wrong TCP dam,
829.20s - 831.96s |  you will see only connections to OpenSea API.
833.28s - 835.96s |  And then I decided to create my, let's say,
835.96s - 839.48s |  my master art craft, Initial Access Marker,
839.48s - 841.64s |  which has all the attack vectors.
841.64s - 844.92s |  It has steganographic signal messages.
844.92s - 849.92s |  It has a trait, which is a common field on all NFTs.
850.00s - 855.00s |  But it also has something called EXIF field.
855.20s - 858.68s |  EXIF metadata is data that is usually put by machines,
859.56s - 863.80s |  by your processors, by your cameras, by your phones.
863.80s - 867.00s |  The point is, the trick here is that EXIF metadata,
867.00s - 870.80s |  it's hard to just put any arbitrary value in, you know?
870.80s - 873.08s |  You can put numbers, you have certain fields
873.08s - 875.04s |  that are more flexible than others.
875.04s - 876.76s |  But there's a field, a specific field
876.76s - 878.40s |  called profile copyright,
878.40s - 879.76s |  that allows you to put basically
879.76s - 881.36s |  anything you want without limit.
881.36s - 884.08s |  And that's where you store the payload as well.
884.08s - 888.36s |  And once you check it, once you go to any IPFS IO,
888.36s - 891.80s |  sorry, IPFS browser, you will see that
891.80s - 896.08s |  the trait is already distributed globally.
896.08s - 897.88s |  So you can rely on the trait
897.88s - 900.00s |  and not even start messing with metadata
900.00s - 903.28s |  or messing with EXIF metadata as well.
903.28s - 905.84s |  But then, I say, okay, let's try
905.84s - 908.48s |  if we can check the other two vectors.
908.48s - 910.32s |  Downloading the picture that you can see here,
910.32s - 912.16s |  which is hosted on IPFS IO,
913.16s - 916.96s |  you can see that by running EXIF tool on a specific field,
916.96s - 920.20s |  you will see, once again, the payload.
920.20s - 925.20s |  Running SetStag will render, once again, the payload.
925.68s - 928.00s |  So this adds different layers of resilience
928.00s - 931.56s |  to store the same or different payloads on a simple NFT.
931.56s - 933.08s |  Remember that minting an NFT
933.08s - 936.12s |  is something super, absolutely cheap.
936.12s - 938.92s |  So you can basically write immortal C2 servers
938.92s - 941.48s |  for five pounds, seven dollars,
941.48s - 943.84s |  or whatever is in your currency.
943.84s - 946.20s |  You can also check this with different third-party tools
946.20s - 949.48s |  you do not own to see that the payload is reflected.
949.48s - 950.92s |  And now it's time to the demos.
950.92s - 952.68s |  We are very good in time.
952.68s - 953.84s |  The demos don't have sound,
953.84s - 961.95s |  but you will enjoy my angel voice narrating it.
961.95s - 964.35s |  This, for example, is, sorry,
964.35s - 967.51s |  let's try to improve the quality
967.51s - 971.72s |  because you deserve better.
971.72s - 972.84s |  Give me a second.
972.84s - 975.28s |  Basically, what we are going to do here,
975.28s - 979.05s |  Mike, what we are going to do here
979.05s - 981.05s |  is run GoldenLocker,
981.05s - 983.65s |  one of the low-hanging fruit exploitation,
984.45s - 987.41s |  and above you can see the malware
987.41s - 989.81s |  and below you can see the C2 server.
989.81s - 992.21s |  They are both running on the same machine
992.21s - 994.33s |  in order to not damage anything.
994.33s - 996.93s |  We'll try to decode the instructions.
996.93s - 998.13s |  The network is not cooperating,
998.13s - 1000.77s |  but we will try to decode instructions
1000.77s - 1006.84s |  that are hosted on the malware.
1006.84s - 1008.28s |  Give me a second.
1008.28s - 1010.04s |  Which belongs to GoldenLocker.
1011.48s - 1014.28s |  It will then give us an action plan.
1014.28s - 1018.46s |  Sorry about that.
1018.46s - 1020.42s |  It will give us an action plan, then,
1020.42s - 1021.82s |  and what will happen?
1021.82s - 1024.50s |  It will try to run WhoAmI, id, hostname,
1024.50s - 1026.82s |  and we'll try to uniquely identify the host
1026.82s - 1028.46s |  and do some other shenanigans.
1029.78s - 1031.90s |  Then we need to execute it.
1031.90s - 1037.71s |  Sorry.
1037.71s - 1039.67s |  Hackers with tech problems.
1039.67s - 1040.51s |  Happens.
1040.51s - 1047.70s |  Ah, this happens from time to time, you know.
1047.70s - 1055.30s |  We will try to run it again.
1055.30s - 1056.74s |  The idea is to then execute it
1056.74s - 1060.62s |  and see how the commands are reflected on the other server.
1060.62s - 1062.26s |  Here it is trying to work.
1062.26s - 1068.86s |  Give it some seconds.
1068.86s - 1070.58s |  The quality is not the best,
1070.58s - 1075.52s |  but let's try to bear with it.
1075.52s - 1079.48s |  And then it tries to find a viable payload.
1079.48s - 1082.28s |  If you see here, you will see that it says,
1082.28s - 1084.44s |  I have found a tainted exif registry.
1084.44s - 1086.80s |  I have found a tainted steganographic message
1086.80s - 1088.36s |  that I can use.
1088.36s - 1091.24s |  And if it will try to find description first,
1091.24s - 1093.24s |  it will try to then jump into something
1093.24s - 1094.88s |  more complex each time
1094.88s - 1097.44s |  in order to try to use the low-hungered fruit
1097.44s - 1098.56s |  available first.
1099.88s - 1107.25s |  Sorry, just.
1107.25s - 1109.89s |  And then the idea, the final idea is that,
1109.89s - 1111.49s |  as I said before, you will see all the traffic
1111.49s - 1113.53s |  being reflected to OpenSea.
1113.53s - 1116.69s |  That makes actually difficult for forensic teams
1116.69s - 1118.69s |  to know where the tanks come from,
1118.69s - 1120.97s |  but also it will help them in another way.
1122.05s - 1126.21s |  If any of you is a defender or forensic analyst or similar,
1126.21s - 1129.85s |  you will really appreciate the value of having
1129.85s - 1132.01s |  basically immortal C2 server
1132.01s - 1133.53s |  because you will have an artifact
1133.57s - 1136.97s |  that you can dissect and check basically forever
1136.97s - 1139.01s |  and use as an example forever.
1139.01s - 1141.37s |  You won't have to rely on malware libraries
1141.37s - 1144.53s |  and you won't have to rely on, you know,
1144.53s - 1147.01s |  platforms that simulate attacks on malware.
1148.49s - 1153.66s |  Well, since this is not cooperating, I will move on.
1153.66s - 1154.58s |  I'm sorry about that.
1154.58s - 1156.02s |  Sometimes that happens.
1156.02s - 1157.78s |  Sometimes it's not easy.
1158.70s - 1163.46s |  But we'll move on.
1163.46s - 1166.50s |  And as in all crypto experiments,
1166.50s - 1168.70s |  there's something that you cannot just be safe from
1168.70s - 1170.22s |  and are scammers.
1170.22s - 1171.58s |  As soon as we published it,
1171.58s - 1173.06s |  the pictures of my golden retriever,
1173.06s - 1176.66s |  I had people trying to buy it for 15th, 20th, and so on.
1176.66s - 1179.26s |  And let me tell you, it's not worth it.
1179.26s - 1182.66s |  He showers once a month, so he smells like a seal.
1182.66s - 1183.62s |  It's not worth it.
1184.70s - 1187.62s |  And then going back to the serious track,
1188.50s - 1191.22s |  as I was discovering this and reporting these issues
1191.22s - 1194.78s |  with IPFSIO, I started seeing some ads,
1194.82s - 1196.62s |  promoted ads on Twitter.
1196.62s - 1198.30s |  I refuse to call it X.
1199.30s - 1202.50s |  If you look at the lowest left corner of the post
1202.50s - 1206.34s |  on the left, you will see that the source address is IPFSIO.
1206.34s - 1208.42s |  Somebody's hosting a drainer campaign,
1208.42s - 1211.42s |  a phishing campaign on IPFSIO,
1211.42s - 1215.14s |  rendering it basically immortal, unable to be taken down.
1215.14s - 1218.42s |  So it has, let's see, rent-free web server
1218.42s - 1221.34s |  to host the campaign forever.
1221.34s - 1225.34s |  Those are the dangers of decentralization
1225.34s - 1229.26s |  when it's weaponized.
1229.26s - 1231.86s |  And then, so I hope you enjoyed this talk.
1231.86s - 1233.30s |  It's time to say goodbye.
1233.30s - 1235.62s |  I know that you may have questions.
1235.62s - 1238.38s |  This talk is not exactly about NFTs or blockchain in general.
1238.38s - 1240.10s |  We'd rather hold on abusing it.
1240.10s - 1240.94s |  I hope you enjoyed it.
1240.94s - 1242.46s |  Sorry for the demo not working.
1242.46s - 1244.46s |  I apologize, heartfelt.
1244.46s - 1245.90s |  And well, thanks for coming.
1245.90s - 1247.26s |  Thanks for your time.
1247.26s - 1248.62s |  I really enjoy your company today.
1248.62s - 1253.23s |  You can contact us here.
1253.23s - 1254.23s |  Thank you, everyone.
1254.23s - 1258.35s |  Any questions, comments, or something like this?
1258.35s - 1261.71s |  The doll is not for sale.
1261.71s - 1262.55s |  Did you release the tool?
1262.55s - 1263.71s |  Yeah, the tool is released.
1263.71s - 1267.47s |  You can actually create your own metamask address,
1267.47s - 1270.03s |  jump to OpenSea, and start fiddling with it.
1270.03s - 1272.43s |  Feel free to fork it, change it, your call.
1273.91s - 1274.95s |  Someone else?
1274.95s - 1276.23s |  Questions?
1276.23s - 1277.87s |  Comments?
1277.87s - 1278.71s |  No?
1278.71s - 1281.67s |  So a quick advertisement.
1281.67s - 1284.23s |  We are holding a new village here.
1284.23s - 1285.27s |  It's La Villa Hacker.
1285.27s - 1289.19s |  It's more focused on people who speak Spanish and Portuguese.
1289.19s - 1292.83s |  We have awesome talks, all in Spanish and Portuguese.
1292.83s - 1294.99s |  If you want to visit us, it would be awesome.
1294.99s - 1297.39s |  And thank you very much, guys.
1297.39s - 1298.23s |  Thank you.
