**Introduction and Context**
- Presentation by Eduard Agavriloae and Matei Josephs at DEF CON 32
- Focus on discovering secrets in **public AMIs** (Amazon Machine Images) on AWS
- Examination of the risks associated with **AWS access credentials** exposure through public AMIs

**Objectives and Goals**
- **Research Goals**: Explore secrets in every public AMI across all AWS regions
- **Additional Goals**: Responsible disclosure and potential bounty opportunities

**Methodology**
- **Initial Setup**: Gathering 3.1 million public AMIs using AWS CLI
- **Filtering Process**: Reduced to 26,000 AMIs through various filtering steps such as removing marketplace and trusted publisher AMIs
- **Access Methodology**: Used a workaround involving detaching and reattaching volumes to a "secret searcher" instance for data analysis

**Challenges and Solutions**
- **Tool Limitations**: Initial tools like TruffleHog were slow and generated false positives
- **Pivot to Simplicity**: Adopted **find** utility for searching specific files and directories
- **Automation**: Set up additional automation for verifying AWS credentials and API keys

**Findings**
- Discovered **100,000 potential AWS credentials**, with 120 valid, including 20 root accounts
- Many affected companies are on the Fortune 500 list
- Significant overlap of secrets in **git repositories** and **private keys**

**Responsible Disclosure and Impact**
- **Disclosure Efforts**: Sent 70 responsible disclosure emails, received less than 10 responses
- **AWS Security Team**: Assisted in invalidating over 60 AWS keys
- Highlighted the lack of response and action from many companies on the issue

**Lessons and Recommendations**
- **Security by Obscurity**: Ineffective for protecting sensitive data
- **Public AMIs**: Should not be used for storing sensitive information
- Encourage continuous monitoring of new public AMIs for potential exposure

**Future Research and Collaboration**
- **Further Research**: Potential for continuous monitoring and exploring other cloud resources
- **Collaboration**: Emphasized as crucial for ongoing cybersecurity research and improvement

**Conclusions**
- **Unfinished Impact**: Still more secrets to uncover in the collected data
- **Collaboration Importance**: Encouragement for further research and sharing of insights within the cybersecurity community
