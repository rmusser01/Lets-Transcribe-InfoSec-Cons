 So should we get started? Okay, I guess we're getting started.
3.44s - 8.40s |  So hello, everyone. Welcome to DEF CON at the lovely Las Vegas Convention Center.
8.40s - 10.72s |  A fabulous new venue that we're all learning to deal with.
11.28s - 13.60s |  First off, can folks who are sitting in the back hear me?
13.60s - 16.96s |  Because I know it's a pretty difficult room.
16.96s - 20.32s |  So there's plenty of space up here. Feel free to move forward or whatever.
20.32s - 22.64s |  The screens are also a little tiny if you're sitting in the back.
22.64s - 25.44s |  Trust me, I don't bite and I don't think anyone else here does either.
25.44s - 28.88s |  But what we'll talk about today is getting into the risk and reward
28.88s - 30.88s |  of distributed industrial control systems.
31.60s - 34.32s |  First, who am I? My name is Joe Slowik.
34.32s - 37.12s |  I currently do a bunch of things over at the MITRE Corporation,
37.12s - 39.20s |  like leading up some of the functions within ATT&CK
39.20s - 41.20s |  and doing critical infrastructure research.
41.20s - 44.00s |  And I've done a bunch of things previously, but no one gives a crap about me.
44.00s - 46.24s |  We're here to talk about industrial control systems
46.24s - 50.32s |  and how these things are increasingly interconnected and exposed.
50.32s - 53.92s |  So our agenda is we're going to talk about what distributed operations mean
54.00s - 59.12s |  and how this works to extend the ATT&CK surface of industrial assets.
59.12s - 63.04s |  We'll look at this from the perspective of what opportunities this affords adversaries
63.04s - 65.12s |  and then talk about some risks and considerations
65.12s - 68.48s |  and what we can meaningfully do about this new interconnected,
68.48s - 71.36s |  networked, and exposed landscape that we're dealing with
71.36s - 74.64s |  for fairly important things like critical infrastructure operations.
75.20s - 78.16s |  So first, distributed industrial operations.
78.16s - 79.52s |  What does that actually mean?
80.16s - 83.28s |  Well, if you talk to a lot of people that don't have a whole lot of experience
83.28s - 86.32s |  or have a lot of assumptions around what industrial environments look like,
86.32s - 89.44s |  you would get a picture such as what I hope is up on the screen right now,
89.44s - 90.80s |  because I know there's been some issues,
91.92s - 96.72s |  that there is an error gap that exists segmenting networks quite thoroughly
96.72s - 99.92s |  between a internet-connected environment and a plant environment
99.92s - 102.24s |  which has no external connectivity whatsoever.
102.88s - 107.20s |  That may still be the case in certain areas, like nuclear generation, for example,
107.20s - 110.48s |  but has largely never really been the case in many environments
110.48s - 114.08s |  and certainly isn't the case anymore for the majority of operations that exist.
114.72s - 117.84s |  Instead, we're all living in a networked world right now
117.84s - 121.12s |  where we're increasingly seeing systems that you would normally assume
121.12s - 123.76s |  would be walled off from the rest of the world
123.76s - 127.92s |  are connected and need to be connected to systems
127.92s - 130.96s |  that need to talk to something external to your environment.
130.96s - 133.28s |  There is a measure of internet connectivity involved.
133.28s - 135.04s |  It can be controlled, limited.
135.04s - 138.40s |  You can talk about things like data diodes and other sorts of technologies,
138.40s - 140.80s |  but generally speaking, data needs to get in
140.80s - 142.40s |  and some data is going to need to get out.
143.20s - 145.52s |  In looking at this, in legacy environments,
145.52s - 149.36s |  we're really talking about operations and control are co-located.
149.36s - 151.76s |  One of the things that enabled that error gap to exist
151.76s - 154.16s |  is that you had your operators
154.16s - 155.92s |  and the physical equipment they were dealing with
155.92s - 158.24s |  were co-located at the same physical site
158.24s - 162.48s |  where plant networks stop at the physical boundary of the facility.
162.48s - 164.96s |  You didn't have to worry about networking these things.
164.96s - 166.56s |  However, more modern operations,
166.56s - 168.96s |  if we're talking about things like wind farms,
168.96s - 172.16s |  pipelines, increasingly ambitious mining operations
172.16s - 174.56s |  or offshore oil and gas exploration,
174.56s - 176.72s |  we're really talking about controlling systems
176.72s - 180.00s |  that now extend in geographically dispersed ways
180.00s - 183.76s |  where we have to distribute operations and a lack of manning,
183.76s - 186.16s |  both because it's very difficult to try to staff
186.16s - 188.56s |  every single compressor station along a pipeline
188.56s - 191.92s |  or every single wind farm that exists in western Kansas
191.92s - 193.44s |  or something along those lines,
193.44s - 195.60s |  that we need remote operations control,
195.60s - 197.76s |  monitoring, et cetera, to make these things happen.
197.76s - 200.16s |  So this isn't just a cost-saving mechanism at this point.
200.16s - 203.36s |  It's a necessity based upon how we have built out infrastructure
203.36s - 205.76s |  and how very vital aspects
205.76s - 208.72s |  of the current critical infrastructure mix function.
208.72s - 210.48s |  Now, this isn't especially new.
210.48s - 211.92s |  So those of you who are familiar
211.92s - 214.64s |  with the electric operations and similar,
214.64s - 216.88s |  like, well, we've had energy management systems,
216.88s - 219.12s |  transmission management systems and similar
219.12s - 221.68s |  that have centralized management
221.68s - 224.56s |  to fairly complex and geographically distributed systems
224.56s - 225.76s |  for quite some time
225.76s - 228.40s |  and has operated in a fairly analog fashion
228.40s - 229.92s |  in a number of cases as well.
229.92s - 233.20s |  So even getting outside of digital technologies.
233.20s - 235.68s |  So we've been doing bits of this for quite some time
235.68s - 239.04s |  and do it rather well in certain cases too.
239.04s - 240.40s |  But what we're really looking at now
240.40s - 242.72s |  is a radicalization of how this connectivity works
242.72s - 244.80s |  because now we're getting away from things
244.80s - 248.40s |  like hardline connectivity to all of these assets
248.40s - 251.04s |  or using things like, you know, telephone lines
251.04s - 252.40s |  or buried fiber
252.40s - 254.96s |  and getting into an increasingly wireless ecosystem
254.96s - 256.88s |  to facilitate this communication
256.88s - 258.48s |  where we're relying upon things
258.48s - 261.44s |  like satellite communications, 5G, 4G networks,
261.44s - 263.12s |  and similar to make this happen,
263.12s - 265.84s |  which introduced some interesting security repercussions
265.84s - 267.84s |  to how this communication is taking place.
268.88s - 270.48s |  So what we're looking at is that, yes,
270.48s - 272.72s |  we've done some of this remote management historically,
272.72s - 274.80s |  but now we're doing it in a much more prevalent
274.80s - 277.76s |  and in a much more potentially insecure
277.76s - 280.64s |  or attack surface magnifying way
280.64s - 282.16s |  where economics, efficiency,
282.16s - 283.76s |  and just the way that we operate
283.76s - 286.00s |  have driven unmanned and remote operations
286.00s - 287.60s |  in a number of sectors.
287.60s - 289.04s |  Technology advances, however,
289.04s - 292.00s |  are permitting easier connectivity with remote assets.
292.00s - 294.88s |  Having a classic VSAT, very small arpiture terminal,
294.88s - 297.20s |  10 or 20 years ago for a remote mining site
297.20s - 299.44s |  is like trying to suck a grape through a straw
299.44s - 301.52s |  when it comes to bandwidth and connectivity,
301.52s - 305.04s |  whereas now advances in technology,
305.04s - 307.52s |  the expansion of satellite constellations and so forth
307.52s - 309.92s |  have dramatically increased the bandwidth available
309.92s - 311.60s |  for these types of networks
311.60s - 314.72s |  and expanded the scope of what we reasonably expect to do
314.72s - 316.72s |  with these sorts of control systems.
316.72s - 318.24s |  And furthermore, industry trends
318.24s - 320.00s |  like distributed energy resources,
320.00s - 322.24s |  as well as things like vendor remote telemetry
322.24s - 324.96s |  and remote preventative maintenance and so forth
324.96s - 327.60s |  are accelerating these trends by requiring
327.60s - 330.64s |  that asset owners increasingly allow for connectivity
330.64s - 332.24s |  to their industrial assets.
332.24s - 334.72s |  So now we're getting into things like having assets
334.72s - 336.96s |  or at least elements of assets connected to,
336.96s - 339.76s |  if not residing in cloud-based instances
339.76s - 342.08s |  which dramatically changes
342.08s - 345.28s |  what the ideas of segmentation look like
345.28s - 347.20s |  in terms of how these environments can operate.
347.84s - 350.40s |  So in looking at our options for remote connectivity,
350.40s - 352.16s |  we certainly have some traditional items
352.16s - 355.04s |  that are out there like our plain old telephone system,
355.04s - 356.08s |  dedicated fiber,
356.08s - 359.92s |  or fairly uncontroversial and historical in nature.
359.92s - 361.68s |  But now we're really talking about expanding
361.68s - 362.88s |  the use of cellular modems,
362.88s - 364.72s |  which have also been around for quite some time,
365.28s - 368.40s |  getting into increased adoption of satellite systems
368.40s - 371.36s |  for enabling these systems to talk to one another
371.36s - 374.64s |  and using a variety of 5G and wireless technologies
374.64s - 376.80s |  to facilitate this sort of communication.
377.92s - 378.88s |  So what does this mean?
378.88s - 381.68s |  Well, it has lots of operational elements to it
381.68s - 385.12s |  in terms of how industrial asset management,
385.12s - 387.04s |  monitoring and control function,
387.04s - 388.72s |  but also adversaries are involved
388.72s - 390.24s |  in these conversations as well,
390.24s - 392.80s |  because we're also talking about dramatic changes
392.80s - 394.64s |  to what the attack surface looks like
394.64s - 396.64s |  for these types of resources.
396.64s - 399.60s |  So when looking at always online industrial systems,
399.60s - 401.36s |  we're really expanding scope out
401.36s - 402.48s |  so that if we're talking about
402.48s - 404.96s |  a distributed satellite communication network,
404.96s - 407.84s |  where you have communications bouncing to an overhead asset
407.84s - 410.08s |  and then going to a ground communication center,
410.08s - 412.80s |  that you have a variety of wired and wireless links
412.80s - 415.52s |  that become involved in connecting various assets up
415.52s - 417.36s |  and multiple potential touch points
417.36s - 419.36s |  to get into and interact with that network.
420.00s - 422.00s |  Similarly, for 5G or other sorts
422.00s - 423.76s |  of wireless terrestrial networks,
423.76s - 426.32s |  we're talking about mesh networks of multiple devices
426.32s - 427.92s |  that can talk to one another
427.92s - 429.68s |  and communicate in a variety of ways
429.68s - 432.32s |  that introduce a very interesting landscape
432.32s - 434.00s |  in terms of who can talk to whom
434.00s - 435.60s |  and how you control the directionality
435.60s - 437.04s |  of such communication.
437.04s - 438.80s |  But also we're talking about systems
438.80s - 441.20s |  where we're rapidly integrating vendors
441.20s - 443.04s |  being able to consistently monitor
443.04s - 444.72s |  and potentially even interact
444.72s - 446.32s |  with their environments as well,
446.32s - 449.20s |  such as the GE Atlanta data highway
449.20s - 456.16s |  for managing generating assets produced by that company.
456.16s - 458.16s |  We're seeing this across a variety of vendors
458.16s - 461.68s |  where you have assets tied to vendor management
461.68s - 463.68s |  and monitoring for preventative maintenance,
463.68s - 466.72s |  remote management, and just big data analytics
466.72s - 468.56s |  and so forth to fuel product development
468.56s - 469.52s |  and product support.
470.32s - 472.80s |  So in looking at these connectivity functions
472.80s - 473.68s |  and dependencies,
473.68s - 475.12s |  there's certainly the remote access
475.12s - 476.80s |  and maintenance aspect of things
476.80s - 478.80s |  of how do you operate power plants
478.80s - 481.52s |  that are spread out over a wide geographic area
481.52s - 483.84s |  and control them in a way that makes sense,
483.84s - 486.16s |  that remote control and operations aspect,
486.16s - 488.24s |  but also the telemetry and health check aspect
488.24s - 489.68s |  of how do I make sure things are running
489.68s - 491.44s |  and running as I want them to,
492.00s - 494.16s |  but also getting into very commercial aspects
494.16s - 496.08s |  like licensing and use monitoring.
496.08s - 498.00s |  Are you operating your equipment
498.00s - 500.00s |  in line with the contract that you signed
500.00s - 501.68s |  and using it within the boundaries
501.68s - 503.76s |  of what it is that we agreed to commercially?
504.32s - 506.72s |  And finally, we get system of system items as well,
506.72s - 508.24s |  such as coordination, balancing,
508.24s - 510.32s |  and management of wider scope systems,
510.32s - 511.52s |  whether we're talking about things
511.52s - 513.76s |  like maintaining frequency phase, et cetera,
513.76s - 515.52s |  for the overall electric system
515.52s - 517.20s |  or managing pipelines to ensure
517.20s - 518.64s |  that they're adequately pressurized
518.64s - 519.92s |  along their entire length
519.92s - 521.36s |  to allow for product delivery
522.00s - 523.20s |  across their entire network.
523.92s - 525.12s |  So what this means is that
525.12s - 526.48s |  as we've started expanding
526.48s - 527.84s |  these sorts of functionalities
527.84s - 530.16s |  and exposing these items through wireless
530.16s - 531.20s |  and other means,
531.20s - 532.64s |  it's providing opportunities
532.64s - 534.48s |  for adversaries to interact
534.48s - 535.68s |  with these elements in ways
535.68s - 537.92s |  that didn't really exist previously.
537.92s - 539.04s |  So what does that look like?
540.00s - 541.04s |  Well, what it looks like
541.04s - 542.32s |  is that we have distributed
542.32s - 543.52s |  overlapping communications
543.52s - 545.76s |  that are really good for efficient,
546.56s - 547.60s |  reasonably reliable
547.60s - 548.64s |  if there are fail-safes
548.64s - 549.92s |  and backups involved
549.92s - 551.28s |  in how these are put together.
551.28s - 552.16s |  But in doing so,
552.16s - 554.08s |  we've also expanded the attack surface
554.08s - 555.20s |  in such a manner
555.20s - 557.68s |  that it's no longer about accessing
557.68s - 560.32s |  the external facing IT
560.32s - 562.40s |  or classic business network assets
562.40s - 564.88s |  of an industrial asset owner and operator,
564.88s - 565.76s |  and then digging your way
565.76s - 566.40s |  through the network
566.40s - 568.48s |  to get into the industrial environment
568.48s - 570.32s |  through several lateral movement hops
570.32s - 571.28s |  and so forth.
571.28s - 572.40s |  But instead, I may be able
572.40s - 573.92s |  to hit those assets directly
573.92s - 575.12s |  either through a wireless
575.12s - 576.56s |  communication mechanism
576.56s - 577.60s |  or because the way
577.60s - 578.56s |  in which these assets
578.56s - 580.16s |  are networked overall
580.16s - 581.68s |  allows me to access the provider
581.68s - 582.64s |  in such a way
582.64s - 583.44s |  that I can now start
583.44s - 584.48s |  delivering payloads
584.48s - 586.64s |  directly to the critical assets
586.64s - 587.60s |  within the environment
587.60s - 589.28s |  or at least the networking assets
589.28s - 590.64s |  that are facilitating
590.64s - 592.40s |  the connectivity of those assets
592.40s - 593.52s |  to the wider environment.
593.52s - 594.72s |  And we're going to look at an example
594.72s - 596.16s |  of that here in just one slide.
597.60s - 598.24s |  But the thing is,
598.24s - 599.20s |  is that we're really talking
599.20s - 600.72s |  about expanding the opportunities
600.72s - 602.40s |  of adversaries to interact
602.40s - 604.16s |  via these new communication mechanisms
604.16s - 605.76s |  in a distributed environment
605.76s - 607.36s |  that increases the opportunities
607.36s - 610.16s |  for adversaries to interfere with,
610.16s - 612.16s |  inject into, or otherwise
612.80s - 614.16s |  send commands to
614.16s - 615.28s |  these sorts of assets
615.28s - 617.60s |  for a variety of potential reasons.
617.60s - 619.36s |  So what does this look like in practice?
620.08s - 620.88s |  Well, we have one
620.88s - 622.00s |  really interesting example
622.00s - 623.28s |  from a couple of years ago.
623.28s - 624.24s |  For those who were following
624.24s - 625.20s |  the news at the time
625.20s - 626.00s |  at the very start
626.00s - 626.80s |  of the current phase
626.80s - 628.80s |  of Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
628.80s - 630.88s |  there was a interruption
630.88s - 633.04s |  to the KASAT network
633.04s - 634.16s |  owned by Viasat,
634.16s - 635.52s |  managed by a subsidiary,
635.52s - 637.28s |  by a contracting entity
637.28s - 638.40s |  that resulted not just
638.40s - 639.84s |  in a disruption of communication
639.84s - 642.32s |  for Ukrainian military operations
642.32s - 644.64s |  that was using the KASAT network,
644.64s - 645.60s |  but also resulted
645.60s - 646.80s |  in a significant outage
646.80s - 648.80s |  for wind turbines manufactured
648.80s - 651.12s |  by a German company called Enercon,
651.12s - 652.88s |  where essentially a loss of view
652.88s - 654.88s |  and debatably a loss of control
655.68s - 657.28s |  situation manifested
657.28s - 659.44s |  because the terminals,
659.44s - 661.04s |  the modems that were being used
661.04s - 662.80s |  to connect these wind farm systems
662.80s - 663.76s |  to remote control
663.76s - 665.04s |  and management systems
665.04s - 667.36s |  were bricked by a family of malware
667.36s - 669.20s |  labeled by Sentinel-1 researchers
669.20s - 670.00s |  as acid rain.
670.56s - 672.24s |  While it was not intentional,
672.24s - 673.44s |  or we at least do not think
673.44s - 674.48s |  that it was intentional
674.48s - 675.60s |  in this event,
675.60s - 677.92s |  that taking out this wind generation
677.92s - 679.20s |  was purposeful,
679.20s - 681.68s |  still in attacking the KASAT network
681.68s - 683.60s |  through the delivery,
683.60s - 684.64s |  the push of basically
684.64s - 686.72s |  a malicious software payload
686.72s - 687.92s |  to customer terminals
687.92s - 689.60s |  within the overall environment,
689.60s - 691.36s |  they were able to knock offline
691.36s - 692.96s |  a variety of generating assets.
692.96s - 694.56s |  Now, certainly if you're talking
694.56s - 697.20s |  about remote wind and et cetera,
697.20s - 698.24s |  there are fail-safes
698.24s - 699.20s |  that step into play
699.20s - 700.48s |  in order to cause these things
700.48s - 702.56s |  to at least fail safely,
702.56s - 704.32s |  fail relatively securely,
704.32s - 705.28s |  but we're still talking
705.28s - 706.48s |  about placing these assets
706.48s - 707.60s |  into a state
707.60s - 708.40s |  where they're no longer
708.40s - 709.92s |  able to sync effectively
709.92s - 711.60s |  with the broader environment
711.60s - 712.48s |  and no longer able
712.48s - 714.08s |  to effectively manage them
714.08s - 716.16s |  as we would if that connectivity existed
716.16s - 717.76s |  as it was intended to do so.
717.76s - 718.88s |  So certainly putting
718.88s - 720.16s |  a fairly interesting element
720.16s - 722.24s |  and an increasingly important element
722.24s - 724.16s |  of our generating mix at risk
724.16s - 725.60s |  when we start talking about things
725.60s - 726.88s |  like distributed wind,
726.88s - 727.84s |  distributed solar,
728.40s - 729.84s |  and even getting into things
729.84s - 731.36s |  like rooftop solar, et cetera,
731.36s - 732.80s |  which may rely upon
732.80s - 734.32s |  wireless communication mechanisms
734.32s - 737.28s |  and the use of various networking devices
737.28s - 737.92s |  and so forth
737.92s - 739.60s |  that have vulnerabilities in them
739.60s - 740.80s |  or have the possibility
740.80s - 742.64s |  of a acid rain-like scenario
742.64s - 743.52s |  where we could potentially
743.52s - 745.04s |  push a malicious payload
745.04s - 746.88s |  via access to some other element
746.88s - 748.24s |  within the overall network
748.24s - 749.76s |  to cause widespread impacts
749.76s - 750.96s |  and outages across
750.96s - 752.24s |  all the interlinked devices.
753.92s - 755.68s |  We also have the Colonial Pipeline incident.
755.68s - 756.88s |  I put an asterisk on this
756.88s - 759.20s |  because this really was more
759.20s - 760.32s |  of a proof of concept
760.32s - 761.84s |  in terms of what may have occurred
761.84s - 763.60s |  as opposed to what actually occurred.
763.60s - 764.96s |  So for Colonial Pipeline,
765.84s - 766.96s |  Colonial Pipeline basically
766.96s - 768.40s |  shut their own operations down
768.40s - 770.32s |  because they lacked the visibility
770.32s - 771.44s |  and the confidence
771.44s - 772.56s |  in saying that they were able
772.56s - 774.40s |  to run a effective network
775.20s - 776.32s |  that could be ran safe,
776.32s - 777.44s |  but also could track things
777.44s - 778.72s |  like product delivery
778.72s - 780.72s |  as a result of a ransomware incident.
780.72s - 782.64s |  But out of the Colonial Pipeline event,
782.64s - 784.80s |  you saw a number of commentators,
784.80s - 788.32s |  I'll use that word pejoratively,
788.32s - 789.52s |  that asked questions about,
789.52s - 790.96s |  well, why not just air gap everything?
790.96s - 792.96s |  It's like, it's a couple thousand mile pipeline.
792.96s - 793.92s |  It's only got like seven
793.92s - 795.04s |  or eight compressor stations
795.04s - 796.80s |  and maybe a dozen PLCs, right?
796.80s - 797.60s |  How hard could that be
797.60s - 798.56s |  to network all that together
798.56s - 800.80s |  with buried fiber?
800.80s - 801.52s |  The answer to that
801.52s - 802.56s |  is that it's not easy.
802.56s - 803.84s |  And while Colonial Pipeline
803.84s - 805.60s |  resulted from an impact
805.60s - 806.80s |  on the business network,
806.80s - 807.84s |  it doesn't take a whole lot
807.84s - 809.44s |  to expand our conception
809.44s - 810.64s |  of what a pipeline incident
810.64s - 811.60s |  might look like
811.60s - 813.44s |  to being able to interact
813.44s - 814.64s |  with compressor stations
814.64s - 816.40s |  that are remote, often unmanned,
817.36s - 818.56s |  and relying upon
818.56s - 820.32s |  increasingly wireless communications,
820.32s - 821.36s |  although there are still
821.36s - 823.28s |  hardwired communications in play,
823.28s - 824.40s |  to allow for interaction
824.40s - 825.76s |  with how that pipeline functions
825.76s - 826.96s |  to induce conditions
826.96s - 828.16s |  like a loss of view
828.16s - 829.20s |  because you're no longer able
829.20s - 829.84s |  to communicate
829.84s - 831.76s |  with a specific compressor station.
831.76s - 832.96s |  Depending on how things work,
832.96s - 833.76s |  and this gets a little bit
833.76s - 835.28s |  more interesting
835.28s - 836.56s |  in terms of what possibilities
836.56s - 837.52s |  are available,
837.52s - 838.00s |  you could,
838.00s - 839.12s |  with sufficient access
839.12s - 840.80s |  and poor segmentation
840.80s - 841.76s |  and so forth,
841.76s - 843.12s |  be able to inject controls
843.12s - 844.24s |  into a legitimate way
844.24s - 845.44s |  of operating and maintaining
845.44s - 846.48s |  that pipeline
846.48s - 848.00s |  to start inducing potential
848.00s - 848.96s |  catastrophic events
848.96s - 849.76s |  like an overpressure
849.76s - 851.44s |  or underpressure situation
851.44s - 852.08s |  that would result
852.08s - 853.20s |  in pipeline disruption.
853.84s - 855.04s |  Not really easy,
855.04s - 856.08s |  and it's debatable
856.08s - 857.20s |  how practical that would be
857.20s - 858.64s |  for an adversary to do.
858.64s - 859.76s |  But if we're exposing
859.76s - 861.12s |  control systems that relate
861.12s - 862.40s |  to the fundamental operation
862.40s - 863.36s |  of these assets,
863.36s - 864.64s |  and especially if those controls
864.64s - 866.16s |  are going over the air
866.16s - 867.44s |  in an unencrypted way
867.44s - 868.80s |  that aren't using proper check sums
868.80s - 869.68s |  to validate commands
869.68s - 870.80s |  and controls that are going
870.80s - 871.92s |  over that environment,
871.92s - 873.84s |  the possibilities for replaying,
873.84s - 874.72s |  capturing,
874.72s - 876.16s |  or potentially modifying
876.16s - 877.52s |  control system logic
877.52s - 879.36s |  as it moves over unsecure lines
879.36s - 880.40s |  or over the air
880.40s - 881.04s |  starts becoming
881.04s - 882.32s |  a very interesting scenario
882.32s - 883.84s |  for how to achieve
883.84s - 885.04s |  far more lasting
885.04s - 886.24s |  and concerning effects
886.24s - 886.96s |  than what we saw
886.96s - 888.08s |  with the ransomware incident
888.08s - 888.88s |  a few years ago.
890.32s - 891.60s |  In looking overall at this,
891.60s - 892.88s |  we see that there's a variety
892.88s - 894.08s |  of diverse opportunities
894.08s - 896.08s |  that are available for adversaries
896.08s - 897.60s |  in terms of their ability
897.60s - 900.08s |  to control or to interact
900.08s - 902.56s |  with critical infrastructure elements
902.56s - 904.64s |  enabled by an increasingly
904.64s - 905.44s |  remote perspective
905.44s - 906.24s |  on how these systems
906.24s - 908.48s |  are managed and maintained.
908.48s - 909.12s |  So certainly,
909.12s - 910.40s |  there are IT-focused
910.40s - 912.16s |  disruption mechanisms
912.16s - 912.88s |  that can take place
912.88s - 914.16s |  against control centers,
914.16s - 915.28s |  which can be very interesting
915.28s - 916.80s |  because rather than having,
916.80s - 918.32s |  say, control centers distributed
918.32s - 919.68s |  among various assets,
919.68s - 922.08s |  now I have one centralized control
922.08s - 923.04s |  and management station
923.04s - 924.32s |  sitting in Spain,
924.32s - 925.68s |  if I'm Siemens Gamesa
925.68s - 926.80s |  or something like that,
926.80s - 928.80s |  or one centralized control station
929.52s - 930.48s |  located elsewhere
930.48s - 931.60s |  that the vendor is managing
931.60s - 933.04s |  in order to maintain a wind farm
933.04s - 934.64s |  or a fleet of wind farms,
934.64s - 935.84s |  then if that gets taken out
935.84s - 936.88s |  through ransomware,
936.88s - 937.68s |  something deliberate
937.68s - 938.72s |  and more malicious,
938.72s - 939.52s |  et cetera,
939.52s - 940.64s |  can I still operate
940.64s - 941.52s |  all those facilities
941.52s - 943.20s |  in a safe and effective manner
943.20s - 944.32s |  that allows for them
944.32s - 945.20s |  to continue to be part
945.20s - 946.88s |  of the overall energy mix?
946.96s - 950.32s |  But also we have more end state
950.32s - 952.64s |  or field device
952.64s - 953.76s |  potential scenarios
953.76s - 955.12s |  that come from subversion
955.12s - 956.56s |  or injection into
956.56s - 958.40s |  these communication environments.
958.40s - 959.28s |  So here we're talking
959.28s - 960.40s |  about possibilities like,
960.40s - 962.96s |  well, looking at the intercom scenario
962.96s - 965.36s |  where I can specifically
965.36s - 966.72s |  and deliberately take out
966.72s - 968.08s |  the communication devices
968.08s - 969.60s |  that tie these systems
969.60s - 971.20s |  back into centralized
971.20s - 973.52s |  monitoring and control,
973.52s - 975.52s |  or like a theoretical
975.52s - 977.20s |  pipeline attack scenario,
977.20s - 978.88s |  leverage my ability to inject
978.88s - 981.12s |  into insecure communication streams
981.12s - 982.88s |  to send rogue commands,
982.88s - 983.84s |  similar to what we see.
983.84s - 985.20s |  Ooh, there's a microphone.
985.76s - 986.72s |  Similar to what we see
986.72s - 988.48s |  like the using of a tool
988.48s - 989.92s |  like Frosty Goop,
989.92s - 990.72s |  which was in the news
990.72s - 991.76s |  a few weeks ago
991.76s - 992.80s |  in terms of injecting
993.60s - 995.20s |  Modbus communication logic
995.20s - 996.08s |  in order to have effects
996.08s - 997.76s |  on central heating in Ukraine.
997.76s - 998.56s |  But something like that
998.56s - 999.68s |  taking place without having
999.68s - 1001.68s |  the IT intrusion,
1001.68s - 1002.72s |  but rather based off
1002.72s - 1004.16s |  of the ability to interact
1004.16s - 1005.44s |  directly with control systems
1005.68s - 1007.52s |  over a wireless communication link
1007.52s - 1008.32s |  that doesn't involve
1008.32s - 1009.92s |  breaching another aspect
1009.92s - 1012.24s |  of the asset owner's network
1012.24s - 1013.52s |  or may involve breaching
1013.52s - 1015.04s |  the contracting entity
1015.04s - 1015.60s |  that's providing
1015.60s - 1017.36s |  that communication infrastructure
1017.36s - 1018.48s |  in order to then deliver
1018.48s - 1020.80s |  that follow-on effect
1020.80s - 1022.72s |  to the actual industrial assets
1022.72s - 1023.52s |  that are interesting.
1024.08s - 1025.52s |  Either way, we look at these
1025.52s - 1027.76s |  two different sides of the equation
1027.76s - 1029.36s |  between going after
1029.36s - 1030.56s |  the centralized control
1030.56s - 1031.20s |  and management,
1031.20s - 1032.40s |  the single points of failure
1032.40s - 1033.12s |  for how these networks
1033.12s - 1034.56s |  are operated in many ways,
1034.56s - 1035.60s |  which is why there are
1035.60s - 1036.88s |  typically very well secured.
1036.88s - 1037.60s |  If you've gone to
1037.60s - 1039.76s |  an electric utilities EMS
1039.76s - 1042.00s |  or transmission management system
1042.00s - 1043.52s |  where it's physically located,
1043.52s - 1044.40s |  there is significant
1044.40s - 1045.28s |  physical security.
1045.28s - 1046.56s |  These are crown jewel assets
1046.56s - 1047.92s |  for IT security.
1047.92s - 1050.32s |  They're not exactly poorly defended,
1050.32s - 1051.52s |  but if we start talking
1051.52s - 1052.64s |  one layer up
1052.64s - 1054.00s |  from the actual
1054.00s - 1055.04s |  management and maintenance
1055.04s - 1056.24s |  that if you can't get commands
1056.24s - 1057.28s |  out from that center,
1057.28s - 1058.64s |  from those consoles,
1058.64s - 1060.40s |  out to the devices in the field
1060.40s - 1061.84s |  that you're trying to maintain
1061.84s - 1062.72s |  and manage,
1062.72s - 1064.16s |  things can go south very quickly
1064.16s - 1065.28s |  and result in systems
1065.28s - 1066.64s |  that if they don't have
1066.64s - 1067.68s |  the proper resilience
1067.68s - 1069.76s |  and failovers in place,
1069.76s - 1071.68s |  can start entering
1071.68s - 1072.88s |  into very unsafe
1072.88s - 1074.48s |  and uncertain states fairly quickly.
1075.52s - 1078.16s |  In looking at these considerations,
1078.16s - 1079.92s |  the main worry that I have, at least,
1079.92s - 1081.44s |  and that we're starting to see
1081.44s - 1083.68s |  in some of these technologies
1083.68s - 1085.04s |  and implementations
1085.04s - 1087.28s |  is that in the drive for efficiency,
1087.28s - 1088.16s |  oh, we could use
1088.16s - 1090.08s |  the Starlink constellation
1090.08s - 1092.48s |  and just put little satellite receivers
1092.48s - 1094.08s |  or whatever at all of our end stations
1094.56s - 1095.44s |  and we have connectivity
1095.44s - 1097.28s |  for relatively low cost
1097.28s - 1098.40s |  with fairly good bandwidth
1098.40s - 1098.88s |  that we can tie
1098.88s - 1100.56s |  all these items together.
1100.56s - 1101.20s |  That's true,
1101.20s - 1102.40s |  but if that constellation
1102.40s - 1103.28s |  should go down
1103.28s - 1105.12s |  or if there is a malicious update
1105.12s - 1107.04s |  that's pushed to Starlink terminals
1107.04s - 1109.28s |  or some other scenario manifests,
1109.28s - 1110.32s |  how do we then ensure
1110.32s - 1111.04s |  that that system
1111.04s - 1112.80s |  can retain operational
1112.80s - 1113.76s |  and how long do we have
1113.76s - 1115.20s |  until that system needs to switch
1115.20s - 1116.88s |  into an emergency state
1116.88s - 1118.16s |  to ensure the continued
1118.16s - 1119.52s |  viable operation
1119.52s - 1121.12s |  of critical infrastructure assets
1121.12s - 1122.72s |  like electricity generation,
1122.80s - 1123.92s |  pipeline operations,
1124.48s - 1125.92s |  remote mining operations,
1126.64s - 1128.32s |  offshore oil and gas exploration
1128.32s - 1129.76s |  and drilling, et cetera.
1129.76s - 1130.88s |  So the result is that
1130.88s - 1132.08s |  the possibilities emerge
1132.08s - 1135.04s |  for severing or degrading
1135.04s - 1136.48s |  active control mechanisms
1136.48s - 1137.92s |  in these sorts of environments
1137.92s - 1138.56s |  that can place
1138.56s - 1140.24s |  these ecosystems at risk.
1140.24s - 1141.76s |  This gets us into a situation
1141.76s - 1142.64s |  where if you're familiar
1142.64s - 1144.00s |  with ICS for ATT&CK,
1144.00s - 1146.16s |  the framework for mapping out
1146.16s - 1147.76s |  potential adversary opportunities
1147.76s - 1150.32s |  for interacting with industrial assets,
1150.32s - 1151.36s |  that we can start seeing
1151.36s - 1152.48s |  the possibilities emerge
1152.48s - 1154.00s |  for inducing a loss of view,
1154.00s - 1155.60s |  the ability to monitor
1155.60s - 1157.28s |  and extract information
1157.28s - 1158.24s |  from these environments
1158.24s - 1159.36s |  for the purpose of determining
1159.36s - 1160.40s |  are they operating in the way
1160.40s - 1161.76s |  that we want them to
1161.76s - 1165.04s |  and are they doing their job
1165.04s - 1166.64s |  safely, efficiently, et cetera,
1166.64s - 1167.60s |  but also potentially
1167.60s - 1168.40s |  and more worryingly,
1168.40s - 1169.76s |  a loss of control
1169.76s - 1171.12s |  where we get into a scenario,
1171.12s - 1172.72s |  not whether I can start a process,
1172.72s - 1174.32s |  but rather can I stop it
1174.32s - 1176.16s |  if that process starts deviating
1176.16s - 1179.76s |  from safe or desirable parameters
1179.76s - 1181.12s |  for its overall functionality.
1181.92s - 1182.96s |  So in looking at this,
1182.96s - 1184.64s |  what risks are we talking about
1184.64s - 1185.76s |  and what considerations
1185.76s - 1187.36s |  are involved in this discussion?
1187.92s - 1190.08s |  Well, first, we could make the argument,
1190.08s - 1191.44s |  well, why not just turn back the clock?
1191.44s - 1192.96s |  And I've seen people say this,
1193.76s - 1194.72s |  why not just air gap
1194.72s - 1196.48s |  all the important control systems?
1196.48s - 1198.72s |  Well, that'd be really hard,
1198.72s - 1199.44s |  really expensive.
1199.44s - 1201.04s |  And I don't think anyone really expects
1201.04s - 1202.00s |  that we could realistically
1202.00s - 1202.88s |  do this at this point.
1203.52s - 1204.56s |  That ship has sailed
1204.56s - 1205.60s |  and it probably sailed
1205.60s - 1207.52s |  a very, very long time ago.
1207.52s - 1208.56s |  And looking at things
1208.56s - 1210.00s |  like the type of energy mix
1210.00s - 1211.60s |  that we need for the future,
1211.60s - 1213.60s |  as well as increasingly ambitious things
1213.60s - 1215.12s |  like oil and gas exploration
1215.12s - 1216.72s |  and mining operations,
1216.72s - 1218.48s |  we're going to need these sorts of
1219.76s - 1221.52s |  non-wired over-the-air
1221.52s - 1223.68s |  and distributed communication environments
1223.68s - 1224.80s |  to tie all these assets
1224.80s - 1227.68s |  into centralized data retrieval,
1227.68s - 1229.84s |  monitoring, maintenance and control
1229.84s - 1231.28s |  in order for them to be effective.
1231.28s - 1233.36s |  So we're not able to turn back the clock.
1233.36s - 1234.08s |  We can't just say,
1234.08s - 1235.28s |  why are all the things together,
1236.48s - 1238.80s |  bury 7,000 kilometers worth
1238.80s - 1239.68s |  of dedicated fiber
1239.68s - 1241.36s |  to tie all these things together
1241.36s - 1242.72s |  is just not a realistic option
1242.72s - 1243.36s |  at this point,
1243.36s - 1244.32s |  unless everyone's willing
1244.32s - 1245.44s |  to pay a lot more
1245.44s - 1246.96s |  for a lot of these services
1246.96s - 1248.64s |  that are enabled
1248.64s - 1250.64s |  by the various infrastructure sectors.
1251.44s - 1253.36s |  So instead, we need to acknowledge reality
1253.36s - 1254.48s |  that remote connectivity
1254.48s - 1255.68s |  and especially management
1255.68s - 1257.12s |  of critical assets
1257.12s - 1259.68s |  is a fact of existence right now.
1259.68s - 1260.72s |  However, in doing so,
1260.72s - 1261.28s |  that doesn't mean that
1261.28s - 1262.56s |  we just need to throw our hands up
1262.56s - 1264.56s |  and say, well, OK, I accept the risk
1264.56s - 1266.00s |  and bad things are going to happen.
1266.00s - 1267.52s |  There are ways that we can
1267.52s - 1269.60s |  and must do these sorts of items
1269.60s - 1270.64s |  safely, securely,
1270.64s - 1272.08s |  but also redundantly
1272.08s - 1273.28s |  to ensure that we have
1273.28s - 1276.48s |  the sort of resiliency built in
1276.48s - 1278.48s |  to allow these operations to continue.
1279.76s - 1280.96s |  So in a very simplified way,
1280.96s - 1282.08s |  we can break this down
1282.08s - 1283.92s |  in terms of OT remote operations
1283.92s - 1285.92s |  between security considerations
1285.92s - 1287.92s |  and reliability considerations.
1287.92s - 1289.36s |  From a security standpoint,
1289.36s - 1290.40s |  you know, availability,
1290.40s - 1292.64s |  if we talk our classic confidentiality,
1292.64s - 1294.48s |  integrity, availability triad,
1294.48s - 1295.36s |  we're not going to really worry
1295.36s - 1296.48s |  about availability right now.
1296.48s - 1297.76s |  We're going to assume availability
1297.76s - 1298.48s |  has to be there
1298.48s - 1299.92s |  and we're going to work our damnedest
1299.92s - 1301.28s |  to ensure it.
1301.28s - 1302.96s |  And that is where reliability
1302.96s - 1304.08s |  comes into play.
1304.08s - 1304.96s |  But for ComSec
1304.96s - 1307.20s |  or communication security considerations,
1307.20s - 1308.16s |  we're really talking about
1308.16s - 1309.20s |  ensuring the integrity
1309.20s - 1310.16s |  of those communications,
1310.72s - 1312.00s |  which can be as simple as
1312.00s - 1312.96s |  ensuring that we're doing
1312.96s - 1315.20s |  a robust checksums
1315.20s - 1316.88s |  applied to controls
1316.88s - 1317.92s |  that are communicated
1317.92s - 1319.12s |  over insecure networks.
1319.76s - 1320.56s |  You know, if we're talking about
1320.56s - 1321.68s |  a satellite downlink
1321.68s - 1323.44s |  or wireless communications,
1323.44s - 1324.40s |  some of these links,
1324.40s - 1325.84s |  as you can probably tell
1325.84s - 1326.88s |  from other talks
1326.88s - 1327.68s |  that have taken place
1327.68s - 1329.68s |  at DEF CON's past and present,
1329.68s - 1331.36s |  have emphasized the insecurity
1331.36s - 1332.16s |  of some of these links
1332.16s - 1332.72s |  and how they can be
1332.72s - 1334.08s |  both eavesdropped upon
1334.08s - 1335.04s |  as well as potentially
1335.04s - 1336.00s |  injected into
1336.00s - 1336.96s |  or otherwise subverted
1336.96s - 1338.32s |  for malicious purposes.
1338.32s - 1340.08s |  So being able to verify
1340.08s - 1341.44s |  the integrity of commands
1341.44s - 1342.56s |  that are sent over these links
1342.56s - 1343.52s |  is vital and something
1343.52s - 1345.04s |  that we need to start pursuing
1345.04s - 1346.72s |  or layering on top of
1346.72s - 1349.36s |  existing industrial control protocols
1349.36s - 1351.44s |  and similar to make that happen.
1351.44s - 1353.52s |  Confidentiality may be part of this.
1353.52s - 1354.16s |  You could argue,
1354.16s - 1355.20s |  well, why not just encrypt
1355.20s - 1356.32s |  all of these items?
1356.32s - 1357.52s |  That might work.
1357.52s - 1359.20s |  There is debate as to how useful
1359.20s - 1360.40s |  or how effective that would be
1360.40s - 1362.56s |  because encryption adds overhead
1362.56s - 1363.60s |  and potential latency
1363.60s - 1365.36s |  in terms of how these commands
1365.36s - 1366.48s |  get passed and processed.
1366.48s - 1367.84s |  And as we start talking about
1367.84s - 1368.80s |  pretty thin pipes
1368.80s - 1370.00s |  like remote satellite
1370.00s - 1371.44s |  communication links and so forth
1372.16s - 1373.52s |  and potential latency issues
1373.52s - 1374.32s |  that surround that,
1374.32s - 1375.84s |  it might not be desirable.
1375.84s - 1376.88s |  But it is something that,
1376.88s - 1378.40s |  especially when it comes to
1378.40s - 1380.64s |  OT or ICS related protocols,
1380.64s - 1381.68s |  that needs to be considered
1381.68s - 1382.72s |  more strongly instead of
1382.72s - 1383.68s |  just throwing up our hands
1383.68s - 1384.72s |  in the air and saying,
1384.72s - 1385.44s |  well, this is hard,
1385.44s - 1386.32s |  so let's not do it.
1387.04s - 1388.88s |  From a reliability standpoint,
1388.88s - 1390.08s |  yes, it is cheap and easy
1390.08s - 1391.44s |  just to try to wire things together
1391.44s - 1392.72s |  with commercial satellite modems
1392.72s - 1394.16s |  and so forth and call it good.
1394.16s - 1394.88s |  But if we're talking
1394.88s - 1395.92s |  about critical assets
1395.92s - 1397.36s |  that feed into national
1397.36s - 1398.88s |  critical infrastructure,
1398.88s - 1400.40s |  we need to have something more
1400.40s - 1402.32s |  or build in the correct ways
1402.32s - 1403.68s |  of ensuring those operations
1403.68s - 1404.48s |  can be sustained
1404.48s - 1405.92s |  in a challenging environment,
1405.92s - 1406.80s |  whether that be because
1406.80s - 1407.92s |  a satellite constellation
1407.92s - 1408.80s |  gets knocked out
1408.80s - 1410.16s |  by an anti-satellite missile
1410.16s - 1411.36s |  or something along those lines
1411.36s - 1413.60s |  or similar wild scenarios
1413.60s - 1414.72s |  or something like we saw
1414.72s - 1415.84s |  with the KASAT event
1415.84s - 1416.48s |  with the distributed
1416.48s - 1418.32s |  denial of service mechanism
1418.32s - 1419.60s |  that was used in parallel
1419.60s - 1421.60s |  with the acid rain wiper
1421.60s - 1422.88s |  that was causing significant
1422.88s - 1424.48s |  degradation to that network.
1424.48s - 1425.76s |  How do we operate in a way
1425.76s - 1427.12s |  that if this link is removed,
1427.12s - 1428.40s |  that we have a backup link
1428.40s - 1430.64s |  or a way of securely
1430.64s - 1432.56s |  and safely winding down operations
1432.56s - 1434.40s |  until those links can be restored?
1434.40s - 1435.20s |  That's going to cost
1435.20s - 1436.96s |  a little bit of money, unfortunately.
1436.96s - 1438.48s |  But if we want to reap
1438.48s - 1440.48s |  the rewards of having
1440.48s - 1441.92s |  the flexibility created
1441.92s - 1443.60s |  by these sorts of environments,
1443.60s - 1444.56s |  we need to ensure
1444.56s - 1445.52s |  that we're also doing so
1445.52s - 1447.36s |  in a way that is maintainable
1447.36s - 1448.24s |  and sustainable
1448.24s - 1449.28s |  in realistic fashion.
1450.32s - 1451.12s |  It also means,
1451.12s - 1452.88s |  and this is where we come to DEF CON
1452.88s - 1454.48s |  and most of the audience here,
1454.48s - 1455.68s |  offensive security testing
1455.68s - 1457.20s |  has a role to play here.
1457.20s - 1458.48s |  Validating communications
1458.48s - 1459.20s |  and how they work,
1459.20s - 1461.20s |  especially from an adversary's mindset
1461.20s - 1462.96s |  and when the eyes of disruption
1462.96s - 1463.84s |  is critical,
1463.84s - 1465.44s |  which means offensive testing,
1465.44s - 1466.32s |  which could be anything
1466.32s - 1467.68s |  from tabletop exercises
1467.68s - 1468.48s |  that run through like,
1468.48s - 1470.00s |  oh, wait, if that goes away,
1470.00s - 1471.36s |  what do we actually do?
1471.36s - 1473.12s |  To validating that certain networks
1473.12s - 1474.80s |  can be reached or interacted with
1474.80s - 1475.84s |  through over-the-air links
1475.84s - 1476.72s |  and thus demonstrating
1476.72s - 1478.16s |  risk to decision makers that,
1478.16s - 1478.80s |  oh, wait a minute,
1478.80s - 1480.08s |  this is not a notional problem,
1480.08s - 1481.76s |  but actually can manifest,
1481.76s - 1484.16s |  can allow asset owners to deploy
1484.16s - 1485.28s |  while evaluating
1485.28s - 1487.28s |  what risk propositions are available.
1487.28s - 1488.08s |  And this gets into
1488.08s - 1489.20s |  a variety of disciplines
1489.20s - 1490.16s |  that become very interesting
1490.16s - 1491.12s |  very quickly
1491.12s - 1492.40s |  in terms of what we can do
1492.40s - 1493.84s |  to test and validate
1493.84s - 1495.12s |  how these networks are deployed
1495.12s - 1495.84s |  and how they function.
1496.72s - 1498.32s |  In terms of additional considerations,
1498.32s - 1499.12s |  there are other things
1499.12s - 1500.08s |  that we need to worry about,
1500.08s - 1501.28s |  and we only have a short period
1501.28s - 1502.24s |  of time here,
1502.24s - 1503.68s |  but I'll have a link to some resources
1503.68s - 1504.24s |  if you want to look
1504.24s - 1505.04s |  a little bit further,
1505.68s - 1507.04s |  that we do have the possibility
1507.04s - 1507.84s |  of physical attacks
1507.84s - 1509.20s |  and disruptions on remote links,
1509.92s - 1510.88s |  insecure protocols
1510.88s - 1511.76s |  that are used over the air,
1511.76s - 1512.40s |  which I talked about
1512.40s - 1513.60s |  a little bit already,
1513.60s - 1514.48s |  as well as latency
1514.48s - 1515.76s |  and observability concerns
1515.76s - 1516.64s |  that come about
1516.64s - 1517.60s |  with communications
1517.60s - 1518.56s |  that start getting pushed
1518.56s - 1519.52s |  into more extreme
1519.52s - 1521.76s |  and more interesting arenas.
1521.76s - 1522.48s |  But overall,
1523.12s - 1524.08s |  the central point
1524.08s - 1525.12s |  or thesis behind this
1525.12s - 1526.32s |  is that we're in a state
1526.32s - 1527.76s |  where we've extended attack surface,
1527.76s - 1529.76s |  but haven't really validated
1529.76s - 1531.60s |  how we will operate securely
1531.60s - 1533.20s |  and safely in that new environment
1533.20s - 1533.84s |  as effectively
1533.84s - 1535.12s |  as I think that we should.
1535.12s - 1536.24s |  And these are considerations
1536.24s - 1536.96s |  that asset owners
1536.96s - 1537.84s |  need to keep in mind.
1538.40s - 1539.28s |  So I don't think we have
1539.28s - 1540.24s |  much time for questions,
1540.24s - 1542.24s |  but before I get back to that slide,
1542.24s - 1543.44s |  if anyone wants to snap a link,
1543.44s - 1544.40s |  a picture of this
1544.40s - 1545.60s |  or these slides will be available
1545.60s - 1547.20s |  on the media server, I believe.
1547.20s - 1548.64s |  Just a couple of links to articles
1548.64s - 1550.16s |  and some of the things I talked about.
1550.16s - 1551.60s |  But also, if you're really interested
1551.60s - 1552.32s |  in a deep dive
1552.32s - 1553.92s |  into one particular event on this,
1553.92s - 1555.60s |  I'll be presenting at length,
1555.60s - 1557.28s |  including a very lengthy paper
1557.28s - 1558.64s |  at the Virus Bulletin Conference
1558.64s - 1559.28s |  later this year
1559.36s - 1560.80s |  on the KASAT incident.
1560.80s - 1562.16s |  That'll get published in October.
1562.16s - 1563.68s |  So bookmark this if you're interested
1563.68s - 1564.96s |  and really want to explore
1564.96s - 1566.24s |  the nuts and bolts of what
1566.24s - 1567.52s |  not just an attack scenario
1567.52s - 1568.56s |  looks like in this regard,
1568.56s - 1571.20s |  but also what defensive options exist
1571.20s - 1572.00s |  when it comes to doing
1572.00s - 1573.36s |  this sort of activity.
1573.36s - 1574.56s |  So that's forthcoming.
1574.56s - 1576.16s |  And certainly look out for that
1576.16s - 1577.60s |  if you are interested.
1577.60s - 1579.92s |  Otherwise, there's my information.
1579.92s - 1581.60s |  So happy to answer questions.
1581.60s - 1583.44s |  I know we got a quick turnaround time here.
1583.44s - 1584.72s |  So I will hang out
1584.72s - 1585.76s |  probably in the back of the room
1585.76s - 1587.68s |  so that our next speaker can get ready.
1587.68s - 1590.08s |  And yeah, I'm good to go.
1590.08s - 1591.52s |  Thanks, everyone, for hanging out.
