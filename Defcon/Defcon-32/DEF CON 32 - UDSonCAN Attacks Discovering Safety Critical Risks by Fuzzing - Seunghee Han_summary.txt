**Introduction to UDSonCAN Attacks**
- Presenter: Seunghee Han, security researcher from Autocrypt
- Focus: Safety-critical risks discovered through **fuzzing** on latest **electric vehicle** (EV) models

**UDSonCAN and Fuzzing**
- **UDS**: Protocol for communication with vehicles, defined in **ISO 14229**
- **Fuzzing**: Testing method using random data to find system vulnerabilities
- **Objective**: Discover weak points in EV models through fuzzing tests

**Key Attack Scenarios**
- **Scenario 1**: **Sudden Stop**
  - Involves sending **ECU reset** message to a moving vehicle
  - Causes vehicle to stop suddenly without warning
- **Scenario 2**: **Vehicle Disabling**
  - Continuous **ECU reset** messages disable vehicle functions
  - Prevents vehicle from starting or gear shifting

**ECU Reset Attack**
- **ECU Reset**: Used for troubleshooting/resetting vehicle's ECU
- **Problems**: ECU reset not disabled in drive mode, posing danger
- **Test Setup**: Using laptop connected to vehicle's **OBD port** via **CAN interface**

**Communication Control Attack**
- **Communication Control**: Manages ECU communication functions
- **Sub Functions**: 
  - Sub function 1: Enables RX and disables TX
  - Sub function 3: Disables both RX and TX
- **Problems**: Communication control not disabled in drive mode, lacks security authentication

**Attack Consequences**
- **Mechanical Failure**: Attacks can lead to mechanical issues or accidents
- **Uncontrollable Vehicle**: Continuous attacks prevent vehicle control, causing safety risks

**Attack Methods**
- **Wireless OBD Device**: Allows attacker to connect without detection
- **Short-Range Wireless Communication**: Possible via **Wi-Fi** or **Bluetooth**

**Countermeasures**
- Services like **ECU reset** and **communication control** should only operate in a not ready state (engine off)
- Implement **security access authorization** for critical services

**Security Enhancements**
- **Security Access Service**: Uses seed and key for authentication
- **Gateway Safety Function**: Filters data, allowing access to specific information only

**Conclusion**
- Importance of securing diagnostic services to prevent potential attacks
- Presentation aimed to highlight vulnerabilities and propose solutions for enhanced vehicle security
