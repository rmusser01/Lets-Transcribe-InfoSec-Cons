  "description": "In this talk, I will share my journey from a novice to a seasoned hunter. I will explore how I used to report low-impact, informative bugs when I first started, and how I progressively improved by learning from the community, embracing failures/duplicates, and incorporating feedback from triage teams and clients. This journey of continuous learning and adaptation led me from reporting low vulnerabilities to effectively chaining and converting them into critical impacts.\n\nThis session is designed for both aspiring and experienced bug bounty hunters. By reflecting on a decade of lessons learned, I will aim to provide valuable takeaways that can help others navigate their own paths in bug bounty hunting and enhance their skills.\n\nAdditionally, one Synack triage team member will join me on this talk to help differentiate triage thinking from bug bounty hunters' thinking, providing valuable insights into the collaborative process of vulnerability reporting to acceptance.",

0.00s - 3.92s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Okay guys, we'd like to welcome you and thank you guys for showing up. Hopefully everybody's
3.92s - 8.72s |  having a really great DEF CON. A lot of great talks out there. We're hoping that ours is at
8.72s - 13.60s |  least mediocre for you guys. We're going to be discussing 10 years in bug bounties
14.24s - 20.32s |  and what we've learned, how we've learned from my perspective as a triage and the enemy, so to speak.
21.36s - 24.88s |  If anybody has submitted stuff, who all has submitted stuff to bug bounties?
25.84s - 31.44s |  Right. Now who all has been frustrated with triage? Okay. So yeah, I'll be the bad guy today.
32.64s - 37.12s |  Nick's here. He is one of the top hackers. He'll introduce himself and his credentials also.
37.12s - 41.12s |  And he's going to be speaking from the researcher side that said, I'm also a researcher. So we're
41.12s - 46.96s |  going to be kind of having a discussion as to how can you have the best experience as a bug bounty
46.96s - 52.08s |  hunter and have the best chance of success and what does success look like? So that's going to
52.16s - 55.04s |  be what we're going through with this talk. So hopefully you guys get something out of it.
57.09s - 63.09s |  So how many of you are full-time bug bounty hunter here? Just one.
63.09s - 63.49s |  Sort of.
66.29s - 74.69s |  So we kind of doing this talk because I've been into bug bounty since a decade. So
75.49s - 82.61s |  I'm just trying to explain all the experiences and how a bug bounty can be a full-time carrier
82.61s - 92.45s |  for you as well. So it's kind of a daytime job as well and nighttime too. So I've been
94.45s - 103.25s |  doing a lot of bug bounties on SYNAC platform. And I recently been awarded as a SYNAC Red Team
103.25s - 110.93s |  legend. I also a founder of B-Sides Ahmedabad. It's the conference and it's biggest conference
110.93s - 118.85s |  in India. And I also have been advisor to an ASM product. So Charlie.
119.73s - 126.69s |  Guys, generally I'd like to say hi. I have a really unusual background. A lot of people in
126.69s - 130.85s |  the security space do. A lot of us are not just coming straight out of school as bug bounty
130.85s - 137.17s |  hunters, as Red Team. I spent over two decades in customer service and dealing with as an
137.17s - 142.53s |  international translator and international manager for an airline. Then decided I love
142.53s - 148.45s |  technology. It's always been a passion of mine. I was the guy who built Napster servers. I got my
148.45s - 154.85s |  MCSE for amusement one time. So I was that guy who grew up with these old systems and
154.85s - 158.85s |  just loved it enough that then I started really studying coming back into the field
158.85s - 164.13s |  and was really, really blessed to have an opportunity to come in as a triager
164.13s - 172.05s |  and in SYNAC's vulnerability operations team. I have also helped go over 2,400 different
172.05s - 178.29s |  assessments and have probably, I think last poll was somewhere around 40,000 individual reports.
178.85s - 182.93s |  So I've seen quite a few things. I've talked to some people who I have actually triaged their
182.93s - 191.33s |  reports. So few of them in the audience. I have headed developments on some products around OWASP,
191.33s - 197.17s |  NIST, OSINT, API, headless API, and most recently some AI testing.
197.17s - 200.53s |  So a lot of breadth on our testing and how we go about these things.
202.13s - 211.73s |  So I'll walk you through my journey, how I started and how I continue my full-time bug bounty
212.45s - 224.05s |  stuff, and what are my experiences and what are my failures, how I keep on continuing and finding
224.05s - 237.81s |  bugs and earning from it. So I started in 2013. So I wasn't aware about bug bounties at that time
237.81s - 246.93s |  because there is not much exposures of bug bounties at that time. Only Google and PayPal
246.93s - 257.17s |  was running bug bounty programs at that time. And it's not that much visible to anybody like
257.73s - 271.81s |  a non-bug bounty person. So I dropped out from college because I do not like much of, I do not
271.81s - 282.05s |  have much interest in their knowledge and stuff like that. So I dropped in 2012 and I started
282.05s - 293.09s |  looking for the job. So I accidentally joined an ethical hacking training company. And I usually
293.09s - 303.09s |  go out of money like in less than a month. And I had no idea about bug bounties and stuff.
303.09s - 315.57s |  And so one day, one of my co-workers, he was sitting on a computer and he was submitting some
315.57s - 325.41s |  accesses to PayPal. And after a few days, he got some bounty from the PayPal. So he posted an image
325.41s - 333.17s |  on Facebook. So Facebook was quite used application at that time. So he posted a photo on
333.17s - 342.37s |  Facebook. And after a few days, I've seen that photo. And next day, I went to the office and asked
342.37s - 352.93s |  him what exactly is this. So he described me that some companies pay bounties if you submit some
352.93s - 367.97s |  vulnerabilities to them. So then from there, I got introduced to bug bounties. And since then, I
367.97s - 374.77s |  started doing a lot of research on what other companies are there to, which is running the
374.85s - 384.53s |  independent programs. And I only get like two companies, Google and PayPal during that time. And
384.53s - 390.85s |  no other companies was running an independent program. So there was no, there was, right now,
390.85s - 403.01s |  there is a lot of bug bounty platforms that are running a lot of programs over them. But there was
403.01s - 412.85s |  not much, not much exposure of bug bounty platforms during that time. But more of independent
412.85s - 416.61s |  programs running on, running their bug bounty themselves.
418.85s - 424.61s |  I think there was an interesting point you made there is that the bug bounty space is very much a
424.61s - 431.81s |  show me thing. You can be the guy who is a doctorate, cert it up, has every cert out there, you've run
431.81s - 437.81s |  SANS, you've been the SANS instructor. But if you can't put rubber on the road, the guy who doesn't
437.81s - 443.01s |  even have a high school degree is going to beat you. This is a very egalitarian space. I can say
443.01s - 447.89s |  on our end as a triage team, we don't look at that. I don't care what your certs are. I care what you
447.89s - 453.49s |  found. So this is a space that all that stuff is a matter of your skill set and what you do.
454.05s - 458.77s |  And so I think there's a really good thought there is that none of that matters. And this is a chance
458.77s - 462.53s |  for you guys to start working and get some of the best in the world at biting Google engineers and
462.53s - 466.93s |  seeing if you're smarter. The good news is they have to be right 100%. We only have to be right
466.93s - 479.46s |  once. So when I was searching for Google bug bounties, I came across a lot of blogs. And there
479.46s - 487.22s |  was one blog and this guy, this guy is a good friend of mine now. But at that time, it was
487.22s - 496.02s |  unknown. But he just went to the some Google application and he writes some
499.06s - 505.38s |  simple access payload and the payload got triggered. So he got bounty out of it. So I was
505.38s - 516.66s |  like, he got a very simple bug, simple bug from the Google and got a bounty out of it. So I got
516.74s - 523.86s |  really motivated out of it. So I thought that let's try, let's try these things on other Google
523.86s - 534.26s |  products as well. But I later realized that these, these stuff looks simple, but you have to dig a
534.26s - 542.10s |  lot deeper and you have to know about Google products and services to actually, actually get
542.10s - 550.10s |  these issues. But these are, I mean, these are just old stuff. You can't find them nowadays.
551.30s - 563.46s |  Only if you are lucky. So, so I thought of give it a try to Google bug bounty first. So I was,
564.26s - 569.78s |  during that time I was no idea about the bug, just submitting a simple, any random stuff
570.42s - 582.42s |  without any logic and simply getting either rejected, no impact, duplicates or Hall of Fame
582.42s - 593.70s |  only. So I reported like whole year to Google and I just got duplicates or rejected reports.
594.58s - 599.78s |  So one of the interesting things on this is that when we're out hunting and I'm just as guilty of
599.78s - 604.74s |  it as anybody else, you see something, you get excited. Let me ask this. How many blue teamers
604.74s - 612.10s |  do we have in developers on the backend that are in the room? Few guys, right? As a researcher,
612.10s - 616.34s |  it's really easy to sit and say, oh my gosh, I just found this and go, it's not a duplicate.
616.34s - 620.02s |  It's another path. But you got to ask yourself, is that the same code on the backend? Because
620.50s - 625.54s |  Amazon doesn't code each product separately, guys. We know that. So it's the same things.
625.54s - 628.82s |  We've got to kind of ask ourselves as a researcher, wait a minute, is this really a duplicate? Is the
628.82s - 632.90s |  same code on the backend? You've got to get a little critical. You've also got to think,
632.90s - 638.66s |  and he'd said about impact. The problem with this is, let me ask this. If you're looking at say an
638.66s - 645.30s |  HSTS flag missing, what's the malicious use case? What are you going to do with it? Probably
645.30s - 651.14s |  nothing. If you can do something, show me. And so very much when you talk to a triager,
651.14s - 655.54s |  show me the malicious use case. If you've got a cross-site scripting, but it's unauthenticated,
655.54s - 659.54s |  what are you going to really do with that? Show me that you can pop a document.cookie,
659.54s - 666.02s |  document.domain, and then explain to me, yeah, that way I can get their credentials out. I would
666.02s - 670.74s |  just have to send that to my server. That way I can clearly see the malicious use. Make sure you
670.74s - 676.26s |  show that impact. I would say 80% of our rejections are probably because of low impact.
677.06s - 680.58s |  And that it's just, you haven't proven what that malicious use case is,
680.58s - 684.18s |  that now I need to go to my client and tell them, I need you to spend engineering time,
684.74s - 688.82s |  not only money on this bounty, but now I need you to spend cycles off your engineering
688.82s - 694.50s |  to fix this. And that's my business use case I need to make as a triage or isn't this worth fixing.
695.78s - 699.78s |  So whenever you're looking at these things, we can't just look at it as a pure security thing.
700.98s - 707.06s |  As security practitioners, we want every last I dot and D crossed and perfection. But some of
707.06s - 710.98s |  these things are just acceptable risk and we have to think about it and go, is it really okay?
710.98s - 715.86s |  It might be. Unfortunately, we've had to look at it and say Google API keys are very similar
715.86s - 721.38s |  to this process. The fix is extremely expensive. Google has said it's not something that they're
721.38s - 725.62s |  particularly interested in and nobody's done it and it's going to cost them a lot of money to fix it
726.58s - 732.10s |  when the risk is pretty minimal. So we have to kind of consider those things as security
732.10s - 736.66s |  practitioners and just not say we have to fix everything. Let's fix the important things.
736.66s - 741.78s |  And so when we're looking at a report, I always have to ask myself, and I'm as guilty as anybody
741.78s - 746.90s |  when I'm doing my own reports is getting excited about the flaw. I have to come back and go,
746.90s - 752.50s |  is this really a risk? What's my impact? And so a lot of what Nick was saying here at the beginning
752.74s - 759.62s |  is duplicate, no impact. And those are what people run into all the time as beginning bounty hunters.
761.14s - 765.22s |  I know a couple of people in this room that have had the same experience as me.
765.22s - 769.14s |  Somebody new will come in. They'll get excited. They're going to submit a dozen reports.
769.14s - 772.18s |  That's Friday night. They're going out with their buddies going, I'm going to quit my job because I
772.18s - 779.46s |  just wanted $6,000 in bounties. I am the most badass mofo on this planet. I'm quitting my job.
779.94s - 783.78s |  He goes out, he parties Saturday, he parties, he maxes out the credit card because I've got
783.78s - 792.02s |  $7,000 in bounties and money I rejected all in 10 minutes. He does not have happy words for me.
792.58s - 795.78s |  And I'm going, yeah, this is all on our low impact list. Did you read the documentation?
797.46s - 802.26s |  And so these are the things you have to think through is just slow down and ask yourself,
803.54s - 806.98s |  what do I need to do? What is that triage you're going to do? Because their job is to be a little
806.98s - 810.34s |  critical and to force you to get better. So show the impact.
814.64s - 824.40s |  So if something didn't work out, you have to move on from that particular thing. And you have to,
824.40s - 830.40s |  I mean, there are a lot of stuff in the world, so you can move on and do other stuff too.
830.40s - 839.04s |  So maybe you will get lucky to have more success on that particular program
839.04s - 850.64s |  rather than the previous one. So I moved on at that time and I heard about Nokia phone was,
851.28s - 858.80s |  there was a Nokia phone coming at that time. So they were running a VDP program, but their VDP
858.80s - 863.92s |  program is something like that. If you're finding any critical vulnerabilities on their program,
863.92s - 874.24s |  so they're giving out their smartphones to hackers. So what I did, I listed out all their
875.20s - 883.36s |  assets and I started fuzzing for just for a SQLite because I was kind of more proficient
883.36s - 890.48s |  into finding a SQLite at that time. So this is how we react when a new program, when we see a
890.48s - 902.00s |  new program. So like I said, I listed all their assets and started testing the SQLite. And one of
902.00s - 911.60s |  their assets I got a SQL error and further I went ahead and just one or two commands and I was able
911.60s - 920.80s |  to dump their whole DB. So from here they actually sent me some Lumia 820 devices.
924.08s - 928.72s |  So I think the one thing that we can take from this part of what Nix did and you heard him say
928.72s - 934.64s |  this was an area I was interested in. If you have an area that you have an interest in or that you
934.64s - 940.88s |  have experience in your full-time job, if you're a SQL database engineer, you're in good shape
941.76s - 949.20s |  because you know what to do with those databases to get SQL injections. If you are a web designer,
949.20s - 955.36s |  you've got a lot of that stuff to understand how to abuse HTML. So use the stuff that you're
955.36s - 959.84s |  interested in and all of a sudden he said, I focus on just SQLite. Focus on that one thing.
960.88s - 965.44s |  Then take that one thing, run with it until you become the expert at it. You're going to start
965.44s - 969.60s |  getting to where you feel it. I've heard these guys a lot of times just say, I felt this,
969.60s - 974.72s |  I just knew it was there. That sixth sense is developed by repetition and doing it over and
974.72s - 980.08s |  over. And when you do that, you become really proficient in that thing. And so what you're
980.08s - 986.24s |  seeing, I think that Nix is describing is focus on that subject. Don't let yourself go for
986.24s - 991.04s |  everything. The field is huge. Focus on one or two things until you get proficient at it,
991.04s - 995.76s |  then you can add a new thing. And so yeah, smartphones are not bad. Also he's shifted
995.76s - 1000.32s |  to a program that had less competition. Sometimes, especially if you're new,
1001.12s - 1007.20s |  going up against guys like this, it's going to be a tough road. If you can go against the people
1007.20s - 1010.72s |  who are a little less skilled because he's not going out for smartphones today,
1011.68s - 1017.68s |  maybe their recognition programs, there may be a good point to going there and learning
1017.68s - 1027.73s |  and using that as an education tool. So key takeaways from this is don't give up
1027.73s - 1040.21s |  anytime. And when one opportunity closes, another opens up. So if you find any critical
1040.21s - 1052.37s |  vulnerabilities on any of the assets and if you get a good bug and a good reward, so you will get
1052.37s - 1061.33s |  a lot of motivation out of it. So what motivation do? Motivation actually do a lot of big things.
1063.89s - 1069.97s |  In bug bounties, motivation counts a lot because if you are motivated, then you will be able to
1069.97s - 1080.45s |  find more impactful vulnerabilities. So I got motivated because of the last critical bug I
1080.45s - 1092.61s |  found on the Nokia program. And I continued. So in mid-2013, there was more programs come up
1093.57s - 1106.05s |  such as Mozilla started their web services bug bounties. Baracuda Labs also has a web application
1106.05s - 1116.13s |  firewall bug bounties running. And they actually given out live devices on a virtual platform. And
1117.17s - 1128.93s |  the PayPal is running since 2009. All of these running independent programs. So I was able to get
1129.33s - 1142.05s |  some issues on these programs and get some bounties out of it. So like I said, these are all
1142.61s - 1153.41s |  things which I did when I got some motivation from the last bugs. So it's kind of thing that if I
1153.41s - 1163.01s |  continue doing Google, I might get about $500 or $1,000 bounty after two or three years. But I
1163.01s - 1171.09s |  lost, I can loss all my motivation until then because you are doing bug bounties till three years
1171.09s - 1181.09s |  and you are only getting $500 or $1,000 or something like that. But what I did, I keep on
1181.09s - 1191.81s |  learning things from my rejections. So I get a failure from Google but I also ask them why you
1191.81s - 1202.69s |  rejected my bug. So they actually explain you that why we rejected. So they also tells you that if
1202.69s - 1214.53s |  you can do this, then we can accept that bug and move it to the award category. So that is how the
1214.53s - 1215.57s |  motivation works. Yeah.
1216.21s - 1221.89s |  Yeah. One important note here from the triage side, it's your triagers are always happy to tell
1221.89s - 1226.93s |  you why something wasn't accepted. I don't think any of our triagers just go, I don't have time,
1226.93s - 1233.25s |  go away. Because what we're trying to do is show you what number one did not work. So that way,
1233.25s - 1237.65s |  quite frankly, you don't fill up my inbox with junk and keep doing the same thing again.
1238.77s - 1244.29s |  So if you get a rejection, ask and try and understand why. And a lot of times they'll be
1244.29s - 1250.85s |  able to tell you, but if you can do this, now I'll take it. So that's your kind of explanation. And
1250.85s - 1255.57s |  this usually resolves around impact, but they'll be able to tell you, hey, this is just, we're
1255.57s - 1260.13s |  going to be low impact. We kind of don't care about this. You had an eye door. Yeah. You could
1260.13s - 1264.21s |  get into somebody else's account, but you know what? You weren't logged in. You're just changing
1264.21s - 1270.29s |  their basket at the pizza place and get rid of a pizza. Who cares? You're not getting them to pay
1270.29s - 1276.13s |  for your pizza. So understand why they're looking at it the way they are. For example, cross-site
1276.13s - 1280.29s |  scripting. If you're not logged in, there's no data to come out of it. No, there's no malicious
1280.29s - 1286.13s |  use. And they'll be clearly just happy to say, hey, it's an unauthenticated cross-site scripting.
1286.13s - 1291.09s |  I can't take that. There's no impact. So ask them, communicate. They are very happy to communicate
1291.09s - 1295.73s |  these things. And part of their job is to think through them and go, okay, why won't I accept
1295.73s - 1301.81s |  this? So they know the reason. So talk to them, take that feedback and learn. I've seen way too
1301.81s - 1307.49s |  many people come in and just say, I submit the flaw. It gets rejected. And I tell you why.
1307.49s - 1313.41s |  And next week you submit the same flaw and it gets rejected. And I tell you why. And a few days
1313.41s - 1319.25s |  later, you submit a flaw. So just the same. And we go through this process and it keeps knocking
1319.25s - 1324.05s |  down the researcher's motivation, which is not at all what we want to do, but it's taking that
1324.05s - 1329.57s |  feedback and understanding what they're saying. They are now your teachers to help educate you
1329.57s - 1334.29s |  to how to make yourself a better pen tester in your normal day job, how to become a better bug
1334.29s - 1339.41s |  bounty hunter, how to do, how to improve overall. It may be that we're saying, improve your reporting
1339.41s - 1343.73s |  techniques, you know, that I need more detailed steps. A lot of times you guys will be in that
1343.73s - 1350.05s |  app for hours. I have never seen it before. I'm walking into a blind to reproduce your volume
1350.05s - 1353.97s |  and try and understand, does it have impact? If you haven't clearly explained it clearly showed me,
1355.57s - 1359.33s |  maybe I can't do it because I don't have the details and the knowledge of, oh, I redid this.
1360.13s - 1365.01s |  So make sure you're very clear to us, explain it, understand why we rejected it and ask questions.
1367.97s - 1376.45s |  So, uh, so in, uh, in 2014 or mid 2014, there was, uh, uh, I got to know about, uh, these three
1376.45s - 1385.25s |  platforms running, uh, some bug bounty programs on their platform. And, uh, um, and, uh, well,
1385.25s - 1391.01s |  well, uh, HackerOne and BugCrowd was available to sign up directly. And, uh, and the SINAC was
1391.01s - 1396.61s |  doing some, uh, hands-on assessment, uh, which includes, uh, written and, uh, ID verification
1396.61s - 1405.60s |  or something like that. And, uh, uh, and, uh, uh, once you, uh, once you, uh, once you passed on
1405.60s - 1411.04s |  the written and, uh, ID verification, you, uh, you will be onboarded on the, on the platform.
1411.04s - 1417.12s |  But, uh, but, but, uh, other two platforms, uh, they are, uh, directly available for signup. I
1417.12s - 1425.28s |  guess, uh, HackerOne, HackerOne do not have, uh, uh, do not have, uh, uh, uh, a web application
1425.28s - 1433.04s |  bug bounty platform, bug bounty program until, uh, the Yahoo comes in, uh, in 2014 end, I guess.
1433.04s - 1435.68s |  It just knows it's vintage logo. I haven't seen that forever.
1436.56s - 1442.00s |  So one of the things that kind of is interesting about the bug bounty model, and a lot of you guys
1442.00s - 1446.16s |  are kind of like, why did those companies exist? First of all, for you guys, it consolidates it.
1446.72s - 1449.84s |  Gives you one place you can find a bunch of targets instead of having to Google all over the
1449.84s - 1454.32s |  place. Additionally, you don't have to send it to the company and hope that they don't just go,
1454.32s - 1457.92s |  yeah, I'm going to reject that, but, uh, thank you. And I'm going to fix it anyway.
1457.92s - 1461.68s |  You know, we're kind of your middleman there to protect you. Um, but that said,
1461.68s - 1467.28s |  we're also hired for the company's protection to reduce the noise, um, and go through and say,
1467.28s - 1471.28s |  is this valid for them on their behalf? And we're an impartial third party.
1471.28s - 1475.36s |  I can tell you that when I paid a vol, there was nothing. It doesn't come out of my pocket.
1475.36s - 1479.28s |  Um, it was a big joke to a lot of people like, oh, they're lowering my CVSS. They don't want to
1479.28s - 1483.84s |  pay this. They don't want to pay that. We're in the business to pay vols. If I don't pay any vols
1483.84s - 1489.28s |  on the target, my client gets mad. So I need to pay these volts. I need, if I've got a bonus out
1489.28s - 1494.00s |  there, I need to kind of pay it. That's why I'm putting a bonus on it. The money it becomes,
1494.00s - 1499.04s |  I can say this after paying thousands and thousands, probably well over a couple,
1499.04s - 1504.00s |  probably half a million dollars out that I've spent personally. It's monopoly money to me.
1504.00s - 1509.68s |  I press that button. It's not 500. It's not a thousand. It's not $4,000. It's just a button.
1511.04s - 1514.72s |  It doesn't matter to me. It never processes in my head that I just spent $10,000.
1515.12s - 1520.16s |  So your triagers are not sitting and thinking, you go, I need to hold on to this money.
1520.16s - 1524.00s |  That's not how it works for us. We don't even get really accountable for it. It's just,
1524.00s - 1528.24s |  do we do it right? Was it a valid vol? Yeah. Did you pay what it's supposed to be paid? Yep. Okay,
1528.24s - 1533.52s |  good. So your triagers are not trying to hold this money back. We don't get bonuses based off
1533.52s - 1538.96s |  what I didn't pay you guys. You know, that's not the whole different game if it was, but
1539.60s - 1543.60s |  so understand that the bounty platforms are actually here to number one,
1543.68s - 1547.52s |  show you where everything's at so that you can be efficient with your time and not have to search
1547.52s - 1552.64s |  new projects. Number two, we're your impartial third party to make sure that what you're
1552.64s - 1556.56s |  submitting is good for our clients and that the clients are being fair to you.
1559.50s - 1568.14s |  So when HackerOne started their first program, that is Yahoo. So I got the first book and that
1568.14s - 1575.42s |  is, uh, uh, Yahoo mail, uh, Yahoo mobile mail accesses. And, uh, uh, they paid me only two,
1575.42s - 1582.94s |  seven, seven dollars. And, uh, so I was, I was confused at why it is paid so low because it was
1582.94s - 1590.86s |  under their, uh, Yahoo mobile email. That is their main application. So, uh, I think, uh, then,
1590.86s - 1596.46s |  then, uh, I thought I, I probably lacked that demonstrating the impact here. And, uh, that's
1596.46s - 1605.58s |  why, uh, the bounty was so low. Then, uh, the bug crowd, I submitted like, uh, uh, 48 plus 29.
1605.58s - 1612.86s |  I don't know how, how much it is. And, uh, uh, so just 29 accepted and 48 was duplicate. So
1613.74s - 1620.54s |  when you do a bug bounty, duplicates are part of it. And, uh, uh, you, uh, you just have to,
1620.54s - 1626.06s |  uh, take, uh, take into consideration that you will get the duplicates because someone will
1626.14s - 1630.70s |  be faster than you, uh, in submitted vulnerabilities. If, if someone has automation,
1630.70s - 1639.42s |  uh, automation, they will be more faster than you. And then the last, the report writing. So,
1639.42s - 1648.14s |  so, uh, I had a worst report writing, uh, at that time. And, uh, uh, it was, it was causing,
1648.14s - 1655.58s |  uh, it was causing a lot of problems to me. Uh, so, uh, that, that is, that is the struggle. So
1656.54s - 1662.78s |  yeah, I'm going to say this on report writing. Um, I've worked with a lot of our top guys. Um,
1662.78s - 1668.38s |  and if said, some of them come back and said, at first I hated y'all, you know, I thought y'all
1668.38s - 1671.50s |  were just running me through the ringer. I felt you were going to have to do all this stuff,
1671.50s - 1677.50s |  jumping through all the hoops. And later they said, you know, at my day job, I'm now 10 times
1677.50s - 1682.46s |  better at writing a report because of what you made me do. Um, we don't want these reports that
1682.46s - 1690.70s |  say there's an injection. Here's your line impact. I took your stuff. I got to give me
1690.70s - 1695.82s |  more than that. You've got to write it as a compelling story. Because when I go to a CISO
1696.46s - 1701.50s |  and particularly if I go to a CEO, I hate to tell you guys, he doesn't know, nor care what an idol
1701.50s - 1707.18s |  is. He doesn't care what SQL is. He doesn't know. That's not his job to know those things. He goes
1707.18s - 1712.22s |  to SQL. I don't whatever. If I tell him, I just downloaded your entire database and could delete
1712.22s - 1717.90s |  your entire production database. And I know who all your customers are. Are you caring now? Now
1717.90s - 1724.54s |  he cares because he knows that that's a newsworthy item. Tell me that scary story. Do this in detail.
1724.54s - 1728.62s |  Show me what can happen. You don't have to actually go out and publish it on the dark web,
1728.62s - 1734.22s |  of course, that wouldn't work out well for us. Um, but if you go ahead and you just say, look,
1734.22s - 1741.34s |  cross-site scripting, I've got document.cookie. I can send this out to my server and now harvest
1741.34s - 1745.82s |  credentials. And it's, you know, now it's persistent. Any logged in user, I can pull
1745.82s - 1750.22s |  that from them. If they go to that page, I can get your leads. I can get your engineers. I can
1750.22s - 1755.66s |  get your creds too. Now you've told me a scary story that I can take to the client. You've also
1755.66s - 1760.70s |  made it clear to the triage team who may not be as clear on that type of bond as you are, because
1760.70s - 1765.34s |  like we said, you're working to become that world-class expert in it. You may actually know
1765.34s - 1770.94s |  more about that impact. So clarify your impact, write those reports, take a little bit longer and
1770.94s - 1776.86s |  write a more verbose story, really give us extremely detailed steps as our reproduce,
1778.14s - 1781.98s |  and then give us some good feedback on how to fix this thing. Because you may know more than
1781.98s - 1785.26s |  the engineering team because to be blunt, they screwed it up in the first place.
1786.30s - 1791.42s |  So tell us, talk to us, be that story writer. I know as technical people, we want to keep it
1791.42s - 1796.54s |  concise to the point and no extra fat. In this case, sometimes getting a little wordier is worth
1796.62s - 1802.06s |  time and will significantly improve your reporting. When you have a report that I love,
1803.42s - 1807.82s |  it's clear to me, and now I can start accepting it a lot more. If you start giving me garbage
1807.82s - 1811.58s |  reports that are real brief and real short, it's real easy for me to miss your point
1812.54s - 1815.90s |  and what you're actually getting at. So make sure you explain it,
1815.90s - 1819.26s |  over explain it a little bit. Tell me those scary stories and the impact.
1820.14s - 1827.26s |  Yeah. So I figured out that whatever the shortcomings, it's like always looking,
1827.26s - 1833.26s |  I'm always looking for low-hanging fruits. Worst report writing, like in chaining the report to
1833.26s - 1839.66s |  make it more impactful, and obviously not so fast in reporting and the target approach.
1840.38s - 1844.70s |  Nix, I'm going to say one thing about low-hanging fruit. When I first started,
1844.70s - 1848.70s |  I thought Metasploit was the answer to everything. Great tool, a lot of fun,
1849.82s - 1853.42s |  in two and a half years, I saw exactly one ball that was found with Metasploit. I was doing
1853.42s - 1859.02s |  dozens a day. It's a very well-known tool that's a low-hanging fruit. Your dev team should be
1859.02s - 1864.30s |  using it. If they're not, they need to be, right? These scanners, we're going to have to go deeper.
1865.42s - 1869.58s |  You're going to have to really learn about the exploit, not just depend on the low-hanging
1869.58s - 1874.54s |  fruit popping from the scanners. If that's what you're depending on, you got a long road.
1875.34s - 1880.46s |  You've got to get a little more creative and do a little more. Some things are easy. Yeah,
1880.46s - 1885.18s |  there's a few. Sometimes things are really simple, but sometimes they're not. You've got to go a
1885.18s - 1889.10s |  little farther and the scanners may not point it out to you. You may have to start thinking
1889.10s - 1896.14s |  through it and get a little more creative. I kind of started taking things a little
1896.14s - 1903.10s |  seriously and I was delving into more impactful findings and blogs by other researchers,
1903.10s - 1909.02s |  learning from the community, and exploring other pen test reports, excellently written reports
1909.02s - 1915.58s |  to figure out what's actually going wrong from my end, and adapting the platforms,
1915.58s - 1926.38s |  how platforms are working, what are the target rotations, and what programs are less eyes and
1926.38s - 1934.70s |  what programs has more eyes. Obviously, the CTF and labs are quite helpful because
1934.70s - 1941.82s |  you will get to learn how the exploits is working. The one more thing, the one target,
1941.82s - 1949.42s |  you have to target one at a time, so you will get a better idea about how the target is working and
1950.22s - 1956.54s |  how their business logic is. Yeah, so learning from the community,
1956.54s - 1960.22s |  one of the big things I've seen, and I'm going to say something a little blasphemous right now,
1961.34s - 1964.30s |  if you come into bug bounty hunting and you're looking for the money,
1965.58s - 1970.22s |  you're probably going to have a hard road. If you come into it and say, I have paid thousands
1970.22s - 1975.34s |  on courses, I have paid thousands for school, and I paid a lot of money to get certifications,
1975.34s - 1980.38s |  this is free. You're going to be in the right mind space. Let the money come when it will,
1980.38s - 1985.18s |  right? That's a bonus. This is free training that you may actually get a little bit of money for.
1986.38s - 1989.98s |  As you start seeing that, you're going to start finding success. The people who I know who came
1989.98s - 1994.46s |  into it who said, I just want to sharpen my skills are very successful. The people who come
1994.46s - 1999.50s |  into it and immediately I'm like, I need to pay a bill next weekend. I need to have beer for Friday.
2000.14s - 2003.74s |  You're going to have a hard time. You're going to get frustrated. So come into it
2003.82s - 2010.30s |  mind space wise and say, I'm wanting to learn and use the community. Whether it is Discord,
2011.02s - 2015.58s |  the different channels that we have set up, we have Slack channels that you can actually just
2015.58s - 2019.98s |  reach out and say, hey, Nix, I'm kind of stuck. Now he's not going to go and say, hey, here's
2019.98s - 2024.62s |  a cross that script and go find it because he's also looking for it, right? But if you're stuck
2024.62s - 2028.62s |  and you have a good idea, you're like, I just don't have this payload. Where can I look for
2028.62s - 2033.98s |  more info? That's where you can reach out for help from the community. Nobody's going to give
2033.98s - 2039.26s |  you the free answer, but you can start getting, figure out how to get better. And you've got
2039.26s - 2045.02s |  access to world-class trainers because they are doing it. So reach out, educate yourself,
2045.02s - 2051.10s |  use this as an education tool, use the community. Each of the platforms has a community person
2051.74s - 2055.74s |  who is there to help you succeed. That's their job. So use that.
2056.54s - 2067.02s |  So in my previous point, I delve into target approach and platform adoption. So what I mean
2067.02s - 2074.38s |  to say from the platform adoption is, let's say H1, HackerOne and Buckrowd was accepting reports
2074.46s - 2081.82s |  on first come first services, but the other platform like Sennac is using a quality rule
2082.38s - 2090.14s |  during 2016 to 2023. And the quality rule is something like that, that you have, they choose
2090.14s - 2101.34s |  the best written report during that time. And even if you submitted last and the report is fine,
2101.34s - 2109.58s |  then they submit the last report on the basis of just the report writing. But this has been
2109.58s - 2117.42s |  remote now and they start using first come first serve only. So that is the platform adoption
2117.42s - 2128.62s |  because you have to know what is going on on the platform and how to work on the particular
2129.34s - 2134.86s |  platform. Yeah, each platform is a little different. And so when you're working with
2134.86s - 2139.42s |  them, make sure you know what your rules are. The first thing when you get on a platform,
2139.42s - 2145.50s |  read all the rules. And that's really kind of simple. I'll say this Sennac setup is fairly
2145.50s - 2150.38s |  complicated because you've got a VPN, you've got a VM, and you've got dedicated IPs that you're
2150.38s - 2155.90s |  coming from. When you're going with some others, maybe you need to note, I'm a researcher in there
2155.90s - 2160.46s |  because you're not on that secured network. They don't know who you are. And you're sending
2160.46s - 2165.42s |  attack traffic and live target guys. If they don't know who you are, that may alarm them.
2165.42s - 2169.66s |  So go and find out the rules. Make sure you're really clear before you go start sending attack
2169.66s - 2174.22s |  traffic and figure out which platform works for you. There is no one answer. There is different
2174.22s - 2178.54s |  platforms because they have different strengths and weaknesses. So find out what works for you.
2178.54s - 2184.38s |  And a lot of people work on all of them. There's no downside to that. One interesting note,
2184.38s - 2190.62s |  even though the quality rule, the QR is now not a thing. The reason why that happened was to make
2190.62s - 2198.38s |  sure that the reports had good quality and that they were written well. So you go back to remember
2198.38s - 2203.42s |  what I said about write the report well. That was what we were trying to get out there. So it was
2203.42s - 2209.34s |  that important that we actually had an entire rule around this and have platform-based stuff on it.
2209.34s - 2214.14s |  So just remember that the triage is going to very favorably respond to that good report writing.
2215.02s - 2224.70s |  So when I have all of this in mind and I refine my skills, I actually able to find some good
2224.70s - 2233.58s |  vulnerabilities starting from the HelloSign one. This was found in 2015. It was straight
2234.62s - 2241.18s |  an SSRF that is called through the event callback functionality. And I was able to
2241.18s - 2250.86s |  call back their past WD file. So and the Microsoft started their bug bounty program
2250.86s - 2261.18s |  for online services in 2014, late 2014. I submitted multiple reports and 90% reports
2261.18s - 2273.58s |  got accepted while 10% got duplicate only. So I was pretty fast. I understand what to do
2274.46s - 2282.30s |  for a particular program. And I target only one program at a time. And I focus more on
2282.86s - 2292.62s |  high-impact vulnerabilities. And then later I got listed into MSRC top 100 and also
2293.98s - 2303.39s |  awarded with this laptop. Then I came in full-time pursuit because I created a
2303.39s - 2309.87s |  financial backup out of whatever bug bounties I have got. I stepped away from 9-to-5 job.
2310.43s - 2318.83s |  And I turned into the full-time bug bounty hunter. So that's how you can start being a
2318.83s - 2325.63s |  full-time bug bounty hunter. You create a backup for yourself. And then only you can step away
2325.63s - 2334.91s |  from a daily job and start doing a full-time bug bounty. Because bug bounty has a lot of money.
2334.91s - 2341.71s |  But it also gives you a lot of stress too. Yeah. So one thing I'll say is that we've noticed
2341.71s - 2346.83s |  that first of all, he started incorporating these techniques of listening, improving his reporting,
2346.83s - 2351.95s |  focusing, and starting to see success. One thing really important to notice, and I've told people
2351.95s - 2355.55s |  this a lot of times, if you're going to go out and Saturday you're going to go, yep, I'm going
2355.55s - 2358.91s |  to go bug hunt. I'm going to spend four hours on it. And I'm going to do a few hours on Sunday
2358.91s - 2364.27s |  and see what happens. Your odds of success are almost zero, okay? If that's your first time
2364.27s - 2369.23s |  out there, it's going to take you a while, guys. Average vols come in. Your first average vol is
2369.23s - 2374.27s |  20 hours of research, okay? But then as he said, it keeps getting faster. Then it becomes 10. Then
2374.27s - 2378.11s |  it becomes five. Then it becomes two. Then it becomes 30 minutes. Then it becomes 10 minutes
2378.11s - 2384.11s |  to find a single lie. But you have to put in the time. If you're planning on doing this, I'd say
2384.11s - 2389.95s |  there's a 40-hour rule here. Then if you're going to have a 98% chance of success, plan on spending
2389.95s - 2396.67s |  40 hours dedicated and have most of it on one to two targets. Get to know that thing really well.
2397.47s - 2401.87s |  You know, spend that 40 hours, then assess whether this is for you or not. Because if you quit too
2401.87s - 2406.67s |  soon, you're not going to really benefit from it. You've got to be persistent. You're going to start
2406.67s - 2411.31s |  doing that and start seeing income coming in. Now, you may have a little shoebox of income
2411.31s - 2415.95s |  that you're like, okay, I'm making enough to take my family to a really nice dinner this month.
2415.95s - 2421.39s |  That's what I got off bug bounty is that really nice dinner, you know, great steakhouse, great.
2421.95s - 2425.63s |  And you may be happy with that. Maybe that's the, you want the little bucket that's enough
2425.63s - 2431.87s |  to make a car payment. Maybe you start realizing it's getting bigger. We had one of our analysts,
2432.91s - 2437.87s |  really bright guy, senior analyst, paid him fairly well, of course. And he was bug hunting on the
2437.87s - 2444.59s |  side. And on very limited, very hardened targets, we started seeing he was making a lot of money
2444.59s - 2450.19s |  to the point that he was making more as a bug hunter than he was as a full-time security analyst.
2450.19s - 2453.23s |  And everybody asked him, why don't you quit? He goes, well, I like this, you know,
2453.23s - 2458.51s |  guaranteed income, right? Okay. Fair enough. Finally, he got to the point that, and he had
2458.51s - 2464.43s |  the money bank back sitting in the bank to float him for a while. But he realized that he was
2464.43s - 2469.47s |  actually losing money by working full-time as a security analyst. And that was when he decided
2469.47s - 2476.27s |  to quit and go full-time. So wait on the money and use the education time and start watching
2476.27s - 2480.27s |  where that bucket of money is doing, how often it comes in, and then you can make those decisions.
2480.99s - 2486.91s |  Please do not jump off next week and go, I'm that good. I've got my OSCP. I've got my OSCE.
2486.91s - 2491.15s |  I'm going to become a full-time bounty hunter because that very well may turn out to be a
2491.15s - 2495.47s |  very bad financial decision. Even if you're the best out there, you've got to have some
2495.47s - 2499.87s |  time to figure out what is your income going to look like from this. And so use that time to spin
2499.87s - 2504.35s |  up and figure that out. And that's when you can start stepping aside from the nine to five with
2504.35s - 2510.91s |  this. So when you've got motivation and some confidence, you can do better in the longer
2510.91s - 2519.79s |  terms, but you need to back by some good findings in order to keep those, keep those bounty hunter
2520.19s - 2528.75s |  running. So I'm moving on to some key discoveries that I've found during my bug bounty hunting.
2529.63s - 2537.47s |  A couple of them, like first one is a SQL injection in a biggest e-commerce solution
2537.47s - 2548.75s |  in the world. So you can guess about it. So I was onboarded on a target at this e-commerce solution
2548.83s - 2563.14s |  and while modifying the profile, I came across a country ID. And just a second. Okay. Sorry. I
2563.14s - 2575.97s |  think this slide, I don't know how it comes. So yeah. So it was an online car marketplace.
2575.97s - 2587.73s |  And I start, so I started running brute force on directories and files. And the application
2587.73s - 2595.65s |  keep redirecting me to the login page on each directory and file brute force. Like that.
2596.61s - 2608.77s |  Each hit getting redirected to 302 and it was kind of loop. And I tried to change the methods,
2608.77s - 2616.37s |  but I got the same result out of it. So what I do, I notice the application is using a third
2616.37s - 2625.01s |  party solutions. So what I do, I went to the third party solution and found it was a hosted
2625.49s - 2636.29s |  invoice solution they are using. So what I do, I went ahead and see if there are any demo version
2636.29s - 2641.41s |  available of the application. I couldn't find any demo version available anywhere.
2641.41s - 2654.13s |  So what I did, I did a subdomain brute force of the third party provider. And I found a demo
2654.13s - 2664.69s |  version running. And the demo version, these are all the demo version that are available for that
2664.69s - 2675.49s |  application. And after exploring a bit, and watching the YouTube videos, I found that once,
2676.45s - 2695.10s |  I mean, there was a, I found like, I was looking for a path from the application, which I couldn't
2695.10s - 2704.06s |  get. But after getting the demo version of it, I found that the application do not have any
2704.06s - 2714.94s |  authentication, but it was totally unauthenticated. They have added some rules in the path that was
2714.94s - 2723.02s |  denying me to actually accessing the direct path in the application. So what I did, I just
2724.70s - 2733.18s |  used that demo version to retract all the paths. And I just changed the domain name from the
2733.18s - 2741.42s |  application. And I started fuzzing for SQLi vulnerability on all the parameters that has been
2741.42s - 2752.22s |  into, that has been used into the application. And I found that I was able to dump all of their
2753.02s - 2765.74s |  databases because one parameter was vulnerable to SQLi. Then this is one of the banking asset that
2766.62s - 2776.86s |  I got. So what they're doing that they are fetching one JavaScript file from a CDN file name
2776.86s - 2789.10s |  parameter. And what I did, so CDN file name takes file input from file input such as user
2789.50s - 2799.90s |  underscore tools.bundle. So in the comment, I have seen there was a comment that the file comment,
2799.90s - 2811.02s |  which is having an API.github.com. And that user underscore tools.bundle was printed in that
2811.02s - 2819.50s |  particular path. So I thought that let's do one thing. That's user dot dot slash to come on to
2819.50s - 2836.86s |  the root path and then try to use API.github.com to query the internal data from the GitHub API.
2837.66s - 2849.02s |  So I just used their events query and I was able to dump their internal events, all the events
2850.38s - 2861.18s |  from the CDN file parameters only. Because the dot dot slash was taking all the file path to
2861.18s - 2867.02s |  API.github.com only. Do you want to add something?
2867.98s - 2872.22s |  Right now, this is your vault. So I'm going to let you go with that. You know, some of the things
2872.22s - 2876.62s |  that I'm thinking about in the back of my head right now is just the persistence. And some of
2876.62s - 2881.74s |  the things that we're kind of looking at is how do we succeed? You know, and so I'd say the
2881.74s - 2886.70s |  persistence, keeping at it, learning, those are some of your key takeaways for how you start doing
2886.70s - 2892.86s |  this and how you start making money. How do we start succeeding in bug bounty? And just understanding
2892.86s - 2898.06s |  that there is a learning path. So that's kind of where I'm thinking right now. But keep running
2898.06s - 2905.34s |  with the bolts, man. I always like bolts. So this was an account takeover vulnerability.
2905.34s - 2913.10s |  So after doing subdomain discovery, I stumbled across a subdomain and it was giving a 403
2913.82s - 2921.50s |  forbidden error. So the 404 written error looks interesting to me. So what I did, I just did
2922.14s - 2928.38s |  quick Google search. And it was listing out a lot of applications. But one of the applications
2928.38s - 2935.90s |  looks interesting. So but it was asking for some deviant ID, which I do not know because
2936.70s - 2945.66s |  that is some unique thing. So I searched everywhere deviant ID was not available anywhere.
2946.06s - 2954.70s |  So I just did a simple, simple Google search on deviant ID on images, images section,
2954.70s - 2963.98s |  and I got I got some jumbo.com having a lot of contract IDs available under the
2964.94s - 2974.06s |  under under the papers and they have them as a deviant ID as as a deviant ID field.
2974.78s - 2982.38s |  So I collected those all all those deviant IDs from the Google images section on the and all
2982.38s - 2989.90s |  those all those images are available on some jumbo.com site. I don't know how to how to get it.
2990.38s - 2997.26s |  So I so I in the in the subject section, they have a lot of these deviant IDs available. I
2997.26s - 3004.38s |  use those deviant IDs. And I went to the application, I just use the forget password.
3004.38s - 3012.38s |  And I have seen that the the past the application was actually fetching the password for that
3012.38s - 3018.86s |  particular deviant ID and sending to me sending to the user in the plain text format in the in
3018.86s - 3025.10s |  one request itself. So I just use that particular password and deviant ID to log into the application.
3028.32s - 3032.72s |  So one thing I'm going to point out here is that you said something really interesting.
3032.72s - 3036.96s |  I didn't know what it was. So I started looking for it. Google it. Google is your friend, right?
3037.60s - 3040.64s |  I don't know how we would ever begin to hack before Google was what it is now.
3042.08s - 3045.84s |  A lot of your time is going to be spent researching. Nobody in this room knows
3045.84s - 3049.84s |  everything about everything in cyber. And if you think you do, I would love to talk to you.
3051.68s - 3054.96s |  Look at these things. When you see something you don't understand, take a curiosity.
3054.96s - 3059.68s |  I many times I've seen something that I've been like, OK, what is it? All of a sudden,
3059.68s - 3064.64s |  I find out that is a key piece of information that is not supposed to be shared. This is a
3064.64s - 3068.64s |  private something that is really sensitive. All of a sudden, I can start finding a way.
3068.64s - 3072.96s |  These are used for that. Really? OK, now I'm interested that parameter.
3072.96s - 3077.84s |  That was just something weird beforehand. So take the time to really understand the apps.
3078.64s - 3082.72s |  This is why earlier we said stop. Look at that one target. Get to know it.
3083.36s - 3088.72s |  Go and spend five, 10 hours on that target to really know it in depth. And part of that's
3088.72s - 3091.76s |  just going to be your research time to understand what all these parameters are.
3092.32s - 3095.52s |  DVM means something. They didn't just come up with that randomly.
3096.24s - 3100.08s |  So what is it? What are they trying to communicate with that number? Understand that,
3100.08s - 3103.68s |  and you're going to have a lot better chance of success and finding the right places to
3103.68s - 3108.72s |  manipulate and poke. So when you said I went and I Googled it, I wasn't familiar with it,
3108.72s - 3113.04s |  that's part of that time we said spend a lot of time on that target. Use that curiosity.
3113.68s - 3117.44s |  Of course, a lot of them are going to be nothing interesting. But it's when you find that one
3117.44s - 3121.60s |  interesting that you're like, oh, really, that whole parameter crawls the entire account for
3121.60s - 3128.16s |  admins. Interesting. Now I want to play with that one. So it's going to help you focus whenever you
3128.16s - 3132.16s |  start doing these researches on things you don't understand and see it's kind of weirdness.
3132.80s - 3140.96s |  This was another one was an SSR of an ASM solution. The target launched and there was no
3140.96s - 3148.08s |  vulnerability submitted on it. No vulnerability accepted on it. So this makes me curious why.
3148.08s - 3155.28s |  So I started digging into the application. So what application is doing? It starts doing
3155.84s - 3162.32s |  recon for subdomain IP address and all the certs. And it also creates a screenshot of
3162.32s - 3168.00s |  a parent domain too. So I got interested that if it is creating a screenshot of that parent too,
3168.88s - 3181.92s |  maybe I can use maybe I can use some domains and redirect that domains to my custom payload.
3181.92s - 3191.36s |  And that custom payload might comes up might extract some information from their internal
3192.24s - 3203.36s |  system and capture it as a screenshot. So what I did, I so that is their application. And
3203.84s - 3214.16s |  they're just creating a screenshot of whatever application is. So what I did, they were using
3215.84s - 3224.80s |  Amazon. Amazon has infrastructure services. So what I did, I just put this and tried to extract
3225.20s - 3239.60s |  the data from their screenshots. So that's how the screenshot is. It was all empty. There was
3239.60s - 3250.56s |  nothing on it. So I was curious that why it's not coming as a screenshot. So I was researching
3250.56s - 3257.52s |  more on this application and I found out that they are not using an EC2 but they are using the
3257.52s - 3267.76s |  Lambda. So I went to the Twitter and I searched for what exactly the what how exactly I can do
3267.76s - 3276.08s |  SSR with the Lambda. So I got a got a tweet that if you're if someone is using the Lambda function,
3276.08s - 3285.20s |  you can particularly use this particular request to actually query the internal data. So next I
3285.20s - 3294.48s |  created another redirect request and it actually it actually extracting the data from the Lambda
3294.48s - 3304.88s |  function as a screenshot. So I again passed it into for the execution. And what I did, it
3304.88s - 3312.96s |  actually captures their Lambda, Lambda, whatever Lambda event is running internally as a screenshot.
3313.68s - 3322.08s |  So that's these are all key discoveries that I found in this solution.
3322.64s - 3326.24s |  So as we're getting to write up, there's been one question that I've asked you before,
3326.24s - 3330.24s |  but I thought it was really kind of an interesting answer. And I think a lot of people here,
3331.12s - 3338.88s |  you are globally known, you're on the Microsoft Hall of Fame, SYNAC Legends, you do well. We're up
3338.88s - 3344.24s |  here today. Talk to me a little bit about imposter syndrome. Do you have it still?
3345.36s - 3351.84s |  Yeah, I mean, I regularly I mean, if you go to go to Twitter, and you will find a lot of bug bounty
3352.64s - 3360.96s |  tips. So you will get those imposter syndrome because, because looking at those, because,
3361.84s - 3367.60s |  I mean, you will find someone like, like, you must you must be missing something, you must be
3367.60s - 3374.80s |  missing something out from somewhere. I mean, someone is more skilled than you, and you are
3374.80s - 3381.04s |  lacking some some of the skills because they are getting more bounties, more impactful bugs. So
3381.04s - 3386.00s |  obviously that that's coming out and into your mind, but maybe that person has,
3387.60s - 3394.08s |  has been doing like research from last three, four months, and then he found that impactful
3394.08s - 3399.60s |  vulnerability. So it's, it's depends on total situation. And you do not have to panic from that.
3400.72s - 3404.32s |  I think that's the key there is don't panic just because you missed something or because
3404.32s - 3410.80s |  you didn't succeed. It doesn't mean you're wrong, right? It just means that, hey, let's keep going.
3410.80s - 3414.64s |  You know, and I think one of the things you said on that one time that really stuck with me,
3414.64s - 3420.08s |  and was that you woke up in the morning and kind of goes, am I really here? Am I? This is what I'm
3420.08s - 3427.04s |  doing for my job. And you get scared. And he said, you sit down, start typing, start working,
3427.04s - 3431.20s |  start to get in that mindset, life starts running well, okay, things are going good. Now find a flaw
3431.20s - 3434.72s |  now find a second flaw. You know, things are getting rejected, things are getting accepted
3434.72s - 3438.72s |  things. All that's going on any of the day you go, yeah, I got this. And the next morning,
3438.72s - 3444.40s |  you wake up and feel like you're fake again. Yeah. So I can say this, that stuck with me,
3444.40s - 3448.40s |  because I'm like, if he's doing it, then it's not a problem. If I'm doing it, too. These are
3448.40s - 3453.20s |  normal things for us, especially when you add the full time aspect of bug bounty and the pressure.
3453.84s - 3461.28s |  So just understand that the middle game is a lot in it. And the persistence and understanding that's
3461.28s - 3467.12s |  where you're going to succeed in bug bounty is by being mental, persistent, smart, intelligent,
3467.12s - 3471.60s |  go after it. Because yeah, you're competing against him, but he's also here to help you.
3472.56s - 3480.56s |  So like, like, Charlie said that there are a lot of a lot of challenges while running the long,
3480.56s - 3486.56s |  long time into bug bounties. So imposter syndrome is one of them, then if you are,
3486.56s - 3493.36s |  if you're, if you're not earning one or two months, you will start doubting yourself that
3493.36s - 3500.56s |  then the burnouts comes in. And the frustration of if reports are rejecting or getting duplicated,
3500.56s - 3507.52s |  the frustration comes comes in as well. And all of these comes as a stress on you. So
3508.40s - 3514.16s |  mental, your mental health gets impacted. So we're getting the signal to wrap it up, I think.
3515.20s - 3520.64s |  Yeah, he's not back there. So we will have these slides posted. So you can go through see some of
3520.64s - 3525.60s |  the details on this and cover it. But I think the basic thing is number one, treat this like a game.
3526.16s - 3530.64s |  Understand that it's a puzzle on that puzzle and try and just keep it in that mindset.
3531.20s - 3537.36s |  Treat it as fun training and enjoy the process. Keep at it. You're going to get success if you
3537.36s - 3541.60s |  keep at it. It's one of those things, the more you work at it, the more likely you are to succeed.
3543.20s - 3548.40s |  Anything else to add? All right. Well, thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Hope you had a good time.
