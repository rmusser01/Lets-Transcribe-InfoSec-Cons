**Introduction to Safety and Security in Aviation Systems**
- Presenter: Lillian Ash Baker, Product Security Engineer at Boeing and Whisk Aero
- Focus: Interplay of safety and security in aviation systems development
- Emphasis on standards and certification

**Safety Standards and Principles**
- **Formalization of DO-178**: Software considerations in airborne systems certification since 1981
- **Advisory Circular 25-1309-1A**: Outlines failure conditions and probabilities
- Probabilities: Classified as probable, improbable, extremely improbable
- Definitions: Minor, Major, Hazardous, Catastrophic
- **Design Assurance Levels (DAL)**: Major component in system development
  - Example: DAL-C system has a major effect on operation with remote failure probability

**Functional Hazard Assessments**
- Assessment of failure conditions and their impact on system functionality
- Standards include DO-178, DO-254, DO-278, ARP-4754
- Development objectives rather than specific development methods
- **Regulatory Bodies**: FAA (USA), EASA (Europe)

**Cybersecurity in Aviation Systems**
- **DO-356A**: Defines cybersecurity development objectives
- **Intentional, Unauthorized, Electronic Interactions (IUEI)**: Concept in cybersecurity
- **Security Assurance Levels (SAL)**: Not directly tied to DAL; assess threat vectors

**Safety and Security Integration**
- Safety focuses on “what and why,” security on “who and where”
- Intersection in the "how" of events and mitigations
- Importance of understanding non-linear system effects and unintended interactions

**Case Study: System Analysis**
- Example systems: A, B, C, and user display
- Functional hazardous assessment for DAL B systems
- Cybersecurity mitigations: Hashing memory, DDoS protection, secondary thread for cross-checking

**Challenges and Interactions**
- Safety and security must be developed together to ensure system integrity
- Potential negative interactions between safety and security measures
- Importance of comprehensive system requirements for a balanced security posture

**Conclusion**
- **Evolution of Systems**: From federated to highly integrated systems
- Importance of cybersecurity as systems become more interconnected
- Goal: Achieving both safe and cyber-secure systems in aviation
