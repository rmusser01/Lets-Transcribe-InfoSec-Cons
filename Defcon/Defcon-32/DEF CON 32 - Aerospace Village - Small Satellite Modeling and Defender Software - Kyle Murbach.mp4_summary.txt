**Introduction to Small Satellite Modeling and Defender Software**
- Presented by Dr. Kyle Merbach from the University of Alabama in Huntsville
- Partnership with U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command
- Focus on small satellite modeling, testing for vulnerabilities, and developing defense software

**Dr. Kyle Merbach's Background**
- Principal research engineer at UAH CCRE since 2020
- Experience in malware analysis, tool development, reverse engineering, and vulnerability analysis
- Ph.D. in cyber operations from Dakota State University
- B.S. and M.S. in computer security from Rochester Institute of Technology
- Technical director of the space testing and resiliency simulation team

**Project Overview and Milestones**
- Ongoing since fall of 2019 with student teams
- Development of a small satellite testbed to model real-world functioning satellite systems
- Focus on identifying vulnerabilities and creating test scenarios
- Development of Small Satellite Defender software
- Presentation at U.S. Cyber Command Cyber Recon Symposium and collaboration with Lockheed Martin

**Purpose and Goals**
- Create a testbed for small satellite systems to perform research experiments
- Inform better defense strategies against cybersecurity threats
- Emulate real-world satellite operations with payload, communication, and data processing capabilities

**Hardware and Software Development**
- Considered Raspberry Pi 4 and Pi Cubed version 4 for testbed development
- Chose Raspberry Pi due to ease of acquisition and modification
- Developed a satellite-ground station communication setup with Raspberry Pi cameras and FM69ACW radios
- Utilized SenseHat add-on board for sensors and orientation control
- Simulated satellite orbits using Cesium Orbit software

**Attack Scenarios and Prevention**
- Explored various attack scenarios including man-in-the-middle, denial of service, and hardware attacks
- Developed mitigation strategies such as command validation and health checks
- Focused on preventing unauthorized satellite access and data manipulation

**Small Satellite Defender Development**
- Creation of lightweight software to monitor and protect satellites
- Incorporation of malware scanning, network checks, and secure configuration
- Successful experimentation and deployment on an actual orbiting satellite with Lockheed Martin

**Current and Future Work**
- Working on interorbital system TubeSats for further experimentation
- Integration of Small Satellite Defender in real-world satellites
- Development of new iterations focusing on ground station and satellite security
- Collection and visualization of satellite metrics for enhanced security monitoring
