**Introduction to Leveraging AI for Bug Bounties**
- Presentation at DEF CON 32 Bug Bounty Village
- Focus on how AI can enhance the bug bounty and security fields
- Speakers: Diego Jurado, Joel Niemand, Sec Noguera

**AI's Role in Security**
- AI can improve daily security tasks
- AI is capable of automating routine tasks
- Questions about AI's potential in offensive security

**Capabilities of AI in Bug Bounties**
- AI can mimic human bounty hunters
- Skills like intuition and creativity are crucial for human bounty hunters
- AI can apply learnings from past experiences

**Example of AI in Action**
- AI agent demonstrated on a JWT Python implementation
- Agent performs reconnaissance, processes outputs, and learns
- Handles tasks like changing content types and logging cookies

**Challenges and Learnings**
- AI can make mistakes similar to human errors
- AI's adaptability in different situations
- Importance of understanding tools and exploiting methods

**Research and Development**
- Initial research identified limitations in AI models
- Challenges with scaling AI findings to the real world
- Need for more complex and diverse benchmarks

**Expo's Approach**
- Expo's method involved collecting extensive benchmarks
- Collaboration with companies like Postfigure and Pendester Labs
- Creation of a fully autonomous AI agent

**Performance and Results**
- High success rate in solving challenges from various labs
- AI solved 75% of benchmarks without human intervention
- Focus on web application challenges

**Vulnerability Distribution in Benchmarks**
- Realistic distribution of vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting and IDORS
- Inclusion of server-side forgery, injections, and privilege escalation

**Sharing and Future Developments**
- Plan to share benchmarks publicly
- Aim to improve AI's success rate in certain categories

**Comparative Experiment with Human Pen Testers**
- Experiment comparing AI with human pen testers
- AI performed better in some scenarios, faster than humans
- Human creativity remains superior in complex cases

**AI as a Second Brain or Assistant**
- Exploration of AI as a support tool for human testers
- Concept of human in the loop providing real-time feedback
- Prototype development for enhanced AI-human interaction

**Conclusion and Team Acknowledgment**
- AI shows promise in specific areas but needs improvement in complex scenarios
- Expo team's collective effort over three months
- Potential for AI to assist human testers in the future
