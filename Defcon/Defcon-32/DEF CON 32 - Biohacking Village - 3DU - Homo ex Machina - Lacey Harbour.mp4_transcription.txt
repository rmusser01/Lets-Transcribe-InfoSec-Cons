0.24s - 5.24s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Thank you so much for coming to my talk.
5.24s - 7.24s |  If you'd like to, I have some detailed slides,
7.24s - 10.24s |  so if you'd like to get into those details,
10.24s - 12.24s |  please feel free to click the QR code.
12.24s - 13.24s |  I promise it's safe.
13.24s - 16.24s |  I don't know how to make it not safe, so.
16.24s - 20.24s |  And follow along for your use.
20.24s - 21.24s |  My name is Lacey Harbour.
21.24s - 24.24s |  I have a background in molecular biology,
24.24s - 26.24s |  but fell, unfortunately or fortunately,
26.24s - 29.24s |  into regulatory and quality and clinical studies.
29.24s - 34.24s |  And today, I want to present some ideas to everyone here
34.24s - 38.24s |  about how medical devices are being made
38.24s - 41.24s |  and how they're going to be made in the future.
41.24s - 43.24s |  And during this process,
43.24s - 46.24s |  I'm going to highlight some areas of concern
46.24s - 50.24s |  that is particularly applicable to our cybersecurity partners
50.24s - 53.24s |  and how we're not really ready for the future
53.24s - 57.24s |  of the medical device world.
57.24s - 63.24s |  So, it goes without saying that AI is changing everything.
63.24s - 67.24s |  AI is particularly changing the healthcare ecosystem.
67.24s - 71.24s |  And this is a good thing for us
71.24s - 74.24s |  because us as a population, we're aging.
74.24s - 77.24s |  And our population isn't growing with new members
77.24s - 79.24s |  as much as it used to.
79.24s - 84.24s |  With that, we're going to need a new point of care,
84.24s - 87.24s |  new care, standard of care treatments.
87.24s - 91.24s |  And that's not going to be doable without AI.
91.24s - 96.24s |  So, AI being integrated into the products
96.24s - 98.24s |  are changing the scope of these products.
98.24s - 100.24s |  And my world is regulatory.
100.24s - 104.24s |  We like to bucket products into regulated and unregulated product.
104.24s - 107.24s |  You can have the exact same instrument or device or whatever.
107.24s - 111.24s |  And if you define it to be intended for a medical purpose,
111.24s - 113.24s |  like diagnosis, it's a medical device.
113.24s - 117.24s |  So, you have all these controls in place to deal with that product,
117.24s - 120.24s |  to develop it, to manage it, to monitor it.
120.24s - 123.24s |  But if it's not a medical device,
123.24s - 126.24s |  then you don't have to monitor it to the same level of scrutiny.
126.24s - 131.97s |  And that can be a concern.
131.97s - 135.97s |  So, when something's called a medical device,
135.97s - 140.97s |  particularly in the U.S., it's all depending on its intended use.
140.97s - 143.97s |  Now, with the ecosystem changing,
143.97s - 145.97s |  with the scope of the products changing,
145.97s - 148.97s |  the intended use is not just the only thing we need to be worried about
148.97s - 150.97s |  or be mindful of.
150.97s - 154.97s |  We need to be mindful of how it's being used in the healthcare system,
154.97s - 158.97s |  what data sources and attributes it's plugging into.
158.97s - 160.97s |  Who are the end users?
160.97s - 162.97s |  It's not just the physician anymore.
162.97s - 165.97s |  There's different voice of customers that need to be paid attention to,
165.97s - 167.97s |  especially when you're building a product
167.97s - 174.97s |  that should be secure and safe and effective across the entire use
174.97s - 177.97s |  and its entire ecosystem.
177.97s - 183.97s |  In the past, I used to have to be worried just about the FDA in the U.S. market.
183.97s - 186.97s |  Now, I have to be mindful of all of these entities,
186.97s - 190.97s |  these regulatory entities that are listed on the screen.
190.97s - 193.97s |  And that's just the U.S. market.
193.97s - 195.97s |  I'm part of an FDA collaborative community.
195.97s - 197.97s |  I'm one of the co-leaders of it.
197.97s - 201.97s |  And we have an NLP that just scans the Internet,
201.97s - 205.97s |  picking up sources that we've deemed reliable
205.97s - 211.97s |  and allowing us to analyze all these global sources into a one-stop shop.
211.97s - 213.97s |  Within this year alone,
213.97s - 218.97s |  there have been 85 sources or materials that we,
218.97s - 220.97s |  as a regulatory equality partners,
220.97s - 224.97s |  must analyze and communicate to our companies to take action upon.
224.97s - 228.97s |  And I don't know if you really appreciate how much freaking work that is
228.97s - 230.97s |  and how damn near impossible that is.
230.97s - 232.97s |  Because not only do I have to analyze it,
232.97s - 235.97s |  and then I have to teach the executives this information,
235.97s - 239.97s |  then I have to get buy-in that they need to update procedures and policies.
239.97s - 242.97s |  We have to do a business risk impact and see how much, you know,
242.97s - 244.97s |  it just keeps going and going and going.
244.97s - 248.97s |  Ultimately, you have to train the people within the manufacturing line
248.97s - 250.97s |  even what they can and cannot do.
250.97s - 252.97s |  This is a huge task.
252.97s - 256.97s |  And, of course, it's going to be easier based on the size of your company,
256.97s - 257.97s |  or maybe not.
257.97s - 261.97s |  Each company has their own problems with this.
261.97s - 265.97s |  It's not just the regulatory ecosystem.
265.97s - 268.97s |  It's also the relationship with our customers.
268.97s - 270.97s |  So as medical device manufacturers,
270.97s - 274.97s |  you know, you always think the customer is the physician or the patient.
274.97s - 276.97s |  But that's not always the case.
276.97s - 280.97s |  We are plugging in our products into health delivery organizations.
281.97s - 285.97s |  And they have to navigate their own set of regulations,
285.97s - 287.97s |  and they have their requirements.
287.97s - 291.97s |  And so we have to make sure that our products interact with that.
291.97s - 294.97s |  Also, with the future of these products, again,
294.97s - 297.97s |  AI enablement is a really data-hungry process,
297.97s - 299.97s |  no matter where it's plugged into.
299.97s - 301.97s |  And who owns the data?
301.97s - 304.97s |  Well, the EHR companies like Epic.
304.97s - 307.97s |  You think they want to share that data with the medical device manufacturers
307.97s - 310.97s |  so that we can have good quality outputs?
310.97s - 311.97s |  Not necessarily.
311.97s - 315.97s |  So we have to build those relationships with the medical device manufacturers,
315.97s - 320.97s |  the EMR, and any other applications that are plugging in to the hospital
320.97s - 324.97s |  delivery organization or HDOs.
324.97s - 329.97s |  So FDA is seeing this, and I like to –
329.97s - 333.97s |  they're not the only agency globally that's really making progress,
333.97s - 336.97s |  but they are really being public about it, and it's accessible.
336.97s - 338.97s |  Any of you guys can go on the FDA website
338.97s - 342.97s |  and see all sorts of initiatives that they're putting into place
342.97s - 345.97s |  to make sure that the public is being heard.
345.97s - 347.97s |  And they're actually engaging patients, even.
347.97s - 350.97s |  They're really paying attention to the voice of customer
350.97s - 352.97s |  and how these products are truly used.
352.97s - 357.97s |  For example, you know, they'll even – they'll ask about, like,
357.97s - 360.97s |  the workflow in a laboratory, even.
360.97s - 365.97s |  And so I highly recommend and encourage everyone to go check out these resources.
365.97s - 368.97s |  So – but when the FDA is, in particular,
368.97s - 372.97s |  and they're working with an international group called the IMDRF,
372.97s - 378.97s |  when the FDA is hearing and seeing where the industry is going,
378.97s - 383.97s |  they try – they're trying to grow along with industry
383.97s - 386.97s |  so that they're not holding us back.
386.97s - 389.97s |  And one particular use case I'm going to talk to you guys about today
389.97s - 393.97s |  is called the medical device production system.
393.97s - 398.97s |  But before I can get into this future device, essentially,
398.97s - 401.97s |  I want to level set everybody.
401.97s - 406.97s |  Who's here familiar with the total product lifecycle?
406.97s - 408.97s |  I have a handful of people.
408.97s - 409.97s |  All right.
409.97s - 414.97s |  So the total product lifecycle is basically the inception of a product
414.97s - 417.97s |  all the way to the end of life of a product.
417.97s - 423.97s |  And so I put together here a representation of any kind of QMS
423.97s - 427.97s |  or quality management system that represents a total product lifecycle.
427.97s - 429.97s |  And it looks like a cell.
429.97s - 432.97s |  And I really – maybe the biologist is being a little biased in me,
432.97s - 436.97s |  but it really is like feedback loops, like what you get in a cellular function.
436.97s - 441.97s |  So you could break it down, in my mind, a total product lifecycle
441.97s - 444.97s |  into design controls, production and process controls,
444.97s - 446.97s |  and then there's feedback loops for improvements.
446.97s - 449.97s |  And any of those improvements could be like failure on the field.
449.97s - 451.97s |  It could be a non-conformance from a manufacturing line.
451.97s - 454.97s |  It could be a corrective action that's discovered from anything else
454.97s - 457.97s |  or regulatory updates.
457.97s - 462.97s |  But this is too complicated to really talk about and use.
462.97s - 467.97s |  So I further simplified the total product lifecycle schema
467.97s - 470.97s |  into these two basic buckets.
470.97s - 472.97s |  So you can see where I have the QMS,
472.97s - 475.97s |  and then I've broken it down to design controls
475.97s - 479.97s |  and production and process controls, where you have a prototype of a device.
479.97s - 485.97s |  It can be a digital device or a cyber device, as they call it in the U.S.
485.97s - 491.97s |  It could be a tongue depressor, depending on the classification.
491.97s - 496.97s |  But say that you have the prototype.
496.97s - 498.97s |  You test it. Hey, it's good.
498.97s - 502.97s |  I'm going to now scale up and manufacture this.
502.97s - 505.97s |  So then you transfer to manufacturing.
505.97s - 507.97s |  You test it. Hey, the manufacturing is working well.
507.97s - 511.97s |  Now we can actually start mass-producing these products.
511.97s - 514.97s |  And then you manufacture, and then you test it again.
514.97s - 518.97s |  And then finally, if they match all the quality control or QC checks,
518.97s - 523.97s |  that device is released out into the wild or software or whatever.
523.97s - 525.97s |  Within each of these steps, there's feedback loops.
525.97s - 530.97s |  So something bad can happen during this process to kick you all the way back
530.97s - 534.97s |  to design of feasibility and design phase.
534.97s - 538.97s |  But at the end of the day, the take-home message is the output,
538.97s - 543.97s |  the final device, is from that whole end-to-end total product lifecycle
543.97s - 547.63s |  within the QMS.
547.63s - 552.63s |  So now that I've kind of given you a very high level of the basics
552.63s - 556.63s |  of what currently exists, let's talk about the future.
556.63s - 561.63s |  The future of our products is going to be precise.
561.63s - 563.63s |  It's going to be personalized.
563.63s - 565.63s |  It's going to be at the point of care.
565.63s - 570.63s |  And there are several different industries and sectors and technologies
570.63s - 576.63s |  that are helping pushing our standard of care practice to this point.
576.63s - 585.63s |  But the orthopedic sector has really been leveraging the 3D printing technology
585.63s - 592.63s |  to bring us closer to that precise, personalized, and point-of-care product.
592.63s - 598.63s |  And I'm going to reintroduce the idea of a medical device production system to you.
598.63s - 603.63s |  And so this isn't the only use case involved that does this,
603.63s - 608.63s |  but these orthopedics, I guess because, I mean, to be honest,
608.63s - 613.63s |  it's human carpentry, so the complexity isn't as much as maybe other devices.
613.63s - 616.63s |  So they're moving at a very fast pace.
616.63s - 618.63s |  And the FDA saw that, and so did IMDRF.
618.63s - 621.63s |  So they've started to put together some loose guidelines
621.63s - 626.63s |  to help lead this medical device production system.
626.63s - 630.63s |  So what is the medical device production system, or MDPS?
630.63s - 634.63s |  So let's go back, again, to the schema I showed you all before.
634.63s - 638.63s |  Again, the output is a device, right?
638.63s - 642.63s |  It's pretty simple, of a total product lifecycle of the QMS.
642.63s - 647.63s |  Well, a medical production system turns that on its head.
647.63s - 652.63s |  Now the output, the device, isn't the final component.
652.63s - 655.63s |  And this is a little hard to wrap your head around.
655.63s - 657.63s |  It includes the manufacturing.
657.63s - 659.63s |  It includes the design phase.
659.63s - 663.63s |  So what happens is I'm a medical device manufacturer,
663.63s - 666.63s |  and I'm going to make a medical device production system, an MDPS.
666.63s - 671.63s |  I'm going to design the production line just as I would before,
671.63s - 676.63s |  except now I'm going to realize that this production system
676.63s - 680.63s |  is going to be part of the device in the health care delivery organization.
680.63s - 684.63s |  So there will be manufacturing in the hospital.
684.63s - 690.63s |  And then I will allow a certain range of scope or specs
690.63s - 693.63s |  that can be allowed for the hospital to manufacture.
694.63s - 697.63s |  And so from that end-to-end process, they can design the product,
697.63s - 699.63s |  and they can manufacture it,
699.63s - 702.63s |  and then the output is part of the entire device.
702.63s - 705.63s |  The output alone is no longer the singular device.
705.63s - 711.63s |  So if any of you are familiar with the quality system regulation
711.63s - 715.63s |  or 13485 standards, your wheels may be turning like,
715.63s - 717.63s |  how the hell do you control this?
717.63s - 719.63s |  And that is a big question.
719.63s - 724.63s |  But the precursors to this are existing right now.
724.63s - 732.63s |  Here I have an image of some 3D-printed EBM joint implants made.
732.63s - 736.63s |  They're called trabecular titanium, and they allow for bone engrowth.
736.63s - 738.63s |  And they are all patient-matched.
738.63s - 742.63s |  And these are printed in the hospital as we speak
742.63s - 745.63s |  from a medical device manufacturer.
745.63s - 752.63s |  And so I'm going to kind of introduce at a high level this current process,
752.63s - 755.63s |  and then we're going to talk about how this is going to become
755.63s - 758.63s |  the medical device production system.
758.63s - 761.63s |  So say I'm a patient.
761.63s - 764.63s |  I have a really janked-up shoulder.
764.63s - 768.63s |  And the physician says, hey, the standard products on the market,
768.63s - 770.63s |  they're not going to work for you.
770.63s - 772.63s |  We need to give you a custom device.
772.63s - 775.63s |  So they're going to send me to get a fresh CT scan.
775.63s - 777.63s |  I'm going to get my first CT scan,
777.63s - 781.63s |  and that DICOM file is going to go to the radiologist, to the surgeons,
781.63s - 786.63s |  and they're going to segment that file with the medical device manufacturer
786.63s - 789.63s |  or the designer.
789.63s - 793.63s |  They will identify the defects, and then they will agree
793.63s - 796.63s |  on how the physician wants to approach it.
796.63s - 802.63s |  The physician is really close with the designer through this whole process.
802.63s - 807.63s |  After they discuss it, the designer will then take that DICOM file
807.63s - 811.63s |  and convert it to an STL file within, like, a 3D CAD program like Magix
811.63s - 814.63s |  or something similar to that.
814.63s - 818.63s |  And they will propose potential designs,
818.63s - 820.63s |  and the designs don't come out of anywhere.
820.63s - 825.63s |  It's based off of historical data, recall data from standard devices,
825.63s - 828.63s |  but it will be matching how the physician wants to perform the surgery
828.63s - 831.63s |  and what the physician actually wants to do.
831.63s - 834.63s |  And so there's a feedback loop there until the physician gets the green light,
834.63s - 837.63s |  and then it is released.
837.63s - 842.63s |  But just because you can design something doesn't mean you can actually print it.
842.63s - 846.63s |  Within a 3D printer, there's XYZ zones,
846.63s - 849.63s |  and each zone has a different behavior.
849.63s - 851.63s |  They're their own animal.
851.63s - 856.63s |  So what happens is that the designer will give the STL file
856.63s - 858.63s |  to the production engineer,
858.63s - 860.63s |  and then they will convert it to a machine file
860.63s - 864.63s |  and determine if it's possible to actually 3D print that geometry.
864.63s - 866.63s |  And some of that may be tied to demand planning
866.63s - 870.63s |  because you obviously have a large bed,
870.63s - 874.63s |  and you may be printing more than one patient's devices at a time,
874.63s - 878.63s |  and so you may have to strategize that.
878.63s - 882.63s |  But it's not uncommon for that device to be kicked back to the physician, essentially,
882.63s - 886.63s |  if the production engineer says, no, we can't do that.
886.63s - 891.63s |  After it's printed, there are a lot of supports that need to be removed,
891.63s - 896.63s |  and so typically it's like a CNC or a saw that helps remove those products,
896.63s - 898.63s |  and then it goes to a QC check.
898.63s - 903.63s |  And the QC check is just not the outside dimension but the inside integrity.
903.63s - 907.63s |  These devices have to resist weight and movement,
907.63s - 912.63s |  and so if there's any kind of flaw internally, that can cause device failure.
912.63s - 916.63s |  So there's a lot of checks that have to be happened with QC samples.
916.63s - 924.91s |  So what might be of interest is let's dissect a little bit more detail of the first half of that
924.91s - 931.91s |  from the relationship of the health delivery organization and the medical device manufacturer.
931.91s - 936.91s |  I'm not going to go into all the detail of every bit of this schema,
936.91s - 942.91s |  but this is just a representation of what that data interaction might look like.
942.91s - 945.91s |  But what I really want to highlight, and I see some of you shaking your head
945.91s - 947.91s |  or maybe have some concerns.
947.91s - 950.91s |  You might have noticed that there's something called a PAC server,
950.91s - 955.91s |  and that holds all of the DICOM data for pretty much everything.
955.91s - 958.91s |  And how does that data get to the medical device manufacturer
958.91s - 961.91s |  will depend on the relationship the medical device manufacturer has
961.91s - 963.91s |  with the health delivery organization.
963.91s - 965.91s |  It could be a nurse downloading it.
965.91s - 969.91s |  It can be on a flash drive and handing it to the device manufacturer.
969.91s - 971.91s |  It could be an e-mail.
971.91s - 979.91s |  It could be a CD, or it could be connected directly into the medical device's server.
979.91s - 984.91s |  The medical device manufacturer may have a software that sits on top of the PAC server,
984.91s - 989.91s |  or they may have a relationship where they have access to the EMR.
989.91s - 993.91s |  And now if they have access to the EMR, they have to have a relationship with the EMR.
993.91s - 1000.91s |  So the problem is that I want to highlight is I just want to make a note
1000.91s - 1006.91s |  that medical device manufacturers are not HIPAA-covered entities.
1006.91s - 1011.91s |  And I'm just going to leave that there and let you kind of think on what that means.
1011.91s - 1023.91s |  So once the design is considered safe, at least from a failure mode analysis perspective,
1023.91s - 1027.91s |  then it goes back to the internally.
1027.91s - 1034.91s |  So now we're completely inside the medical device manufacturer's side of the network.
1034.91s - 1040.91s |  Many device manufacturers are moving forward to using what's called machine learning operations.
1040.91s - 1046.91s |  And this is just a high-level example of how that can look within the network.
1046.91s - 1052.91s |  You have the containers, of course, that are cross-talking with different instruments.
1052.91s - 1056.91s |  And then you can also have these containers cross-talking with other systems,
1056.91s - 1061.91s |  like your product lifecycle management system, your quality management system,
1061.91s - 1068.91s |  or your ERPs, or even other sites, if you have multiple sites interacting.
1068.91s - 1072.91s |  And that's something that would be a goal for medical device manufacturers with MDPS,
1072.91s - 1075.91s |  so it would be nice to have communications to see the success of the products
1075.91s - 1080.91s |  across all of your deployed MDPSs.
1080.91s - 1088.91s |  And so you can see here that there, again, you may be the design engineer.
1088.91s - 1090.91s |  How did you get the data from the designer?
1090.91s - 1092.91s |  Well, it could have been put up on a server.
1092.91s - 1094.91s |  It could have been a flash drive handed to you,
1094.91s - 1099.91s |  and you work on this product for the machine file, the machine planning,
1099.91s - 1102.91s |  on your personal laptop or on your work laptop,
1102.91s - 1106.91s |  because the data processing for this is quite substantial.
1106.91s - 1110.91s |  And then how does that data get to the EBM in the first place?
1110.91s - 1112.91s |  Again, it could be a flash drive.
1112.91s - 1118.91s |  There's a lot of flash drives used in manufacturing, especially with smaller firms.
1118.91s - 1124.64s |  So there's concerns there.
1124.64s - 1126.64s |  But this isn't MDPS.
1126.64s - 1130.64s |  This whole workflow that I presented, it's precursor to MDPS.
1130.64s - 1131.64s |  And it exists right now.
1131.64s - 1136.64s |  Here are just some firms that are doing this right now, and this isn't even all of them.
1136.64s - 1140.64s |  There's a lot of research going into how to get the MDPS.
1140.64s - 1144.64s |  And so what is the MDPS?
1144.64s - 1151.64s |  Well, just for simplicity purposes, think about that whole workflow and put it in a box.
1151.64s - 1152.64s |  You get the CT scan.
1152.64s - 1155.64s |  You plug that DICOM in this box.
1155.64s - 1157.64s |  There might be people remote, like designers
1157.64s - 1163.64s |  or even people monitoring the success of the instrument remotely.
1163.64s - 1168.64s |  And the physician is working with some kind of software interface to say,
1168.64s - 1171.64s |  hey, I want the design to look this way.
1171.64s - 1176.64s |  And then they press go, and out pops your final device.
1176.64s - 1178.64s |  Now, if anyone's familiar with 3D printing,
1178.64s - 1181.64s |  the post-processing is going to be a problem for the future MDPS,
1181.64s - 1185.64s |  but it's not going to be unattainable.
1185.64s - 1187.64s |  This is we are working.
1187.64s - 1188.64s |  Technology is being researched.
1188.64s - 1190.64s |  Mineralization is being researched.
1190.64s - 1195.64s |  This is not like it's going to be 50 years from now.
1195.64s - 1198.64s |  What's going to make this even more powerful is that you're going to have feedback
1198.64s - 1201.64s |  from the surgical suite into the MDPS.
1201.64s - 1203.64s |  So you're going to get clinical outcomes.
1203.64s - 1205.64s |  But, again, to get that, you have to have the relationship
1205.64s - 1208.64s |  with the medical device manufacturer.
1208.64s - 1214.89s |  So AI is going to be necessary to do this.
1214.89s - 1217.89s |  There's no way that you're not going to be able to have this without.
1217.89s - 1222.89s |  So let's highlight some of the areas where AI is being researched even right now
1222.89s - 1224.89s |  and where it's going to be plugged into this MDPS.
1224.89s - 1228.89s |  And, I mean, if you look this up online, you're going to see a slew of papers
1228.89s - 1230.89s |  because this is the low-hanging fruit.
1230.89s - 1234.89s |  Again, human carpentry, everyone's going for this.
1234.89s - 1237.89s |  First place, automatic segmentation.
1237.89s - 1241.89s |  Have a mask, highlight the defect, give you recommendations on the defect.
1241.89s - 1245.89s |  The radiologist, the surgeon, or whomever can look at that
1245.89s - 1248.89s |  and give yes or no feedback.
1248.89s - 1254.89s |  The next place is the design.
1254.89s - 1259.89s |  You can have all of your data from your field feedback,
1259.89s - 1263.89s |  from the designs that exist that are standard, to automatically generate design.
1263.89s - 1268.89s |  And all the designer has to do is say go, no-go,
1268.89s - 1270.89s |  and the physician have their inputs as well.
1270.89s - 1273.89s |  And you can use LLMs to generate the surgical technique,
1273.89s - 1277.89s |  which is also considered part of the labeling, which is part of the design
1277.89s - 1279.89s |  or the device.
1279.89s - 1285.89s |  Finally, the demand planning, the design transfer.
1285.89s - 1289.89s |  You can have multiple products in the queue,
1289.89s - 1295.89s |  and you can determine, hey, this device needs to be manufactured in this zone,
1295.89s - 1297.89s |  but this patient is suicidal, so they're a higher risk.
1297.89s - 1300.89s |  So that would adjust the demand planning.
1300.89s - 1304.89s |  And that's something, again, you need good connection with the physician
1304.89s - 1307.89s |  and the health HCPs to determine what's correct.
1307.89s - 1313.89s |  And then, of course, the enabling of manufacturing with ML is already in progress,
1313.89s - 1315.89s |  and they're just going to miniaturize that.
1315.89s - 1317.89s |  And it would make everything more visible,
1317.89s - 1322.89s |  and you can monitor the manufacturing in real time.
1322.89s - 1328.89s |  So I can't stress enough that maybe with the high-level schemas
1328.89s - 1332.89s |  that I presented to everybody, you might kind of detect that we, again,
1332.89s - 1336.89s |  are not ready for this, but the technology is getting there, and we need it.
1337.89s - 1338.89s |  We need it now.
1338.89s - 1340.89s |  We need it yesterday.
1340.89s - 1346.89s |  And so medical device manufacturers need to start being aware of the three customers
1346.89s - 1352.89s |  down the road so that we can have safe and effective products that are consented,
1352.89s - 1357.89s |  that are safe, that have encrypted, or private.
1357.89s - 1361.89s |  And that's not something medical device manufacturers are always mindful of.
1361.89s - 1367.89s |  We are really in a next-gen humanity moment here.
1367.89s - 1371.89s |  Here's an example of 3D printing autologous bone.
1371.89s - 1373.89s |  So you have a defect.
1373.89s - 1379.89s |  Instead of a joint implant, you 3D print a mold that's based off the defect,
1379.89s - 1382.89s |  and then you use a bioreactor to print your bone.
1382.89s - 1383.89s |  It's not just orthopedics.
1383.89s - 1385.89s |  It's just the low-hanging fruit.
1385.89s - 1390.89s |  I mean, the application is huge, and the MDPS is going to be amazing.
1390.89s - 1394.89s |  So we are in a Deus ex-human moment.
1394.89s - 1398.89s |  This is something I stole from my friend Nina, and it's true.
1398.89s - 1402.89s |  We are making new humans, and so how are we going to do this safe?
1402.89s - 1406.89s |  I encourage everyone to go to the resources I pointed out, kind of look at the schema.
1406.89s - 1412.89s |  What can you do to encourage this and where we can all, like, have a better future
1412.89s - 1415.89s |  and better healthcare practice and better standard of care?
1415.89s - 1417.89s |  So I appreciate everyone.
1417.89s - 1419.89s |  Thank you.
