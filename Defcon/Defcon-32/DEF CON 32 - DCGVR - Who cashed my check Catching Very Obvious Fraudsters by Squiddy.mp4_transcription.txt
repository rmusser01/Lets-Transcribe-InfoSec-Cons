3.06s - 7.90s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Squiddy is from DC-574 in South Bend, Indiana.
7.90s - 11.98s |  Squiddy is presenting, Who Cashed My Check?
12.46s - 14.70s |  Catching Very Obvious Fraudsters.
14.70s - 16.50s |  This should be really interesting.
16.94s - 20.34s |  When fraudsters target a small business, we do what we can to help.
20.98s - 26.70s |  Go on a quick, oscent adventure with Squiddy and learn about the simple steps taken
26.70s - 30.86s |  to connect the dots and locate small-time criminals with a history of forgery.
31.38s - 34.22s |  I'm very interested to hear about this because there was an incident
34.22s - 40.46s |  where somebody compromised my credit card account, and I actually tracked them down,
40.90s - 44.66s |  found out where they lived, had a picture of their house, had all the information,
44.94s - 47.10s |  gave it to the police, and they didn't do anything with it.
47.10s - 48.86s |  It was very frustrating.
49.70s - 56.30s |  Squiddy is founder of DC-574, is a transmasculine lesbian hacker, desktop engineer,
56.30s - 59.34s |  and small business owner from the cornfields of the Midwest.
60.10s - 66.58s |  They joined the hacker scene in 2017 as an OSINT newbie and founded DEFCON-574,
66.98s - 71.82s |  now merged with Michigan InfoSec in 2019 as a student organization
71.82s - 74.86s |  at Indiana University since 2017.
74.86s - 79.62s |  I believe your event, your meetings are held on campus, right?
79.62s - 87.74s |  Since 2017, they've given presentations at local tech meetups and at DEFCON covering various topics
87.78s - 92.90s |  from medical information systems to gender inclusivity and open-source intelligence.
93.22s - 96.70s |  So I'd like to welcome Squiddy to the stage once again and take it away, Squiddy.
97.90s - 98.90s |  This look good to everyone?
100.54s - 101.90s |  Yeah, that looks great.
101.90s - 105.26s |  Just to remind anybody, if they can't quite see the slides,
105.26s - 110.06s |  if you click on them, you can zoom in, and if you want to zoom out, you click to the left
110.06s - 114.14s |  or right of the slide in the frame, and it'll zoom back out.
117.44s - 118.04s |  It's all yours.
121.89s - 123.57s |  So hello, welcome to my talk.
124.57s - 125.81s |  Who cashed my check?
126.77s - 131.81s |  The theme for DEFCON this year is engage, and that means to engage with your community,
131.93s - 135.13s |  make helpful contributions, and create a supportive space.
135.69s - 139.13s |  What I really want to do with this talk is share a story of how I was able to make a difference
139.13s - 144.25s |  in my own community by making it a little bit safer in more than one regard.
145.45s - 147.13s |  Ooh, sorry, give me a second.
147.13s - 148.53s |  I had to run up here.
148.97s - 156.79s |  So by sharing the story, my goal is to encourage others to work on their community
157.07s - 158.95s |  and give what they can and really do the same.
159.35s - 161.71s |  Look for areas where you can make a difference and help out,
161.71s - 163.47s |  no matter how small you think that role is.
163.47s - 166.75s |  You're going to be making an intentional and meaningful contribution,
166.75s - 169.31s |  and it will make a difference in somebody's life.
169.67s - 172.27s |  So who am I?
172.59s - 177.79s |  I am an OSINT enthusiast, hacker, internet yapper, and former pandemic healthcare worker.
178.55s - 181.31s |  Currently, I work as a desktop engineer for a major hospital,
181.35s - 183.75s |  and I run my own little tech repair shop on the side
184.11s - 186.15s |  for the local community in Champaign, Illinois.
187.27s - 194.19s |  I did found DC574 in 2019 when I was in undergrad at South Bend
194.63s - 197.27s |  and then merged it with Michiana InfoSec in 2021.
197.83s - 201.19s |  I still kind of hang around, but right now I'm located in Champaign,
201.19s - 203.03s |  and I'm currently a graduate student as well.
203.79s - 208.71s |  This is my third time speaking at DCGVR, and I was honored to be invited back to speak this year.
209.35s - 212.99s |  The people who run DCGVR are fantastic, and they really go out of their way
212.99s - 216.07s |  to give the virtual space the same magic as the in-person DevCon.
216.99s - 221.67s |  It's really very special to be able to virtually step into this space each year in one way or another.
224.29s - 227.37s |  And if you hear me huffing and puffing, it's because I'm currently in Vegas
227.37s - 230.29s |  and might have a touch of the con crud, so forgive me for that.
231.81s - 234.33s |  So a little bit of background and self-promotion here.
234.73s - 239.09s |  The business I currently run is called Squid Eye, and it was formed in February of this year.
239.73s - 244.57s |  I founded the shop because a lot of the people in my life brought me their tech woes and asked for help.
244.89s - 249.13s |  They were afraid of being cheated or overcharged or told that nothing could be done to help them.
250.41s - 254.01s |  My clients are predominantly women, queer people, and individuals who are looking
254.01s - 258.97s |  for an affordable service and who would not have any other options to repair their devices.
259.89s - 263.09s |  In other words, I primarily aim to serve a marginalized population
263.09s - 265.41s |  and to be affordable and accessible to my community.
267.49s - 272.21s |  Squid Eye also functions as a sober, queer-friendly space and mini maker space,
272.45s - 274.41s |  because I and others in the community really feel
274.41s - 278.57s |  like there aren't enough queer safe spaces outside of bars.
281.25s - 285.45s |  I rent shop space at Bird Eater, which is a local queer art studio and hair salon
285.93s - 289.09s |  that is run by my friend Zed Boats, aka Bird Eater.
289.69s - 294.17s |  The studio is intentionally crafted with neurodivergent people in mind and is sensory friendly.
294.61s - 297.93s |  Zed cuts and colors hair in low lighting with fidgets and snacks,
298.29s - 301.81s |  and even occasionally makes trips out to people's houses to accommodate their needs.
302.53s - 307.13s |  They're amazing at vibrant colors, alt styles, and the gayest haircuts you can imagine,
307.13s - 309.73s |  and they're also a very talented mixed media artist.
312.02s - 315.62s |  So the business is more than just a simple repair shop tucked away in a corner.
315.70s - 320.50s |  Zed cuts my hair and sends me clients, and in return, I provide internet and sometimes catch things
320.50s - 324.90s |  on fire, which unfortunately is not a joke and has happened frequently enough
325.26s - 328.86s |  that my wife has now purchased a fire extinguisher just for my shop space.
329.78s - 332.94s |  But it's all good because I'm able to help people, and that's really the goal,
332.94s - 337.90s |  and that's what I tell myself, and I find that because of my OSINT background and willingness
337.90s - 343.82s |  to try fixing just about anything, clients bring me all sorts of tasks, problems, and questions.
344.62s - 348.58s |  I've been shocked more times than I can count, grabbed a live wire and had my hair,
348.58s - 353.06s |  eyelashes included, burnt off, accidentally set fire to many things in the shop,
353.06s - 356.58s |  been covered in broken glass, and have been nebulized after inhaling a fair bit
356.58s - 359.46s |  of spray paint during an art escapade at 2 a.m.
359.98s - 363.46s |  Doctor was not amused but did encourage me to keep creating, so kudos.
364.22s - 369.42s |  I've been asked to fix phones, collaborate on art projects, posters, plush toys, vacuums,
369.42s - 371.82s |  it's all ended up in my shop, design websites.
372.30s - 376.26s |  I've been asked to locate pedophiles with active arrest warrants and catch scammers,
376.26s - 379.62s |  and that last request is the request that I'll be talking about today.
382.37s - 385.81s |  I've worked on a handful of jobs before Squid Eye's official open date,
385.81s - 387.85s |  and I received some very positive reviews.
388.33s - 391.73s |  And in April of this year, I received an interesting request
391.73s - 395.81s |  from another local small business owner in town whose business had been targeted
395.81s - 399.73s |  by some small-time criminals, and she wanted my help in determining who the frauds were.
401.17s - 404.29s |  It all started when this business owner, we're going to call her Natalie,
404.29s - 406.77s |  received communication from her electric company
407.29s - 410.61s |  that her business was facing possible disconnection due
410.61s - 414.37s |  to her last payment not being received, despite Natalie attempting
414.37s - 417.49s |  to pay her electric company via the bank's mobile app.
418.01s - 419.21s |  Natalie called the bank.
419.21s - 424.45s |  The bank informed her that they had received electronic communication from the power company
424.45s - 430.53s |  that electronic payments were no longer being accepted, and that they were told to send a check
430.53s - 432.97s |  by mail, so the bank sent out a check.
434.45s - 438.33s |  When the electric company did not receive the check, the business had its power cut,
438.33s - 441.81s |  and Natalie, not wanting to experience a negative setback or dip in revenue,
442.13s - 445.17s |  acted fast to correct the issue and authorize another payment
445.17s - 446.85s |  to the electric company over the phone.
447.77s - 451.73s |  She assumed that the check that was already sent out would reach the company at a later date
451.73s - 454.93s |  and would be applied as credit to the business account for their next bill.
455.89s - 461.01s |  However, she received another notification about an upcoming payment the following month.
461.69s - 464.73s |  It turns out the check was never received by the electric company,
464.73s - 469.65s |  and no credit was posted to the business account, but the check was cashed, so who cashed it?
472.81s - 475.85s |  We needed to act fast and figure out the answer to that question.
476.21s - 479.57s |  Natalie had just found a new location for her business and invested quite a bit
479.57s - 482.33s |  of funds into making it an amazing space.
483.21s - 486.01s |  The business could struggle with another loss so soon if it turned
486.01s - 490.73s |  out that she was not targeted by chance, and was instead set up to be a continued target.
491.29s - 495.17s |  She could be re-victimized, and the individuals involved could move states,
495.17s - 500.57s |  change their names, or otherwise attempt to evade detection in law enforcement,
500.57s - 503.01s |  and this would leave them free to target other business owners.
503.97s - 507.65s |  So within about 48 hours, we had to determine who exactly was involved,
508.21s - 510.37s |  where they were located, and how they were connected.
511.01s - 515.45s |  Within that same timeframe, I had to compile information on the suspects and assist
515.45s - 518.25s |  in drafting a police report in a way that made things obvious
518.25s - 520.21s |  and easy to understand for law enforcement.
520.89s - 521.77s |  Time was ticking.
525.04s - 528.24s |  I had a few questions to ask myself to determine what I was dealing with.
529.04s - 532.92s |  Was Natalie's information gotten from phishing or social engineering tactics,
533.60s - 537.72s |  or is there an internal bad actor at the bank feeding information to these criminals?
538.24s - 540.76s |  Would this be a case of check washing or counterfeiting?
541.24s - 543.12s |  Who are the people involved in the crime?
543.12s - 545.28s |  How many people might be involved in the crime?
548.95s - 552.75s |  First, phishing, of course, is not a new social engineering tactic.
552.75s - 553.39s |  We know this.
554.63s - 559.75s |  A lot of companies fall prey to phishing, but most train their employees
559.75s - 560.99s |  against phishing attacks.
560.99s - 563.39s |  It's pretty well known now, and it's very possible
563.39s - 566.15s |  that a phishing attack fooled a bank employee.
566.15s - 569.35s |  It could also be an insider working at the bank who used an email
569.35s - 572.31s |  from the electric company as an excuse to cover up
572.31s - 576.39s |  for knowingly creating the counterfeit check, right, so we couldn't be certain.
576.87s - 579.79s |  We were never provided with proof of the electronic communication
579.79s - 582.55s |  from the electric company that was supposedly sent to the bank.
583.15s - 585.91s |  But another employee at the bank confirmed that there was a note
585.91s - 589.99s |  in the business owner's account regarding the electronic communication received.
590.27s - 594.87s |  Was phishing involved, or was a letter from the electric company just a cover-up story,
594.87s - 597.07s |  maybe crafted by a malicious bank employee?
597.79s - 605.60s |  So we determined that this wasn't a case of check washing.
605.60s - 609.84s |  According to the bank, checks that are authorized through the bank's app are sent
609.84s - 611.88s |  from a location in Evanston, Indiana.
612.52s - 615.12s |  If the check was originally addressed to the electric company,
615.12s - 616.64s |  it would have taken a different route.
616.64s - 621.36s |  It would have been en route from Evanston to the company's office in Chicago.
621.36s - 624.92s |  But the check was addressed to an individual in Rantoul in Cashton, Danville.
624.92s - 629.08s |  It would be unusual for a check originally from Evanston, Indiana, en route to Chicago,
629.08s - 633.88s |  Illinois, which is a northwest route, right, to be intercepted in Rantoul,
633.88s - 635.88s |  which is located further southwest.
635.88s - 640.64s |  It would require a diversion from the original route, and a detour would add a lot of time.
641.64s - 646.44s |  More importantly, though, and the biggest reason we knew that this wasn't the case,
647.40s - 652.20s |  was the check was intentionally and originally made out to an individual,
652.20s - 656.44s |  not the electric company, and this was apparent on the copy of the check that was included
656.44s - 658.20s |  in the business owner's account history.
659.08s - 662.28s |  Therefore, we concluded that we were looking at a case of just counterfeit.
665.58s - 669.38s |  The next step was so easy, it barely took any ocent at all on my end.
669.38s - 671.22s |  It was not a bright crime committed.
672.02s - 675.86s |  I knew that a counterfeit check was created and sent by an unknown bank employee,
675.86s - 681.06s |  not to the electric company, but to an individual determined to be located in Rantoul
681.06s - 686.34s |  because we had access to the check that was created, and this individual later signed it
686.34s - 689.06s |  over to someone else in Danville to be cashed.
689.58s - 693.98s |  These individuals used their full legal names and a copy of the check was saved
693.98s - 696.02s |  so we could see who they were.
696.98s - 701.54s |  All it took was a quick people search engine that led us straight to their personal information,
701.54s - 705.38s |  social media profiles under abbreviated names, and current addresses.
706.18s - 709.50s |  The individuals involved were even friends on social media,
709.50s - 712.86s |  so it kind of tied everything together with us.
713.38s - 717.94s |  The main suspect had a long criminal history with public court records dating as far back
718.46s - 724.54s |  as 1993 to as recent as 2022, revealing that the man is an armed habitual criminal.
724.90s - 730.94s |  His crimes included a history of domestic abuse, assault, burglary, theft, counterfeiting,
731.10s - 734.42s |  possession of meth, and previous counts of fraud.
734.90s - 738.78s |  He's even been featured in the local news more than once for forgery and fraud.
739.06s - 742.94s |  He just keeps getting let off easy, much to everyone's frustration by now.
743.30s - 750.87s |  The main criminal involved had a mutual friend with a business owner on social media.
751.55s - 755.35s |  And suspect number two who cashed the check was social media friends
755.35s - 757.43s |  with an employee at the business owner's bank.
757.95s - 760.67s |  So that's where weaving together connections comes in handy.
761.39s - 766.11s |  We think we know who's involved, but while the business owner is now aware
766.11s - 768.79s |  of the mutual friends and their connections to the suspects,
769.39s - 773.11s |  there's no telling who exactly was involved other than the two individuals
773.11s - 775.71s |  who physically handled the check and whose names we had.
776.43s - 779.55s |  Unless the bank decided to conduct an internal investigation,
779.83s - 784.87s |  we won't know what employee was involved in this process, or why or how,
785.27s - 787.83s |  or if there was a personal agenda behind the selection.
788.63s - 793.75s |  There may very well be some level of internal involvement that should be cause for concern
793.75s - 795.83s |  for all individuals who have an account with that bank.
796.99s - 803.63s |  But we haven't heard from the bank yet as to any sort of investigation internally.
804.67s - 807.83s |  The criminal might not be a mastermind for sure with all
807.83s - 811.15s |  of the information he left and all of those breadcrumbs.
811.59s - 815.95s |  But his actions caused financial harm to a really small business and left the victim worried
815.95s - 818.27s |  for their personal safety given his past record.
821.60s - 822.72s |  Why does it matter, right?
822.72s - 824.68s |  Businesses get scammed all the time.
825.04s - 826.92s |  Don't they have safety measures in place?
827.04s - 827.96s |  Many of them do.
828.48s - 831.60s |  But if we don't want a nation run by giant chain stores who have a monopoly
831.60s - 835.88s |  on affordable pricing, we need to do our best to help out when small businesses suffer.
835.88s - 839.92s |  And that's any small business, whether that's a shop, whether that's a tattoo parlor,
840.36s - 845.72s |  whether that's, you know, a little gas station set up on the corner, something, who knows.
846.28s - 850.04s |  Any sort of small business, we really want to be putting our money there and helping
850.04s - 852.44s |  out when these businesses get impacted.
852.56s - 857.44s |  So for some stats, right, we have 2023 statistics from the Federal Trade Commission
857.44s - 862.48s |  that reported that consumers themselves lost over $10 billion to fraud in 2023,
863.00s - 869.88s |  which was a significant increase from the $3.3 billion reported in 2020.
869.88s - 874.52s |  And this increase includes significant amounts lost to investment scams and imposter scams.
874.84s - 877.60s |  Small businesses are frequent targets of these scams due
877.60s - 880.12s |  to their perceived vulnerability and lower defenses.
880.16s - 883.24s |  Financial strain from fraud can lead to operational challenges
883.24s - 885.20s |  and in severe cases, business closure.
885.88s - 891.12s |  The Association for Financial Professionals Payments Fraud and Control Survey 2021 states
891.12s - 895.16s |  that 51% of businesses indicated that after a successful fraud attempt,
895.60s - 898.44s |  the organization was unable to recover funds lost.
898.44s - 900.12s |  They couldn't recover from the loss.
900.48s - 904.80s |  Almost two-thirds of businesses maybe recovered 25% or less,
904.80s - 906.96s |  but they were not able to recover from the loss.
906.96s - 909.88s |  So your favorite family-owned small restaurant on the corner,
909.88s - 913.04s |  if it gets targeted even once and experiences a significant loss,
913.04s - 914.76s |  it could decide to close for good.
914.76s - 916.64s |  And this does happen quite frequently.
917.40s - 921.44s |  Due to the fraudsters leaving obvious loaves of bread and not just breadcrumbs,
921.44s - 927.99s |  entire loaves, names, you know, they're full legal names,
927.99s - 931.31s |  we were able to quickly piece together relevant information
931.31s - 932.95s |  and locate them in a timely manner.
932.95s - 936.07s |  And we were also able to quickly track the number of frauds
936.07s - 939.67s |  and quickly piece together relevant information and locate them in a timely manner.
941.67s - 947.79s |  The main bad actor did end up being booked with the information included in the police report
947.79s - 949.51s |  that I was able to find and put together.
950.11s - 952.51s |  But we can only hope that they give him a longer sentence.
952.91s - 956.47s |  And hopefully, this prevents him from targeting another business,
956.47s - 958.11s |  even if it's just for a little while.
958.51s - 962.19s |  He's been brought in so many times, I don't know if they'll just let him back out there.
962.99s - 967.27s |  You know, small businesses in the area have to keep a lookout for this guy.
967.79s - 970.75s |  But for now, you know, they got him.
970.75s - 973.47s |  So I consider it a job well done.
977.89s - 983.69s |  And this next slide is just me listing some OSINT resources that I use on a regular basis.
983.69s - 986.65s |  And I used all of these resources when handling the request.
986.65s - 994.37s |  It's really just people search sites, public county record databases, social media sites,
994.69s - 999.41s |  some advanced search parameters and archive sites in case anything that we find
999.41s - 1003.77s |  on the individual was taken down and instead saved in an archive somewhere.
1005.33s - 1007.37s |  It didn't take a lot to catch these people.
1007.37s - 1011.37s |  It took some basic Googling to find out where they were located.
1012.49s - 1017.25s |  I hope that the information can help you to start your own list of OSINT resources
1017.25s - 1019.69s |  and maybe encourage you to help out in your community
1020.09s - 1022.69s |  and make a positive contribution in one way or another.
1023.09s - 1026.97s |  No matter how small you think the contribution is or how little you have to offer,
1027.37s - 1029.61s |  I promise you can do a lot with just a little.
1030.01s - 1032.33s |  And that little will mean everything to some people.
1034.25s - 1036.69s |  This business owner now feels a little bit more secure.
1036.69s - 1038.05s |  She now has a backup plan.
1038.85s - 1043.61s |  We've talked it over, just knowing that he's been booked brings some sort of comfort.
1044.13s - 1046.97s |  So thank you for coming to my talk.
1046.97s - 1048.97s |  And I hope it was an interesting little story.
1048.97s - 1054.57s |  It was really just meant to be an explanation of what the most basic level
1054.57s - 1057.17s |  of OSINT could do for you or do for your community.
1057.93s - 1062.17s |  You can find sources for this talk and a way to contact me on these slides.
1062.57s - 1065.69s |  It will be uploaded to my website, squiddle.io.
1065.77s - 1068.57s |  If you want to give me a follow, I'm on several social media sites.
1069.09s - 1071.13s |  And I've listed those accounts here.
1071.13s - 1076.33s |  So if anyone has any questions, I'm happy to answer them to the best of my ability now.
1080.18s - 1082.38s |  Will you speak for us again next year?
1083.58s - 1084.94s |  Yes, of course.
1085.22s - 1087.42s |  I'm really honored to be invited back this year.
1088.02s - 1088.38s |  Awesome.
1094.20s - 1094.92s |  Thank you, Scotty.
1095.32s - 1097.96s |  We appreciate your presentations every time.
1099.44s - 1099.88s |  Thank you.
1100.36s - 1109.36s |  I have a question.
1110.96s - 1117.16s |  When you're going on an investigation like this, aren't you worried you might stumble upon someone
1117.16s - 1121.48s |  who's a bit dangerous for you or what kind of precautions do you take?
1123.00s - 1126.84s |  Yeah, so that would be an example here, right?
1126.84s - 1131.88s |  Because this guy, he's an armed criminal and he's been put away.
1132.32s - 1133.44s |  Yeah, he has a record.
1133.72s - 1139.44s |  So the only precautions I really take are just not putting his name or face in this talk.
1139.52s - 1145.00s |  I would love to out him, but it wouldn't just be me that could be endangered by this.
1145.00s - 1146.40s |  It could be the business owner, right?
1146.84s - 1149.20s |  So I kind of just stay in the background.
1150.00s - 1151.76s |  We don't contact these people.
1152.44s - 1155.60s |  We don't let them know that we found out about them.
1155.60s - 1160.84s |  We just archive the information and send it where it needs to go so that there can be an investigation into it.
1161.36s - 1162.84s |  We kind of work in the background.
1164.48s - 1165.32s |  OK, thanks.
1166.44s - 1167.00s |  No problem.
1167.56s - 1169.92s |  So as a like a consultant, correct?
1172.90s - 1173.66s |  Yeah, kind of.
1173.66s - 1175.38s |  Yeah, just an investigator.
1180.09s - 1182.45s |  I'm not contacting these individuals myself.
