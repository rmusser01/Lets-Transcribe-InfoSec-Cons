 Hello! Hello! I can't see anybody from these lights, but I'm sensing you're out there.
8.96s - 13.92s |  I'm sensing the mood, the vibes are good. Well, welcome everybody to our panel. My name is Rachel,
13.92s - 20.00s |  I'm the organizer of IoT Village, and we put together a little panel on threat landscapes,
20.00s - 26.16s |  AI, chat, GPT, all that jazz. So I'm going to let the panelists introduce themselves real quick,
26.16s - 34.51s |  and then we'll jump into the questions. Go for it. All right. Hello, I'm Steve McGregory,
34.51s - 42.67s |  I'm the director of cybersecurity R&D at Keysight. We build products that help people test
42.67s - 49.31s |  their network security, their devices, make assessments of their devices. I've been doing
49.31s - 57.87s |  security and R&D for since about 91. I spent the 90s running internet service provider
57.87s - 64.75s |  businesses, got hacked, and decided in 2000 to really spend my time doing cybersecurity. I
64.75s - 70.19s |  built an intrusion prevention system at a tipping point, and then moved into testing.
70.67s - 79.95s |  I've been doing that since, so nice to meet you. So Jamie Hardy. So I product manage now
80.67s - 85.95s |  adversary management at Intuit. I've been from fintech to semiconductor,
88.11s - 94.51s |  back to fintech, all over the board. And yeah, I'm super excited to be here.
95.23s - 101.95s |  I actually broke out of engineering to product management when I took over IoT security at
101.95s - 107.55s |  Qualcomm. So that's a blast. And I have a lot of insights from back in the day,
107.55s - 114.43s |  like about five years ago from IoT, and expanding that with cloud security. So super fun space.
114.67s - 119.63s |  Super fun space. Your mic's dead. You want to maybe try Steve's?
122.11s - 128.91s |  You got it. Can you hear me now? Oh, shit. Sorry. Part of my French.
130.91s - 142.99s |  No. Hello. Hello. Hello. Oh, we're good now. Yes. Cool. So again, Jamie Hardy. Cool.
142.99s - 150.59s |  Product manager, Intuit. Where are we at? So been fintech, semiconductor, government,
150.59s - 157.79s |  back to fintech. Branched out of engineering when I took over IoT security for Qualcomm.
158.51s - 162.99s |  Loving everything at Intuit now. Got lots of stories to tell, lots of fun times to have,
162.99s - 169.79s |  and super pumped to be here with these guys. And super excited to partner with IoT Village,
169.79s - 175.31s |  because I love what you guys are doing about, like, bridging the gap with people who need to,
175.31s - 181.23s |  like, outside in their daily day to day, being able to apply stuff. Love it.
185.82s - 190.94s |  Hi, I'm Ted Harrington. I'm one of the partners at Independent Security
190.94s - 199.18s |  Evaluators, and we founded and run IoT Village. I wrote a book called Hackable,
199.18s - 203.50s |  how to do application security right, kind of talks about the things that we see from
203.50s - 206.46s |  the front lines of ethical hacking. I think the ideas would resonate with a lot of people in this
206.46s - 211.58s |  room. And I'm just here to learn from these guys and to make sure that Rachel looks good
211.58s - 215.98s |  while protecting her eyes. Those are my sunglasses. I buy your book.
218.30s - 224.30s |  First question. How should IoT companies be thinking about the intersection of AI,
224.30s - 227.42s |  security, and IoT? Steve, you want to start that one?
228.06s - 238.22s |  Is this working? Yeah. All right. Well, I think IoT security, IoT vendors, or people using IoT
238.22s - 245.42s |  devices have to probably be very concerned that if you go back and look at something like Mirai,
245.42s - 253.34s |  the botnet that took over all the IoT devices, they're kind of weak. So I think using tools
253.34s - 261.90s |  like AI, you can probably, the adversaries can very easily put together automated attack tools
261.90s - 269.18s |  and go after it and make Mirai look minuscule, potentially, right? So I think we've got to
269.18s - 276.86s |  take it and build security into the product, starting with our efforts to build IoT devices,
276.86s - 282.46s |  make them more secure. Otherwise, we're just leaving ourselves even more vulnerable in the
282.54s - 287.34s |  face of AI. Jamie?
288.78s - 295.02s |  So, okay. So many things I want to say. I guess coming back to the world of IoT,
295.02s - 299.26s |  the number one thing I want to say is it's all ingrained in the hardware root of trust,
299.26s - 306.22s |  right? And I want to keep coming back to that. But if I think about gen AI, AI, ML, all this,
306.22s - 312.14s |  you know, blah, blah, blah, blah that everyone talks about, like, yeah, we are using it to be
312.14s - 318.38s |  smarter. I mean, hell, I use chat GPT every day to write whatever language I need. I mean,
318.38s - 324.94s |  everybody does. And everybody uses that to write code every single day, right? And the adversaries
324.94s - 332.62s |  are using it against us, just like we're using it to defense against them. And it's whether it's IoT,
332.62s - 338.78s |  cloud security, it doesn't matter. It's the same game. And it's, it's quite frankly, scary,
338.78s - 346.14s |  because it's creating them to be faster. And they're creating malicious businesses off,
346.14s - 355.18s |  you know, literally, I mean, quite frankly, there's, sorry. My bad. There are adversaries
355.18s - 362.22s |  out there literally, you know, running their books in QuickBooks. Right? I mean, it's a scary
362.22s - 371.50s |  thing. So I agree. Yeah. What I think is interesting about what you're talking about is
371.50s - 378.46s |  how, like every emerging tech, I think this is true, that there's some new tech comes around.
378.46s - 382.06s |  And we're like, everything's different now. And it's like, well, no, not really like the
382.06s - 386.22s |  fundamental principles of how we secure systems, how systems get exploited, those are the same,
386.22s - 391.58s |  then the implementation of the tech is different. And what you were talking about with, you know,
391.58s - 397.66s |  makes the adversary faster, makes but it also makes us faster to one thing I think that is
397.66s - 414.75s |  different about just went dead. We did. Hello, going great. Wasn't me. Hello. Okay, well,
415.55s - 420.51s |  oh, we can still hear us if we're talking without microphones. I can't see a damn person. But if
420.51s - 432.43s |  you can hear us, we're having to chat. We should be bringing a megaphone. Yeah, seriously. Bring
432.43s - 439.55s |  it in closer. You want some real stories that we shouldn't talk about? Let's talk about that.
439.55s - 445.63s |  Bring that shit closer under NDA. Under the verbal NDA. You all agree. Cool. We're there.
445.71s - 450.51s |  They're all dead. Yeah, every single one's all dead. Yeah, this shit's dead.
450.51s - 458.35s |  Heard it click. Yeah, it died. Someone did not like. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're here.
458.35s - 466.67s |  They were like, that's it. Well, on that note, great panel. Yeah. Good first question.
467.31s - 473.84s |  We almost got through one. Almost got through one question. Somebody take a picture.
478.48s - 482.64s |  Cool. We can do it. I'll always take a picture. Yeah. I mean, I would take a picture of them,
482.64s - 487.84s |  but again, I can't see them. There's people out there. I swear there are people out there
489.92s - 493.84s |  by them. I mean, you all, I can see like the first two or three rows.
493.84s - 500.88s |  Maybe I see you and you, you walk around and do it. Yeah. And you just go out into the hallway
501.68s - 509.04s |  and like, yeah, fuck it. Let's do that. Yeah. All right, guys, we're going to come to you.
510.24s - 511.28s |  Get off the stage and come to you.
519.86s - 526.02s |  Totally not. Oh, it is on. Well, first of all, thank you guys for
526.66s - 530.26s |  just going with the flow on that. That was very hackerish of everyone. Just, just adapt.
530.34s - 534.82s |  Sorry, go ahead. I was letting you roll with it also. This is my nap time. Here we go.
535.94s - 540.34s |  Relaxing now. Another question going. Yeah. That was another question for us. That was cool.
541.94s - 546.90s |  Someone can use a non-foresting pipe to ask a question.
549.30s - 554.34s |  If you got a question, come on up. And it's gone again. It's gone again. Is it going again?
554.34s - 558.58s |  Hello? Nope. This works. All right, Jamie's in charge now.
558.66s - 562.98s |  All right, I'm in charge. Who's got a question?
567.86s - 575.54s |  There was an attack surface question. Can we go that direction? Actually, I didn't catch your name,
575.54s - 582.10s |  but do you want to come up here and maybe expand on that? He's like, no, he's like, no,
582.58s - 589.62s |  you're on. Maybe perhaps friend. No. All right. Does anyone have any questions they want to ask?
590.34s - 597.70s |  I got like three minutes left. I mean, the whole thing is about how adversaries expand on
597.70s - 605.22s |  attack surface management, right? So we are using AI and all these tools to expand on how we
605.94s - 611.06s |  expand discovery. Right. And I can tell you, and I just feels like a super hot mic.
612.10s - 617.30s |  Like port scanning, discovery and all these things. Right. We can get more predictive in
617.30s - 624.50s |  terms of where adversaries are going. Right. Every port we discover, we can tell like 10 more.
625.14s - 635.22s |  Right. But how do we provide the best practices for the mid-sized small businesses that,
635.22s - 641.46s |  you know, here's the thing. You got big enterprise companies like us and we got teams of people who
641.46s - 646.58s |  know what they're doing. But then you got Joe Schmo, who's got no dedicated engineers,
646.58s - 652.34s |  no dedicated tools, and nobody probably in this audience whatsoever, and they should be hiring.
652.98s - 658.26s |  And so how do you help them? Yeah. That's my question back to you guys. I love that.
659.06s - 665.70s |  How do you help the small company? How do you help the company that's got 20 to 100 employees
665.70s - 671.38s |  and no dedicated security tooling and no dedicated security people? You and me and
671.38s - 679.46s |  you all know how we do this. How do you solve that problem? All I'll say, I will say is that
679.46s - 688.02s |  10 years ago, I was given a, I was speaking at AT&T and I did a stat and it, the recommendation
688.02s - 696.66s |  was one security researcher or person engineer per a hundred employees or something like that.
696.66s - 702.18s |  And realistically, it was nowhere ever close to that. You know, you'd have a hundred or 200
702.18s - 707.06s |  employee and you have an IT guy that also does security, right? One guy for that company. And
707.06s - 711.14s |  you have a thousand employees. You may have two of those guys or something like that, right? That
711.14s - 716.02s |  was the stats that were coming up. So that's where, where I'm going with this though, is in my
716.02s - 724.26s |  hope is that AI, ML and AI are meant to process large amounts of data and do things autonomously,
724.26s - 731.38s |  which should help that case, right? If you can, if you can budget tools that can help
731.38s - 736.10s |  accelerate the one or two people, right? Theoretically, this is, this is a good thing.
736.98s - 743.54s |  And whether or not it's actually being achieved right now, I mean, I can't answer, but that's,
743.54s - 750.34s |  I mean, my, in short is that I'm hoping AI is probably, it should be an answer for this
750.34s - 754.74s |  problem that we deal with, with low, you know. Yeah. I love that. Like when you think about
754.74s - 759.78s |  security questionnaires, right? Who here has to deal with those, right? Those are fun. Whether
759.78s - 764.58s |  you're issuing them and then having to like comb through all the results and say, is this a red
764.58s - 768.26s |  flag or not? Or you're having to respond to tons of them, to all the companies you want to do
768.26s - 774.02s |  business with. I think that's a great example of where AI and ML is going to significantly reduce
774.02s - 777.62s |  person power, because it's going to be able to say like, okay, we understand the types of
777.62s - 783.14s |  questions. Here's our prepared answers. It can, it's going to be, that is a bright future. And
783.14s - 792.90s |  it's not that far away. I think we're, I mean, all the mics, Jesus. I mean, why can't we build
792.90s - 798.58s |  that into an AI chatbot? Jamie, we're at time. Oh, we are. All right. I know. What a bummer.
798.58s - 802.58s |  Ask some questions. Super smart responses. Thank you all. There you go.
803.22s - 806.18s |  Thanks everybody. Sorry, this was so chaotic.
806.18s - 811.38s |  We'll hang out after, outside for anyone who wants to ask questions one-on-one. Thank you.
