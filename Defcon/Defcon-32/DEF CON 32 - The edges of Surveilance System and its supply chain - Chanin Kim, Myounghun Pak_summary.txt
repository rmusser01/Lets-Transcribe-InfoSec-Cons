**Surveillance System Challenges and Motivation**
- Development of **artificial intelligence** and **image processing technology** impacts video industry like CCTV.
- **Security issues**: CCTV infringes on privacy, personal information leaks due to hacking or illegal video collection.
- Lack of awareness and research on **NVR (Network Video Recorder)**, crucial in surveillance systems.
- Target vendors: **Hikvision**, **Dahua**, and **Synology's Surveillance Station**.
- Successful **bypass of U-Boot mitigation**; discovered vulnerabilities and conducted OEM verification.

**Research Methodology**
- **Firmware Extraction**: Utilized **UART ports** and **SSH access**; challenges with remote access bypass attempts.
- **U-Boot Mitigation**: Techniques for bypassing using older device versions.
- **Kernel Share Access**: Techniques for obtaining kernel shares using **U-Boot commands**.

**Vulnerability Analysis**
- **Vendor A**: Explored query string parsing leading to **buffer overflow**.
- **Synology**: Discovered missing authorization allowing **guest abuse** of surveillance features.
- **Dahua**: Found **reachable assertion** and **LP injection** vulnerabilities; tampered groupsec file leads to admin takeover.
- **Hikvision**: Analyzed local subs component; discovered **RCE** vulnerability.

**Impact on Surveillance Systems**
- **Supply Chain Security**: Vulnerabilities in OEM products affect devices sold under different brands.
- **Device Vulnerability**: Approximately 130,000 devices (Hikvision) and 100,000 devices (Dahua) found vulnerable.
- Recommendation for **MBR users**: Avoid exposing MBR to external networks to prevent attacks.

**Recommendations for Researchers and Users**
- **Researchers**: Focus on various attack surfaces, not just HTTP communication.
- **Users**: Utilize solutions that allow external access without exposing devices to external networks.

**Conclusion and Acknowledgments**
- Research highlighted numerous vulnerabilities; emphasis on diverse attack surfaces for comprehensive analysis.
