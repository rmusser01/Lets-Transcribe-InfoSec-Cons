**Introduction to Physical Access Control Systems**

- Physical access control systems can be exploited in various ways
- Weaknesses include the **credential**, **communication protocol**, **hardware**, or **firmware**
- Exploits often involve a combination of factors
- **Mutual authentication** verification is crucial for security

**Types of Attacks on Access Control Systems**

- **Cloning**: Making a copy of a credential; trivial due to known keys
- **Downgrade Attacks**: Moving secure credentials to insecure ones
- **Emulation**: Using tools like **Proxmark 3** or **Flipper 0** to mimic credentials
- **Firmware Exploits**: Targeting bugs in reader firmware for unauthorized access

**Technical Overview of HID Credentials**

- **HID I-class SE Readers**: Enforce secure credentials
- **Legacy Credentials**: Use a standard authentication key; keys leaked in "Heart of Darkness" paper
- **Transitional Credentials (SR)**: Allow emulation with correct serial number
- **SE Credentials**: More secure; keys not easily recoverable

**Access Control System Components**

- **Reader and Controller Communication**: Uses **Wiegand protocol**
- **Reader Functionality**: Reads credentials and relays data to the controller
- **Credential Properties**: Includes bit length and checksum for integrity verification

**Security of Different HID Credentials**

- **I-Class Legacy**: Cryptography broken, easy to clone
- **I-Class SR**: Transitional, allows for downgrading and emulation
- **I-Class SE**: More secure, keys not leaked, can be downgraded or emulated in certain conditions

**Mitigating Exploits in Access Control Systems**

- Use of high-security key sets, updating firmware, and disabling legacy technologies
- Issuing secure credentials such as **SEOS**, **DESFIRE**, or mobile credentials

**Common Flaws in Credential Installations**

- Use of the same facility code across installations
- Enabled legacy technologies make systems vulnerable
- Publicly available documentation can expose vulnerabilities
