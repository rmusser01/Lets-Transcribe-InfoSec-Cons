4.72s - 6.80s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Giglia is our next speaker.
6.80s - 9.82s |  He's one of the staff here at DEFCON Groups VR.
10.56s - 15.68s |  And he's a ham radio enthusiast and hacker from San Diego.
15.68s - 18.48s |  He's part of DEFCON 858.
19.46s - 24.88s |  Giglia is presenting Something Something Meshtastic Pip-Boy Personal Mesh
24.88s - 26.68s |  with 150 Kilometer Reach.
27.10s - 32.76s |  Now, I know that sounds a little abstract, and it kind of is, because meshtastic,
32.76s - 36.60s |  if anybody's noticed, has exploded in popularity.
37.06s - 41.34s |  And there's quite a bit of controversy now, given that there's a new FCC ruling.
41.34s - 44.38s |  I hope you're good, or they're talking about a new FCC ruling.
44.82s - 46.22s |  I hope you talk about that.
46.70s - 51.98s |  Meshtastic, a wireless-based mesh network for off-grid communications.
52.34s - 56.78s |  Think party in the woods with no cellular, but cellular can still,
57.08s - 61.30s |  but with no cellular, but can still text and make fun of your friend's outfit.
61.76s - 65.48s |  And that's one of the cool things, is this gives you essentially a personal,
66.56s - 71.44s |  like, cell phone text SMS capability, completely offline,
71.44s - 77.40s |  without need for massive infrastructure, at very low cost.
78.00s - 85.14s |  And for his bio, Giglia has given us a, what's he say, an LLM-generated limerick.
85.76s - 91.08s |  There once was a lad, brave and free, whose words I shall craft in glee
91.32s - 97.84s |  Meshtastic, he said, with his Pip-Boy each day, he traveled so far with amazing spree.
98.20s - 100.48s |  So with that, Giglio, take it away.
102.04s - 102.76s |  Hey, everybody.
103.80s - 108.48s |  Like X-Ray said, I'm Giglio, part of the DEF CON Groups VR team.
110.32s - 114.36s |  And it's a really good team, so I'm glad to be part of it.
114.70s - 121.98s |  Um, so I, the, my talk title is a little odd.
122.38s - 127.22s |  Um, I was trying to come up with something, I mean, Meshtastic is a thing
127.22s - 131.66s |  that's, I've got a lot of knobs and things to twiddle and can be a
131.66s - 135.02s |  little technically, uh, boring, I guess.
135.30s - 140.22s |  So, uh, the something, something, uh, I've got a couple other things to talk
140.22s - 144.30s |  about and at a high level, kind of where I want to come at this from.
144.86s - 153.58s |  Um, the theme of DEF CON 32 itself is we engage, and that is an outgrowth of a
153.58s - 157.38s |  talk and some, or many of you may have seen it last year, I didn't get to see
157.38s - 165.46s |  it, but I have read the notes from the blog, um, Cory Doctorow did a talk on
165.54s - 170.74s |  the insidification of the internet and how the internet used to be a thing
170.76s - 172.52s |  where people shared ideas and things.
173.00s - 179.04s |  And it, it turns into this place where it is being mined for various things.
179.36s - 185.40s |  And then at some point, whatever benefit there was is gone and it goes the other
185.40s - 187.52s |  way and it becomes a bad thing.
187.84s - 193.48s |  And so Cory has a plan to roll that back and try to fix it.
193.54s - 199.84s |  So that's kind of the, the high level of where DEF CON, uh, dark tangent
199.98s - 203.90s |  and those folks came up with the, we engage.
204.22s - 209.06s |  And so I'm going to kind of come out in a shtastic from a couple of different
209.06s - 216.54s |  angles, um, but ultimately it's going to be in the anti-insidification angle.
217.02s - 221.42s |  And also the, what happens if bad things happen?
221.42s - 225.42s |  Like say all of a sudden we have some sort of issue, your cell phones
225.42s - 227.18s |  don't work anymore, that kind of stuff.
227.60s - 230.72s |  So you can, you can use mesh tastic a lot of different ways.
231.80s - 238.56s |  Um, so I've been thinking about different things related to the internet and it
238.56s - 243.16s |  wasn't so much, I guess it would be in parallel with Cory's talk, but I've been
243.16s - 248.60s |  starting to accumulate my own locally stored content because it's becoming more
248.60s - 252.92s |  and more obvious that Google as a search engine is not a search engine.
253.32s - 257.12s |  It's a way to push stuff in your face to try to get you to look at it.
257.56s - 261.76s |  And every website that you go to, if you're not running a pie hole or some
261.76s - 266.18s |  kind of content filtering or something that scrubs all the junk off the page,
266.56s - 271.48s |  it's almost like if you went back to the old, um, I can't think of what the,
271.88s - 275.40s |  what the arrow was on the internet, but where everybody designed their own
275.40s - 280.32s |  webpages, but they were all on acid and, you know, and they were trying to sell
280.32s - 283.96s |  you, uh, skunks that can breathe fire or something.
284.28s - 286.08s |  So you see all these kinds of ads all day.
286.46s - 295.26s |  Um, on the mish tastic topic, we're going to, I'm going to, I've got my notes I'm
295.26s - 299.30s |  referring to, and I realized that my notes are now out of alignment with my slide deck.
299.30s - 300.90s |  I've been poking at all day.
301.30s - 302.82s |  So I'm going to come back to some of this.
303.10s - 310.46s |  Um, so for the, now I have to turn myself around again, so I can see my slide deck.
311.66s - 313.70s |  Do do do do.
313.70s - 314.00s |  Okay.
314.00s - 317.12s |  So we are going to scroll this guy up a click.
319.89s - 320.29s |  Okay.
320.69s - 331.78s |  So the, the something, something for my first something, this is going to be how
331.78s - 341.86s |  you can do things that are either free or you can, uh, access free content and so on.
342.18s - 347.10s |  So I know we have a worldwide audience in the United States.
347.26s - 351.18s |  It's still the case that you can go get a library card for the local library,
351.18s - 356.08s |  which I recommend everybody do because it supports the library system.
356.08s - 360.80s |  And it lets them know that we still care about what's going on in the world.
361.24s - 366.84s |  Um, soon as you do that, go get on either the iOS store or the Android
366.84s - 369.24s |  store, and there's an app called Libby.
369.76s - 374.88s |  And what it is is an electronic version, if you will, of your local library.
375.52s - 379.84s |  And you can sign up for magazine subscriptions.
380.34s - 384.58s |  You know, current magazines, books, they have all kinds of content out there.
384.58s - 385.18s |  It's free.
385.18s - 386.82s |  It's part of the library system.
387.26s - 393.10s |  They just have you link up underneath a, uh, whatever your current library
393.10s - 398.14s |  network is, um, like, uh, that's where he said I'm in San Diego.
398.14s - 400.42s |  So mine's part of the San Diego library system.
401.14s - 406.22s |  And then once you do that, so also go look for canopy starts with a K.
407.16s - 412.40s |  That is an online streaming service that has all kinds of different movies.
412.76s - 416.32s |  And it basically runs on a kind of a credit system.
416.32s - 420.20s |  They give you, I forget how many credits per month, and then you go rent a movie
420.20s - 422.16s |  and you get, I think, a couple of days to watch it.
422.20s - 423.84s |  It uses a credit or two.
424.28s - 426.72s |  And then, so it's basically free to you.
427.08s - 428.36s |  So that's another benefit.
428.88s - 435.68s |  Um, the other thing I did a talk last year on why hackers should get a ham
435.98s - 439.98s |  radio license and it was called, uh, was it ham radio?
439.98s - 441.38s |  Isn't just for dinosaurs.
441.74s - 444.06s |  And so I'm going to jump to my next slide.
444.06s - 446.90s |  Assuming I have not messed up my order here.
452.60s - 454.84s |  If we can get it to stay put, that'd be awesome.
454.84s - 455.84s |  We'll just stay there, I guess.
456.36s - 465.00s |  Uh, so, so what getting a ham radio license does for a hacker, which I know
465.00s - 469.62s |  a lot of people think of ham radio guys is, you know, old farts sit and talk
469.64s - 473.32s |  about, uh, what kind of shoes did we get today and into the wee hours of the
473.32s - 478.48s |  night, well, technology being a thing and we're all hackers, so what that
478.48s - 484.28s |  actually does is that gives you the, uh, unlocks the achievement to where you
484.28s - 489.24s |  can do pretty much anything that's RF and frequency based, as long as you
489.24s - 494.04s |  stay in the bands that your license lets you use, um, you start out with a
494.04s - 498.44s |  technician license that lets you get all the bands you see on the screen here.
498.66s - 506.34s |  So that satellite communication, uh, two meters, 70 centimeter on up ham radio.
509.31s - 513.75s |  And, uh, a little interjection there from, uh, somebody.
514.15s - 518.71s |  Um, then if you do general class, you can also do HF.
519.27s - 526.19s |  Anyway, this lets you now experiment and do things with, uh, RF
526.19s - 528.63s |  frequencies and you're licensed.
528.75s - 533.05s |  So that is actually a big deal because when we talk about mesh tastic, that's
533.05s - 540.01s |  low power and, but there is, uh, the 915 megahertz range, which is where mesh
540.01s - 543.97s |  tastic lives, that's also the 33 centimeter ham radio band.
544.41s - 548.73s |  So there's overlap there and you can do things, uh, having that ability.
550.11s - 555.05s |  So that's my, so as far as my title, something, something mesh tastic.
555.41s - 557.37s |  This is our first something.
557.71s - 566.82s |  The second, something is going to be, so back to Corey's, uh, in
566.82s - 570.90s |  certification of the internet and my comments about, you know,
570.94s - 574.34s |  maintaining local, uh, cached things.
575.62s - 578.90s |  There are the things that you can do with that.
578.90s - 585.16s |  And, and for me, I did it with a humble bundle, humble bundle book bundle,
585.46s - 588.22s |  and I've been buying those and collecting them over the years.
588.88s - 590.00s |  And I realized, you know what?
590.00s - 593.12s |  I could put all this stuff in a bucket and I could index the bucket
593.68s - 595.30s |  and then add other stuff to it.
595.32s - 600.52s |  Like if you go out and look on Google, you can find free, uh, it's
600.52s - 602.64s |  the Oxford English dictionary.
603.08s - 606.40s |  Now it's spread over various years of things because Google
606.40s - 608.32s |  scanned things that were available.
608.92s - 611.92s |  You can download that stuff, stick it in your bucket, index it.
612.90s - 617.86s |  I found an indexing tool called cyst two, which is pretty slick.
618.18s - 622.46s |  So this lets you then put every thing that you care about in your own
622.46s - 625.62s |  bucket, you can index it, and now that's your internet.
626.26s - 631.54s |  The other thing you can do is, and x-ray turned me onto this real recently.
631.54s - 632.74s |  I didn't, I wasn't aware of it.
633.06s - 638.14s |  Internet in a box and what it is, it can run on a Raspberry Pi.
638.14s - 639.90s |  You can run it on different things.
640.40s - 646.52s |  I'm running it on one of those little old, uh, it's a Lenovo in 93 P it's
646.52s - 649.92s |  the one that's like a double-decker peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
649.92s - 651.80s |  You know, it's like a probably Mac mini size.
652.44s - 653.92s |  And let me see if I can do this right.
654.60s - 660.68s |  If we go back over here and then I go over here now, let me get back
660.68s - 661.68s |  here and make sure we're seeing that.
661.68s - 662.04s |  Yeah.
662.28s - 668.16s |  So this is my local copy of the internet in a box.
668.40s - 669.48s |  So I installed it.
669.50s - 673.70s |  Uh, I'm running it on Ubuntu and it downloaded.
673.86s - 678.02s |  I went for the prebuilt 256 gig bundle, if you will.
678.42s - 682.82s |  So I've got Wikipedia, 102 gigs of Wikipedia.
683.38s - 687.06s |  And, uh, let's see how fast it's going to behave or is it going
687.06s - 688.54s |  to blow up while I'm doing a demo?
688.70s - 689.26s |  Yeah, there we go.
689.70s - 695.85s |  See if we have anything with DEF CON, DEF CON robot context.
695.93s - 699.05s |  Anyway, there's, uh, those are defense contracts.
699.13s - 700.69s |  Let's see the security conference.
700.71s - 701.11s |  Here we go.
701.71s - 702.03s |  Okay.
702.03s - 703.69s |  So here's the DEF CON security conference.
703.69s - 705.59s |  Now this is all locally cached content.
705.59s - 708.67s |  It's living under my feet in my little computer table.
709.15s - 714.59s |  So, uh, you could basically make your own internet here.
714.95s - 717.19s |  Project Gutenberg library in English.
717.55s - 719.83s |  It has all kinds of awesome stuff.
720.03s - 724.03s |  You know, pick, pick whatever things aren't under license anymore.
724.03s - 727.71s |  And they're probably in here to the tune of 71 gig.
728.09s - 732.89s |  It also has training, uh, you know, ostensibly what the internet is boxes
732.89s - 738.49s |  for is for places that might not have access to technology or they're so far
738.49s - 744.37s |  out there that, you know, pre somebody being able to have a satellite link up
744.37s - 749.01s |  to the internet that you can build this internet in a box and it's real
749.01s - 753.53s |  straightforward and then you can also duplicate it, uh, it's got a thing down
753.55s - 759.55s |  here for, uh, insert a USB stick drive to publish files and you can also share
759.55s - 764.67s |  things because the whole, the whole concept is this should be free content.
765.03s - 765.31s |  Right?
765.31s - 767.75s |  So you're not stealing somebody's licensed content.
767.75s - 768.83s |  You're using what's out there.
768.83s - 774.15s |  That's already free before it disappears because you know, uh, I figured who it
774.15s - 780.11s |  was, a lot of those link shortener sites on the web, well, I figured who it was.
780.11s - 780.91s |  It might've been Google.
780.99s - 781.95s |  They just turned it off.
782.31s - 782.47s |  Yeah.
782.47s - 782.81s |  You know what?
782.81s - 784.41s |  These are going to expire in a couple of days.
784.73s - 786.05s |  Uh, have a nice life.
786.41s - 793.25s |  So, you know, we kind of have to engage to follow the theme and follow what we
793.25s - 795.21s |  think we're going to need going forward.
795.65s - 799.25s |  So now we're going to jump back to my talk, which is over there.
799.33s - 799.73s |  Okay.
800.73s - 802.53s |  So that's the second something.
802.93s - 807.45s |  Um, so now what we can do, oh yeah, uh, local LLM.
807.79s - 813.93s |  So the, the limerick and, uh, if you see, can I turn around here so I can see
813.93s - 820.55s |  everybody, uh, if you know me or hang out with me, you'll realize I'm rarely
820.59s - 823.87s |  serious or if I am serious, I'm serious.
823.87s - 825.27s |  And then I go back to being silly.
825.71s - 832.35s |  Um, but so what I did was I asked this, uh, I have an app that runs on the iPhone.
832.95s - 834.19s |  It needs to be an iPhone.
834.19s - 839.01s |  It's got the latest processors also works on the Mac with the Apple
839.01s - 845.23s |  Silicon and the iPad, the one to get would be the latest iPad with the M4.
845.57s - 846.89s |  But anyway, it's all local.
847.21s - 852.29s |  And so there's a thing called local LLM, make sure you use names, right.
852.57s - 854.61s |  And another one called offline chat.
855.03s - 859.65s |  And what you do is, uh, I think each one of them is maybe 10 bucks.
860.61s - 863.57s |  The cool thing is local LLM is very well supported.
864.29s - 871.05s |  And so there's a bunch of different models that they, uh, they pick models
871.05s - 872.71s |  and there's a term for what they do.
872.77s - 876.17s |  And of course it's escaping me now that I'm in the middle of a presentation.
876.61s - 882.17s |  Um, but they basically grind them to where they can fit on a device.
882.43s - 886.53s |  And as long as the device has a high enough, uh, neural processor
886.69s - 888.81s |  ability, you can talk to the thing.
889.21s - 893.77s |  But the nice thing is like the internet in a box, it's totally local to you.
894.07s - 896.15s |  Nobody is looking at what you're asking.
896.39s - 899.39s |  Nobody is, you know, trying to drive an ad to you.
899.41s - 902.67s |  Hey, you looked up some, I've got this ugly thing on my foot.
902.67s - 905.47s |  And all of a sudden something's trying to sell you band-aids or something.
905.91s - 909.83s |  Uh, none of that you can, you know, basically you have some privacy when
909.83s - 910.91s |  you want to go look up something.
911.43s - 912.91s |  So I've been playing with those.
912.91s - 915.37s |  So I asked the thing to make a limerick and I told it, you need
915.37s - 917.19s |  to use mesh tastic distance.
917.19s - 919.71s |  And if you get some other word, so that's what it came up with.
920.01s - 922.77s |  Um, um, Defcon specific.
923.13s - 927.05s |  So the Defcon data duplication village, that's been in existence,
927.05s - 928.89s |  I think for a decade at least.
929.55s - 933.13s |  And what they do is they have put together, I think they're at six
933.13s - 939.69s |  terabytes now of content of things that, you know, basically the
939.69s - 941.53s |  diet every hacker could use.
942.01s - 945.87s |  And then what people do is you have to check ahead of time and set up a
946.73s - 950.85s |  because as everyone knows, it takes a little while to duplicate six terabytes,
951.09s - 955.17s |  but you buy the drive and you know, whatever they recommend in terms of
955.17s - 958.49s |  the technology, this has been around pre SSD.
958.77s - 963.29s |  So it used to be, they'd tell you, get this particular drive because
963.29s - 966.45s |  it'll spin this fast, the frame sizes are just right and all that.
966.85s - 971.17s |  Um, but anyway, they'll duplicate it for free and you take it home and
971.17s - 975.43s |  now you've got six terabytes of, you know, cool, awesome, uh, Defcon
975.43s - 977.19s |  data, uh, hacker type data.
977.87s - 978.79s |  Um, okay.
978.79s - 981.31s |  So that that's our second something.
981.37s - 981.99s |  Yes.
982.03s - 982.33s |  Okay.
982.33s - 983.11s |  Now I forget.
983.35s - 987.23s |  I've been playing with these slides all day, uh, as the event was going on.
987.23s - 990.79s |  So I have myself forgotten what comes next.
990.79s - 991.21s |  Let's see.
991.23s - 992.63s |  We did internet in a box.
993.61s - 994.77s |  D D D D.
994.77s - 995.81s |  We did CIS two.
995.81s - 997.93s |  So this is CIS two, the indexer.
998.17s - 1002.89s |  So you can see this one here has, I put the word hacker in and I've
1002.89s - 1007.97s |  indexed data that apparently has date stamps going back to 79, all the way
1007.97s - 1013.17s |  up to, you can see when last time I did it was, uh, the latter part of June.
1013.61s - 1016.81s |  It'll index applications, audio images, text video.
1017.11s - 1019.49s |  So I put the word hacker in and spit out some stuff.
1019.49s - 1020.73s |  So I screen snip that.
1021.11s - 1024.35s |  So this is, this is pretty useful.
1024.35s - 1026.01s |  And again, it's all local to you.
1026.07s - 1027.59s |  Nobody's watching what you're doing.
1028.15s - 1030.57s |  So, yeah, so here we go.
1030.57s - 1032.19s |  So now we're going to head into MeshTastic.
1032.43s - 1036.67s |  So, uh, and if anybody's a Monty Python fan and now for
1036.67s - 1038.31s |  something completely MeshTastic.
1038.91s - 1043.63s |  So we're going to talk about the components that make up MeshTastic
1043.63s - 1044.87s |  and I'm going to take a sip of tea.
1048.42s - 1052.82s |  When I was thinking about doing this talk, I was going, MeshTastic
1052.84s - 1053.92s |  has a lot of components.
1053.92s - 1058.46s |  Let's say there's like a dozen different things that you would
1058.46s - 1063.88s |  want to understand if you're going to get into MeshTastic like a person
1063.88s - 1067.76s |  would, if they wanted to race cars and build their own engines
1067.76s - 1068.76s |  and do that kind of stuff.
1069.16s - 1070.10s |  You don't have to do that.
1070.10s - 1071.24s |  You can just drive the car.
1071.64s - 1074.86s |  Um, but I found, and this is a different DEF CON village.
1074.86s - 1080.16s |  It's called the Lonely Hackers Club and they have a MeshTastic
1080.28s - 1086.10s |  website with directions for how to do MeshTastic, get set up, and
1086.10s - 1087.98s |  they're specific to DEF CON as well.
1088.52s - 1089.78s |  And I thought it was so awesome.
1089.78s - 1091.82s |  I'm like, why would I build my own thing?
1092.10s - 1095.70s |  So I reached out to him and I said, Hey, can I use your thing in my
1095.70s - 1096.38s |  presentation?
1096.38s - 1097.62s |  Like, heck yeah, go for it.
1097.98s - 1104.34s |  So we're going to use their, uh, webpage and we're going to go through
1104.34s - 1108.62s |  it as a way to kind of hit the concepts of MeshTastic and then we're
1108.62s - 1110.36s |  going to loop back and I've got some slides.
1110.36s - 1111.64s |  We'll do a little deeper dive.
1112.10s - 1118.36s |  Um, and my hope is, you know, if I put everybody to sleep, uh, once
1118.36s - 1120.88s |  we get to this section, if you're like, that's it, I can't take any
1120.88s - 1125.28s |  more MeshTastic, you've at least got enough that you can run off and
1125.28s - 1128.20s |  go get your own device and be useful with it.
1128.76s - 1133.72s |  Um, so now what we're going to do is we're going to go to the Lonely Hackers Club.
1134.72s - 1134.96s |  Okay.
1134.96s - 1137.72s |  So, uh, here's updates.
1137.86s - 1140.34s |  So now let me turn back around so we can see everybody.
1142.34s - 1149.42s |  So, uh, MeshTastic is our, is a radio frequency based communications device.
1149.70s - 1151.46s |  It doesn't transport voice.
1151.46s - 1152.78s |  It does text.
1152.86s - 1156.34s |  So, you know, if you think of texting your friends, whatever you're up to,
1157.10s - 1158.06s |  that's how this works.
1158.06s - 1160.70s |  You, you pick somebody and you text them.
1161.12s - 1166.86s |  Now the differentiator here is instead of texting a person per se, your, your
1166.88s - 1171.76s |  node, that's what they call the little device that you carry, your node talks
1171.76s - 1173.84s |  to their node and you can send texts.
1173.88s - 1175.68s |  You can, you know, basically whatever you want.
1176.04s - 1181.76s |  Um, most people are going to use the device hooked up to a cell phone via
1181.76s - 1186.48s |  Bluetooth, um, but you don't have to, there are portable versions of the
1186.48s - 1188.68s |  devices that come with keyboards.
1188.92s - 1192.08s |  One of them is kind of styled after the old style BlackBerry
1192.08s - 1193.84s |  with the integrated keyboard.
1194.34s - 1202.38s |  Um, there are, uh, don't you hate when things pop up on your screen and distract
1202.38s - 1210.60s |  you, um, so they, for Defcon, there's a lot of people that want to bring their
1210.60s - 1216.64s |  devices, one of the other members of DC 858 took their device with them and said
1216.64s - 1221.96s |  they, they hit me in Slack and they said, uh, they left their device in their room
1221.96s - 1223.88s |  for a day, uh, turned on.
1223.88s - 1227.62s |  When they came back, it had already detected like 115 nodes.
1228.06s - 1230.42s |  So, and that was just sitting still in the room.
1230.90s - 1234.54s |  So it sounds like, uh, Defcon is going to be pretty busy when it comes
1234.54s - 1236.14s |  to MeshTastic, which is cool.
1236.42s - 1238.26s |  Now, the thing you see here is a QR code.
1238.54s - 1242.22s |  So what you can do is you can scan a QR code and it will preload
1242.22s - 1243.74s |  settings into your device.
1244.22s - 1247.62s |  So this is the way you don't have to know how to build an engine.
1247.86s - 1250.14s |  You can purchase a MeshTastic device.
1250.56s - 1254.52s |  And then if you have your friend, who's the Mesh, boy, I'm going to
1254.52s - 1259.28s |  get tired of saying MeshTastic, it is the wizard, they can put together
1259.28s - 1261.60s |  the configuration that would be the right thing.
1261.60s - 1264.32s |  And then you scan the code and you're both on the same page.
1264.64s - 1269.00s |  So this is like they say here, this is what you use before Defcon.
1270.36s - 1273.72s |  Uh, you'll hear words like channel, and then there's this
1273.72s - 1275.32s |  thing over here, long, fast.
1275.58s - 1279.72s |  These are different encoding schemes that are made for different things.
1279.72s - 1284.64s |  Long, fast is meant to be used for longer distances, which is
1284.64s - 1288.18s |  where the long comes from, but still be the fast version.
1288.48s - 1291.58s |  I think there's like a long, slow, but it's, you know, it's like
1291.62s - 1295.74s |  backing down to 300 baud if you're super far apart.
1296.10s - 1300.34s |  And then, so you want to make sure that every last bit of information
1300.34s - 1302.14s |  is squeezed out of the signal.
1302.50s - 1306.22s |  So, but when you get the Defcon, oops, I'm trying to scroll
1306.22s - 1307.74s |  the screen there, let's go this one.
1308.68s - 1312.92s |  So when you get the Defcon, they say, use this one.
1313.56s - 1318.52s |  So this one's using short, fast, and then it has other optimizations
1318.76s - 1321.84s |  so that your device will do better when it's surrounded
1321.84s - 1323.68s |  by a sea of other devices.
1324.72s - 1327.08s |  And then the Lonely Hackers Club also have their own
1327.08s - 1329.36s |  channel, the LHC channel.
1329.70s - 1335.20s |  So that's the other cool thing with Meshtastic, there are, uh, it
1335.20s - 1338.86s |  comes with a default configuration, which, you know, you can change
1338.86s - 1343.86s |  it however you want, but the default, then if you like, say you buy
1343.86s - 1348.34s |  one of these devices and there's some other caveats, so we'll get
1348.34s - 1351.50s |  there, but you buy one of these devices from Amazon and lands, you
1351.50s - 1353.86s |  pick it up and then you turn it on.
1354.50s - 1357.34s |  Everybody, for the most part that I've seen, and I'm in Southern
1357.34s - 1362.94s |  California and, uh, last count, I think the max we got to was like
1362.96s - 1369.48s |  350 nodes, but that spans from the border all the way up to like Simi
1369.48s - 1375.16s |  Valley and because of the lot of work of a lot of people, um, you can
1375.16s - 1378.24s |  actually send a message from one end and it will make it up to the
1378.24s - 1382.12s |  other end and that's, you know, that's probably 150, 200 miles.
1382.56s - 1385.44s |  Um, so, but that's the default channel.
1385.62s - 1387.96s |  If you want your own private channel for you to talk to your
1387.96s - 1389.64s |  friends with, you can make that.
1389.86s - 1393.82s |  So you give it a channel name, then you come, it will generate a
1393.82s - 1395.70s |  pre-shared key, you can use your own.
1396.06s - 1400.50s |  And then, uh, like this shows secondary because for the most part, you
1400.50s - 1403.86s |  want to leave the primary channel alone, unless you understand what
1403.86s - 1406.02s |  you're up to and then basically you can do whatever you want.
1406.70s - 1409.98s |  Um, now I'm trying to scroll the screen again.
1410.98s - 1412.78s |  So, so what, yeah.
1412.82s - 1414.34s |  So what is Meshtastic?
1414.58s - 1418.54s |  It's a project lets you use inexpensive battery powered, long range radios
1418.76s - 1421.00s |  to send messages and GPS locations.
1421.40s - 1427.88s |  So, and it's open source and it started out on the ESP 32 hardware platform.
1428.36s - 1433.48s |  It uses Laura as a radio standard, which is also used by, uh,
1433.48s - 1435.32s |  helium and some other things.
1435.68s - 1439.08s |  So you may have familiarity with that kind of stuff already.
1439.52s - 1440.80s |  So, okay, cool.
1441.04s - 1442.68s |  So now that sounds cool.
1442.68s - 1443.96s |  What do I need to get started?
1444.04s - 1447.48s |  Well, you need a device and they have some good guidance here.
1447.74s - 1450.66s |  They're, they have different chip sets in them.
1451.02s - 1455.42s |  Uh, if you go with the ESP 32 and they're recommending the S3 version
1455.42s - 1460.18s |  nowadays, that lets you do Bluetooth or wifi, which is handy if you want
1460.18s - 1465.42s |  to put a fixed note at home and talk to it over your network, um, there's
1465.42s - 1468.86s |  NRF 52, which are much more power efficient.
1469.14s - 1471.78s |  So those tend to show up in portable devices.
1472.38s - 1475.90s |  And so then you need a battery, you need a USB cable, you need a
1475.90s - 1480.12s |  computer, um, because these have firmware and because this is open
1480.12s - 1484.52s |  source, there's a lot of motivated folks that are working on the firmware.
1484.52s - 1486.32s |  And so the firmware gets updated.
1487.20s - 1493.20s |  I won't say every few days, but you know, let's say weekly, uh, roughly.
1493.56s - 1495.20s |  And it doesn't sit static.
1495.20s - 1498.56s |  I mean, there's a lot of active development going on because
1498.56s - 1502.60s |  of the more people use things, the more they want to fix stuff or whatever.
1503.14s - 1505.66s |  Uh, they're, they're talking about using a phone to connect to your
1505.66s - 1508.18s |  device, which you can do in a little later.
1508.18s - 1510.38s |  We'll I'll show different clients.
1510.82s - 1513.14s |  Uh, they're talking about Android and iOS clients.
1513.18s - 1515.14s |  There's also a web enabled client.
1515.14s - 1521.46s |  If you're having it to an internet antenna, um, if anybody is already
1521.46s - 1526.02s |  in RF net, you realize you can go down a rabbit hole on antennas.
1526.54s - 1530.86s |  And, uh, I'm trying to think if I, I don't have a picture on set.
1531.80s - 1532.04s |  Okay.
1532.04s - 1532.96s |  I got to know it now.
1532.96s - 1535.00s |  What, well, you put it all together.
1535.84s - 1538.68s |  Now we're going to head over to the mesh plastic flasher and we
1538.68s - 1540.72s |  can actually do that right here.
1541.24s - 1543.16s |  So this is the website.
1543.52s - 1548.36s |  If you're running Chrome or edge, if you want to flash your device,
1548.36s - 1553.88s |  meaning updated firmware, then you could come here, select target device.
1553.96s - 1557.60s |  And this is also a way to tell what is out there for hardware.
1558.00s - 1560.24s |  So you can see there's a lot of different things.
1560.54s - 1563.70s |  There's a company called health tech that has a bunch of different things.
1563.90s - 1565.14s |  They're nice and portable.
1565.30s - 1568.04s |  Some of them have E Ink screens and are pretty cute.
1568.42s - 1570.82s |  Um, Lily go makes a bunch of stuff.
1571.10s - 1577.54s |  The T beans are nicer unitized packages, E Ink screen, um, built in batteries.
1578.06s - 1583.18s |  The other thing, some of these can do or come equipped with, you can
1583.18s - 1584.82s |  have sensors for various things.
1585.42s - 1589.86s |  You can have a sensor for temperature, pressure, uh, humidity,
1590.16s - 1594.72s |  and there's also one that's, uh, I forget the, is it Bosch?
1594.76s - 1596.96s |  I think it's a Bosch air quality sensor.
1597.32s - 1600.20s |  And then, so it'll tell you, tell you air quality.
1600.78s - 1605.76s |  And instead of telling you it's, you know, 500 meg ohms resistance, they've
1605.76s - 1607.28s |  actually put the curves in there.
1607.28s - 1611.04s |  So it'll give you the number that you might see on an actual
1611.04s - 1613.44s |  device made for air quality.
1613.92s - 1617.58s |  And with any luck, uh, I got some screen snips so I can show that.
1617.92s - 1619.60s |  Uh, so Lily go makes good stuff.
1619.96s - 1626.32s |  I've got a Nano G1, I've got a Station G1 and G2.
1626.68s - 1632.92s |  Actually, I got to work with our local ham radio club, Palomar amateur
1632.96s - 1638.84s |  radio club, and they put the Station G1 up on the repeater site that's
1638.84s - 1643.36s |  up on top of Mount Palomar, which is right around 5,500 feet.
1643.92s - 1646.02s |  And so that gives some pretty good coverage.
1646.08s - 1649.32s |  Now the thing with San Diego, it's hilly, so it's got lots of canyons.
1649.58s - 1651.30s |  So you could still be in a dead zone.
1651.74s - 1655.50s |  Um, so anyway, you can see there's a lot of different hardware here.
1655.56s - 1662.46s |  So before I get off topic there, so basically you flash it by going to that
1662.46s - 1665.06s |  website and you put it together.
1665.06s - 1669.38s |  And one thing to be aware of, always hook the antenna up first, don't
1669.38s - 1670.82s |  power it on without the antenna.
1671.22s - 1675.10s |  Depending on how much power it puts out, it could actually burn itself up.
1675.74s - 1678.82s |  Um, so you hook up the antenna and then you're on the mesh.
1679.20s - 1681.80s |  And then, yeah, they talk about the client role.
1682.68s - 1684.92s |  We'll get into these details shortly.
1685.04s - 1687.28s |  So now we'll go back to the slide deck.
1687.44s - 1688.52s |  So what else do we have here?
1688.56s - 1688.84s |  Okay.
1688.84s - 1689.96s |  So that's concepts.
1690.00s - 1690.44s |  Perfect.
1690.92s - 1694.08s |  Um, now let's see, what do I have?
1694.12s - 1694.36s |  Yeah.
1694.36s - 1694.76s |  Okay.
1694.92s - 1699.08s |  So top title I had was something, something mesh-tastic Pip-Boy
1699.70s - 1702.04s |  and, uh, back into me being silly.
1702.62s - 1709.38s |  Uh, I, and I've never played the, uh, Fallout game, which is, I
1709.38s - 1710.94s |  believe, where Pip-Boy comes from.
1711.38s - 1714.58s |  But I started playing with this and so on everybody, uh, in
1714.58s - 1716.98s |  DEF CON groups, discord, Hey, check it out.
1717.38s - 1719.26s |  I can make a wearable device.
1719.26s - 1721.26s |  And somebody was like, that looks like a Pip-Boy.
1721.66s - 1723.94s |  So that's where the Pip-Boy part came from.
1724.22s - 1728.98s |  But in this case, this is the, uh, B&Q company.
1729.40s - 1731.30s |  They make the Nano G2 Ultra.
1731.36s - 1734.52s |  There's actually a built-in antenna in here that's good
1734.52s - 1738.28s |  for, uh, quite a few different bands.
1738.48s - 1743.40s |  So if you wanted to buy a straightforward device, you don't have to play with
1743.64s - 1745.80s |  hooking antennas to it and doing all that kind of stuff.
1746.24s - 1748.04s |  Um, this is one way you could do it.
1748.24s - 1750.04s |  Now you wouldn't necessarily wear it.
1750.40s - 1755.18s |  Uh, that's just me being silly, but it's made to be put in a pocket and
1755.18s - 1760.66s |  it's actually built to account for the physical properties of the human
1760.66s - 1765.46s |  body when you have a transmitting device next to it, and it accounts
1765.46s - 1769.36s |  for that so that your antenna doesn't just spend all this time trying to
1769.36s - 1773.44s |  heat your, uh, whatever is under the pocket, you know, where you put the thing.
1773.84s - 1775.18s |  So that's kind of fun.
1775.24s - 1777.10s |  So that, that, uh, that's our Pip-Boy.
1777.50s - 1784.38s |  So distance, um, Meshtastic is very line of sight dependent.
1785.02s - 1790.74s |  And so as long as you have that in mind, you can get some pretty good distances.
1790.74s - 1795.54s |  Now, this device you see right here, I use that at work last week.
1796.10s - 1798.42s |  And when I did, I put it in a paper cup.
1798.46s - 1800.10s |  I put it on top of my car.
1800.54s - 1803.90s |  Now I figured out there's a sweet spot in the parking structure, which
1803.90s - 1805.66s |  is a four-story parking structure.
1806.22s - 1813.02s |  And it happens to be a great place to pick up stuff being sent from Long Beach,
1813.02s - 1816.86s |  which is up the coast from us, uh, cause I'm in San Diego.
1816.90s - 1818.50s |  So Long Beach is up the coast.
1819.14s - 1826.62s |  And so what I did was, now what we see here is, uh, so you see the battleship
1826.94s - 1832.02s |  USS Iowa, that's up in Long Beach and it's right on the edge of the water.
1833.22s - 1838.94s |  So now I'm inland where I work, but it turns out it's a straight
1838.94s - 1843.46s |  shot up from where I am to this.
1844.26s - 1847.30s |  And so here's my DCGVR Pip-Boy.
1847.62s - 1851.66s |  So I'm sitting at my desk with Wasp, a little nod to
1851.66s - 1853.18s |  the girl with the dragon tattoo.
1853.58s - 1855.78s |  Um, you'll see a different slide in a little bit.
1855.78s - 1858.30s |  We have Plague and Wasp talking to each other.
1858.98s - 1864.62s |  Uh, DCGVR Pip-Boy reached out and directly hit the battleship Iowa,
1864.66s - 1866.90s |  which has a node on the battleship.
1867.50s - 1873.58s |  So now based on my Google map clicking, that's 88 miles.
1874.18s - 1878.94s |  So one device talking to another device, this particular device has a hundred
1878.94s - 1885.86s |  milliwatts and that may not mean anything, but figure that's like, uh, you
1885.86s - 1890.14s |  know, your little, uh, if you've got any of those family radio things where your
1890.14s - 1893.78s |  kids talk to each other on the walkie talkie, it's that kind of power level.
1893.78s - 1899.50s |  It's really low, but this goes 88 miles if you put it in the right spot.
1899.86s - 1902.94s |  So there's definite usefulness here.
1903.26s - 1908.42s |  And so what you can do, you know, we have some use cases coming up,
1908.42s - 1915.46s |  but you can, you know, think of it, say, uh, regular communication lines
1915.46s - 1920.58s |  were down, not that you're going to base your sole way to save
1920.58s - 1925.66s |  yourself on a metastatic device, but you can get 88 miles if you
1925.66s - 1927.22s |  got stuff set up in the right spot.
1927.62s - 1928.98s |  Um, what else we got here?
1929.02s - 1929.26s |  Okay.
1929.26s - 1931.26s |  So hardware, we covered a lot of this already.
1931.70s - 1935.78s |  Um, one thing to be aware of, make sure you purchase the correct
1935.78s - 1937.62s |  frequency for the region you're in.
1937.98s - 1941.38s |  United States uses 915 megahertz.
1941.98s - 1948.14s |  The, uh, I forget, I think the UK is 866 megahertz.
1948.42s - 1953.34s |  I forget he uses 433 megahertz, but there are different, uh,
1953.38s - 1955.10s |  frequency ranges you can purchase.
1955.30s - 1958.50s |  So if you got all excited and got on Amazon and went and bought one, the
1958.50s - 1962.46s |  first one you saw, uh, and you get at home and you can't talk to anybody,
1962.62s - 1967.98s |  you might find out you got, uh, 433 megahertz device or something like that.
1969.22s - 1970.42s |  So we talked about this.
1970.66s - 1975.22s |  Another thing to be mindful of, uh, I'm not sure how many folks have
1975.22s - 1981.98s |  played with the RTL SDR devices that let, you know, basically they are
1982.22s - 1988.50s |  kind of upgraded, souped up digital TV devices from, I think it was Europe
1988.54s - 1990.06s |  where they were mostly started out.
1990.50s - 1992.10s |  And then folks realized, Hey, you know what?
1992.10s - 1994.38s |  We could program these and you can pick up all kinds of stuff.
1994.86s - 1996.90s |  So they use the same kind of connector.
1996.90s - 1999.14s |  Mostly that's the SMA connector.
1999.50s - 2002.70s |  The thing to keep in mind, some SMA connectors.
2003.46s - 2005.94s |  Have a receptacle and some have a pin.
2006.34s - 2012.14s |  And so you don't want to SMA devices with receptacles because there's
2012.14s - 2016.78s |  nothing to carry the conductor that's current between the two devices.
2017.10s - 2021.42s |  Nor do you want to try to get two devices that both have pins because
2021.42s - 2023.10s |  they won't be able to connect together.
2024.30s - 2026.14s |  We talked about line of sight already.
2026.62s - 2028.66s |  Um, let's see what else we got clients.
2028.66s - 2028.98s |  Okay.
2028.98s - 2030.70s |  So now we get to do some more show and tell.
2031.14s - 2034.50s |  Um, so Android client and you know what?
2034.50s - 2036.14s |  I'm staring at my own slide deck.
2037.02s - 2040.54s |  Does anybody got any questions or wants me to speak up?
2040.58s - 2041.46s |  Slow down.
2042.66s - 2043.42s |  Go home.
2045.59s - 2045.99s |  Okay.
2046.07s - 2047.23s |  That's not okay.
2047.55s - 2048.31s |  We press on.
2048.87s - 2052.12s |  Um, okay.
2052.12s - 2058.72s |  So Android client, iOS client, there's a web client and there's a programmatic client.
2059.36s - 2066.96s |  So if you buy a device that is the ESP, uh, guts, you, it has wifi.
2066.96s - 2068.56s |  So you can hook it up to your wifi.
2068.92s - 2072.84s |  And so I've done that with a live, with a machine on the floor over here.
2073.08s - 2076.32s |  So let's see if this is yeah.
2076.44s - 2077.04s |  So, okay.
2077.04s - 2078.52s |  So you're still talking to me here.
2078.68s - 2082.56s |  Let's try this guy and I'm jumping a little forward here.
2082.60s - 2086.32s |  So we'll do a little demo, but so you can see a lot of the devices
2086.32s - 2090.64s |  that are around where I'm at and there's okay.
2090.64s - 2091.48s |  Google remote.
2091.48s - 2092.44s |  Hi, Google remote.
2092.92s - 2097.32s |  This one's actually one that's configured for Defcon and using a different technology
2097.32s - 2100.44s |  MQTT to be able to be picked up by this guy.
2101.24s - 2104.68s |  And then, so yeah, we've got a few devices going on.
2105.08s - 2114.64s |  Um, what I've got it configured for here is somebody has written a BBS for these
2114.64s - 2115.24s |  devices.
2115.24s - 2117.32s |  Now I'm going to start jumping around in my slides here.
2117.32s - 2118.84s |  So I'm going to get down here a little bit.
2119.56s - 2119.92s |  Where'd he go?
2119.92s - 2120.44s |  I overshot.
2121.52s - 2121.84s |  Oh yeah.
2121.84s - 2122.32s |  We're doing live.
2122.52s - 2122.80s |  Okay.
2122.88s - 2123.84s |  I thought it was screenshot.
2124.36s - 2127.92s |  Um, and so what we can, what we can do.
2128.64s - 2137.18s |  So if I send something now, don't fail me, wakey, wakey, please.
2137.70s - 2138.26s |  There we go.
2138.34s - 2138.78s |  Okay.
2139.02s - 2140.74s |  So now the BBS is talking to us.
2140.98s - 2144.06s |  So it says, uh, use the first letter for the command.
2144.30s - 2150.14s |  So what I just did was I send a direct message from Giglio to Zardoz and I know
2150.14s - 2151.82s |  actually said Zardoz once today.
2151.82s - 2153.42s |  So funny how that works.
2153.78s - 2157.18s |  Um, so what we're going to do is we're going to do B for BBS.
2157.22s - 2158.14s |  So here we go.
2158.70s - 2161.02s |  Please lengthen this text to two characters.
2162.30s - 2167.28s |  Well, it looks like they got some work to do on, on the web client.
2167.92s - 2168.96s |  Let's see if it'll even work.
2171.69s - 2172.33s |  Of course not.
2172.41s - 2172.97s |  Ha ha.
2173.01s - 2173.53s |  Oh, there it goes.
2173.53s - 2173.77s |  Good.
2174.29s - 2178.97s |  Uh, so we're doing the BBS except it didn't recognize it as a command.
2179.05s - 2179.81s |  That's awesome.
2180.17s - 2180.49s |  Okay.
2180.49s - 2182.85s |  So demo failed due to lack of testing.
2183.45s - 2189.93s |  Um, anyway, what it does is it gets us to, do I have that in mind?
2191.41s - 2193.21s |  I might have that farther down.
2193.21s - 2193.69s |  Let's go see.
2195.05s - 2196.73s |  Let's see if I did that.
2196.73s - 2197.85s |  That's nope.
2198.33s - 2198.89s |  There we are.
2199.13s - 2200.33s |  So here's the BBS.
2200.65s - 2203.09s |  Um, here's what the server side looks like.
2203.09s - 2204.25s |  We could get something in.
2204.53s - 2209.37s |  So over here is what we were just trying to do, which turns out the web client failed.
2209.89s - 2212.73s |  Um, so you send a B, okay.
2212.73s - 2213.49s |  You get the menu.
2213.85s - 2215.65s |  Send another B says, what would you like?
2215.65s - 2216.61s |  Which bulletin board?
2216.97s - 2217.21s |  Okay.
2217.21s - 2218.09s |  We have four.
2218.33s - 2219.37s |  So, okay.
2219.41s - 2221.05s |  I'd like the general one, please.
2221.33s - 2223.01s |  What would you like to do to the general board?
2223.09s - 2223.57s |  Read.
2223.77s - 2224.29s |  Cool.
2224.61s - 2225.85s |  Which number would you like?
2225.89s - 2226.29s |  One.
2226.29s - 2226.77s |  Okay.
2227.01s - 2227.25s |  All right.
2227.25s - 2228.65s |  Test post in general board.
2228.69s - 2229.01s |  Cool.
2229.13s - 2237.81s |  So you could conceivably build this out and use it to store and forward messages or whatever kind
2237.81s - 2242.65s |  of stuff you want to do for extra functionality that wouldn't be real time based.
2243.73s - 2248.97s |  So you could just bake this into whatever your use cases you're playing with or trying to support.
2249.53s - 2253.65s |  So, uh, now we're going to go back up to talk about the rest of the clients.
2253.73s - 2254.09s |  Okay.
2254.13s - 2257.37s |  So there's an Android client and iOS client.
2257.41s - 2258.89s |  We already played with the web client.
2259.69s - 2261.13s |  And we're doing okay in time.
2261.37s - 2262.77s |  So here's the iOS client.
2263.25s - 2265.97s |  The iOS client is very pretty.
2266.61s - 2270.81s |  It, you know, it's very colorful, got all kinds of cool stuff.
2271.05s - 2276.81s |  Now, just so it turns out that the top device is the one that had the picture sitting on my wrist.
2276.81s - 2278.93s |  So that's the DCG VR Pip boy.
2279.49s - 2282.89s |  Um, and this is the list of devices that's around me.
2283.13s - 2287.57s |  And you can tell this was last night I was snipping these screenshots.
2287.89s - 2289.77s |  So then we got plague.
2289.97s - 2292.25s |  Now we don't have wasp handy.
2292.69s - 2296.61s |  Uh, because I think I turned, yeah, I turned the wasp into Giglio.
2296.89s - 2302.69s |  So, uh, but we got, this is, that's my ham radio call sign.
2303.25s - 2305.57s |  And this device itself is actually.
2306.17s - 2313.25s |  Uh, outside my house with a four foot Laura antenna so that it can help fill
2313.25s - 2315.25s |  in the mesh up where I'm at.
2315.73s - 2320.01s |  Um, but say we pick plague and we go into plague.
2320.29s - 2325.09s |  So plague is a BNO stage or BNQ station G2.
2325.61s - 2329.29s |  And it, you know, here's how long it's been up all its stats.
2329.49s - 2332.01s |  I've actually got one of those modules plugged into it.
2332.25s - 2336.85s |  So at the time I snipped this one 13 and this one happens to be in my garage.
2337.13s - 2343.17s |  It's 89 degrees in the garage, 47% humidity, 105.56 millibars.
2343.21s - 2346.61s |  And up here is our air quality, which is likely polluted.
2346.93s - 2349.81s |  Now, if we went to the one in the backyard, it's pretty much always
2349.81s - 2354.21s |  green because it's outdoors, but being Southern California, it's
2354.21s - 2357.21s |  possible it could change, you know, if we started having fires or something.
2358.13s - 2362.81s |  Uh, so more menu configuration stuff over here, then it also
2362.81s - 2365.05s |  has environmental metrics.
2365.09s - 2367.57s |  It has device metrics and it makes pretty charts.
2367.65s - 2370.17s |  So you can kind of track things over time, which is pretty slick.
2370.65s - 2375.21s |  So this is the iOS client and it's, I'd say it's really great for folks
2375.21s - 2377.17s |  that don't want to tinker as much.
2377.73s - 2381.01s |  And because there are some things you can't do from here.
2381.29s - 2383.77s |  So now we're going to move and look at the Android client.
2383.89s - 2387.09s |  So here's the Android client seeing much the same stuff.
2387.73s - 2390.77s |  And you can see it's got, you know, DCGVR Pip boy.
2391.33s - 2396.85s |  It's got what the device is, uh, battery status and voltage, and then
2396.93s - 2398.57s |  what kind of channel utilization.
2398.93s - 2400.49s |  Here's our buddy plague again.
2400.81s - 2405.37s |  Now it's got same stuff here, but it doesn't take you a nice, pretty screen.
2405.81s - 2410.25s |  Uh, my assumption is there are different dev teams for this.
2410.25s - 2415.45s |  I know the one that works on iOS client, his name's Garth and there's other folks.
2416.73s - 2418.85s |  We mentioned channels earlier.
2419.17s - 2424.37s |  So you can see that for DCGVR Pip boy long, fast, this is the default
2424.37s - 2426.33s |  channel that ships with every device.
2427.09s - 2430.17s |  Admin, you can actually do remote admin of devices.
2430.41s - 2434.37s |  So say you had a device that's up on the top of a mountain and it
2434.37s - 2436.17s |  takes you an hour to drive there.
2436.45s - 2440.53s |  But because of its placement, you can hit it directly from
2440.53s - 2442.25s |  your home, say 30 miles away.
2443.21s - 2446.25s |  You can remotely administer it from 30 miles away.
2446.65s - 2447.85s |  So that's what this is.
2447.85s - 2451.69s |  What it does is it puts administration commands and ships it over this channel,
2451.73s - 2454.85s |  which is protected by its own encryption key.
2455.37s - 2459.45s |  And then the device on the other end gets it and says, yeah, okay.
2459.61s - 2460.53s |  You know, it decrypts.
2460.53s - 2461.41s |  I know what to do with it.
2461.41s - 2462.09s |  It's a command.
2462.33s - 2463.45s |  I perform the command.
2464.01s - 2467.09s |  Uh, this was somebody fooling around when they made a second
2467.21s - 2468.85s |  channel called secret cabal.
2468.93s - 2469.65s |  Okay, cool.
2470.05s - 2477.29s |  Uh, park is the ham radio amateur radio club I mentioned earlier.
2477.45s - 2479.29s |  So we built the channel for them.
2479.45s - 2482.01s |  We haven't got to where we're sharing with people yet.
2482.33s - 2486.97s |  So me and the DC eight, five, eight person who's also part of the
2486.97s - 2491.89s |  Palomar amateur radio club, uh, can send messages over this.
2493.01s - 2494.85s |  Then I did DCGVR.
2495.21s - 2499.13s |  So that's for our group, but there's also a contingent that's
2499.21s - 2502.85s |  in DEF CON, uh, today, right on site.
2503.13s - 2507.77s |  Now, none of them are mesh tastic nerds, but there's other channels
2507.77s - 2512.09s |  like we were looking at with the LHC folks, the lonely hackers
2512.09s - 2513.85s |  club, they have their own channel.
2514.33s - 2521.13s |  So now I can't from here, talk over RF to Las Vegas.
2521.37s - 2524.77s |  It's, I mean, it might be possible, but it's unlikely
2524.77s - 2526.65s |  because I live near an airport.
2526.65s - 2529.77s |  I'm not going to put a 3000 foot tower up to try to
2529.77s - 2531.37s |  overcome whatever's going on.
2531.89s - 2534.61s |  And to that point, I'm jumping around on you and forgive me.
2534.65s - 2537.69s |  Let's see, um, this thing here.
2538.77s - 2542.69s |  So the, say you have two points and you want to know
2542.69s - 2543.61s |  if you can get to them.
2544.21s - 2548.77s |  There are SCADA, somebody with OT experience.
2548.77s - 2550.09s |  So I have to tell me how to say it right.
2550.61s - 2553.93s |  But basically you could put in the GPS coordinates of the locations.
2554.37s - 2558.21s |  And this thing has the terrain mapping and can basically tell you if
2558.21s - 2559.69s |  what you're trying to do is possible.
2560.05s - 2564.45s |  So what you can see is, uh, my, my thing from work, which is
2564.45s - 2569.97s |  going to be the green guy going to the USS Iowa, which is a sea level.
2571.01s - 2571.29s |  Yeah.
2571.33s - 2571.81s |  Look at that.
2571.81s - 2573.25s |  We're up high, they're down low.
2573.29s - 2576.53s |  And because there's nothing in the way and it's out over water.
2576.53s - 2578.73s |  So there's probably not a lot of electrical noise.
2579.33s - 2580.33s |  It should be doable.
2580.37s - 2583.05s |  Turns out it is that's 141 kilometers.
2583.41s - 2586.81s |  So that's not bad for, uh, something you can put in your pocket.
2587.33s - 2588.77s |  Uh, so back over here.
2588.81s - 2589.05s |  Okay.
2589.05s - 2592.29s |  So we're looking at clients, we're looking at clients.
2592.61s - 2595.65s |  So here's some more config detail stuff, which I don't think is
2595.65s - 2597.53s |  really worth digging into.
2597.89s - 2601.41s |  Uh, cause then we're getting into nuts and bolts and you're at the
2601.41s - 2606.29s |  level where you're basically, uh, if you're a car person, you're
2606.29s - 2610.41s |  trying to like update the firmware on the computer in your car type of thing.
2610.97s - 2613.29s |  Uh, we did a web client demo.
2613.61s - 2615.13s |  So what else have we got going here?
2615.37s - 2615.61s |  Yeah.
2615.61s - 2615.85s |  Okay.
2615.85s - 2616.77s |  So MQTT.
2617.77s - 2623.21s |  So what MQTT does, and I'm sure a bunch of you out there recognize what MQTT
2623.25s - 2626.61s |  means, and let me turn around so I can see everybody again.
2627.05s - 2632.05s |  Uh, basically it's a mechanism for transporting traffic and activity.
2632.45s - 2637.77s |  And then, uh, with a backend database that is able to take that and act upon
2637.77s - 2639.13s |  it and people hooked up to it.
2639.57s - 2644.21s |  And then, uh, you can, you know, basically direct things to happen or
2644.21s - 2646.29s |  collect data, whatever you're happy to be onto.
2646.93s - 2654.01s |  In this case, I'm using it as a transport to be able to, uh, so the device
2654.01s - 2658.81s |  Gigolo remote is here at home, but it's configured like if I was at Defcon.
2659.53s - 2662.69s |  Now, like I was saying, uh, it's not possible for me to
2662.69s - 2664.25s |  talk to Las Vegas directly.
2664.57s - 2665.61s |  So I got the bright idea.
2665.61s - 2668.97s |  Hey, why don't I stand up an MQTT server?
2669.45s - 2676.01s |  And then I can set my traffic to go out over to the MQTT server, which
2676.05s - 2682.17s |  I signed up with Hive MQ and they have a free service and I think they'll let
2682.17s - 2684.57s |  you do like 10 gig a month on a hundred clients.
2685.13s - 2687.53s |  Uh, so for this kind of stuff, that's pretty cool because there's
2687.53s - 2689.97s |  no way that me sending text.
2690.33s - 2695.49s |  It's not like I have a, uh, uh, you know, a factory of IOT devices or a farm
2695.49s - 2699.13s |  of, uh, sensors collecting information.
2699.65s - 2706.17s |  Um, so the, what you're seeing here is a list of nodes.
2706.41s - 2712.53s |  We're on the Gigolo remote device, but plague wasp and DCGV, our Pip
2712.53s - 2719.17s |  boy are not on the same, uh, RF parameters as this guy, but they share
2719.17s - 2723.65s |  a common channel that we created.
2723.65s - 2726.09s |  And you can see that on the right side of the screen over here,
2726.09s - 2727.85s |  channel two, channel two, channel two.
2728.17s - 2730.65s |  So this device, whatever channel two is.
2730.65s - 2734.77s |  And I think it's the DCGV, our channel is the channel that all these
2734.77s - 2740.57s |  devices traversing through the MQTT server, which if I remember, I'm
2740.57s - 2744.61s |  on some cluster that's in Europe, which is interesting.
2744.97s - 2749.29s |  Um, one of the folks on the team is in Australia.
2749.57s - 2752.33s |  And so we were playing with, if we can get it to work and we
2752.33s - 2753.85s |  didn't the time we tried it.
2754.21s - 2757.05s |  But now that it's working, I don't know, it might be possible.
2757.05s - 2758.49s |  So we may have to revisit that.
2759.01s - 2762.81s |  But anyway, there are ways if you have a geographical area that's
2762.81s - 2767.25s |  using RF to talk to itself, but you want to get that and ship it to
2767.25s - 2770.77s |  someplace else, you can do it using MQTT.
2771.05s - 2777.65s |  If you configure things appropriately, which I, uh, appeared to have
2777.69s - 2782.49s |  stumbled on the proper settings and was able to do so.
2782.93s - 2786.41s |  So now let's go back to what else we got in the slide deck here.
2786.53s - 2792.46s |  Anything interesting in scenarios.
2792.50s - 2792.94s |  Okay.
2793.18s - 2797.10s |  So you have different scenarios.
2797.26s - 2803.34s |  Say you have some friends, um, the burning man festival.
2803.42s - 2806.74s |  I've never been, but I know there's a contingent of folks that
2806.74s - 2808.74s |  take mesh test devices to go there.
2809.02s - 2811.34s |  Or there's a thing called EDC.
2811.66s - 2813.30s |  That's in Las Vegas every year.
2813.30s - 2814.98s |  That has like a hundred thousand people.
2815.42s - 2819.30s |  There are folks that take a mesh testing device there.
2819.66s - 2823.82s |  And so for that, you want to tune it based on the settings that
2823.82s - 2825.54s |  we were talking about over here.
2825.54s - 2829.46s |  And sorry, if I'm jumping around from webpage to webpage, but if
2829.46s - 2834.34s |  we go back over here and we look at those barcodes again, QR codes.
2834.78s - 2839.42s |  So if you're at Defcon, they say use this with their channel.
2839.66s - 2843.38s |  And then there's also other settings that you would then optimize for,
2843.58s - 2849.90s |  which reduces the load on the mesh to allow things to be, to talk to like
2849.98s - 2852.74s |  you wouldn't take a device that's measuring temperature and
2852.74s - 2854.70s |  pressure to this kind of event.
2854.94s - 2859.10s |  It would just hog up the mesh without adding much value.
2860.18s - 2863.82s |  Um, so if you have a larger area, like say you're in kind of, uh,
2863.82s - 2865.18s |  some kind of regional area.
2865.82s - 2870.18s |  You want to get your, you can use long, fast as the encoding scheme.
2870.62s - 2873.38s |  And then you want to get your units up as high as you can,
2873.38s - 2874.82s |  practically speaking, right?
2875.14s - 2878.62s |  You don't want to go breaking into buildings and trying to scale the
2878.62s - 2881.86s |  outside like Spider-Man and put a note up on the roof.
2882.34s - 2886.94s |  Now, if you work for a place with a tall building and you, you know, went and
2886.94s - 2892.10s |  talked to the management people and somehow can Jedi mind them into letting
2892.10s - 2895.70s |  you put the device up on top of the building, that might be a cool thing.
2895.70s - 2899.82s |  If you've got people around you that are trying to use devices such as yours.
2900.70s - 2908.54s |  And then lastly, um, so for Southern California, um, I've been playing
2908.54s - 2912.22s |  with mesh tastic on our, let's say a year, uh, just to come up with a number.
2912.58s - 2916.10s |  There was a point there where I had two nodes and if you're going to play
2916.10s - 2920.50s |  with it yourself as a tinkerer, get two nodes, that way you can tell if
2920.50s - 2923.98s |  you're transmitting and you're receiving, you can talk to yourself.
2924.26s - 2926.74s |  Because if you only have a single node and you think there's going to be
2926.74s - 2930.34s |  people around, then you need to, you know, you want to be able
2930.34s - 2931.54s |  to tell that your stuff's working.
2932.14s - 2934.82s |  Um, but in Southern California, San Diego.
2935.42s - 2939.62s |  There were a bunch of folks and they were mostly ham radio folks, but some
2939.62s - 2944.14s |  of them actually own companies that are responsible for putting those big
2944.14s - 2948.10s |  towers on the tops of mountains that you see microwave links that go over
2948.10s - 2950.10s |  the mountains and that kind of stuff.
2950.38s - 2954.14s |  There's one guy down here, all of his nodes, and now I'm
2954.14s - 2955.38s |  going to jump around some more.
2955.90s - 2957.02s |  Let's see, let's go back over here.
2957.02s - 2959.66s |  Do we have any of the, all your base showing up here?
2959.86s - 2960.22s |  Yeah.
2960.42s - 2963.34s |  So like all these, all your base belong to Chula Vista.
2963.62s - 2966.94s |  That's down close to the border, but not at the border.
2967.30s - 2967.98s |  What else do we got?
2967.98s - 2969.62s |  All your base are belonging to Bonita.
2969.78s - 2971.10s |  That's same general direction.
2971.10s - 2972.50s |  All your base belong to Otay.
2972.54s - 2974.06s |  Now we're getting closer to the border.
2974.54s - 2975.94s |  Uh, San Miguel mountain.
2975.94s - 2977.90s |  I think that's on the Mexican side.
2977.98s - 2980.22s |  Tijuana, that's on the Mexican side.
2980.46s - 2983.90s |  So this person just in this little list we have here, what do we got?
2983.90s - 2990.38s |  Six, seven, uh, base units and his company, he basically has
2990.38s - 2992.62s |  his guys put these up on the towers.
2992.86s - 2997.70s |  So these became the anchor points for most of San Diego area.
2998.50s - 3002.58s |  And some of these things, the one in Otay actually can hit stuff up into LA.
3002.90s - 3008.18s |  So if you get those kinds of folks, then you can get something
3008.70s - 3009.86s |  pretty interesting going on.
3009.94s - 3015.14s |  Otherwise, if you're, you know, a nerd like me and you live someplace, like
3015.14s - 3019.14s |  say you're in an apartment building, if you're on a balcony and if you're up
3019.14s - 3021.42s |  on a couple of stories, that'd be awesome.
3021.42s - 3024.10s |  You could put one out on your balcony and plug it into the
3024.10s - 3025.42s |  outlet out there or something.
3026.02s - 3029.42s |  Um, anyway, so there's cool stuff you can do there.
3029.46s - 3030.10s |  What else we got?
3030.10s - 3031.86s |  We already talked about the BBS.
3032.78s - 3033.50s |  Okay.
3033.50s - 3033.74s |  Yeah.
3033.74s - 3034.78s |  Things to watch out for.
3034.78s - 3035.66s |  We talked about that.
3035.66s - 3039.10s |  Never power up a node without an antenna connected.
3039.70s - 3041.02s |  Um, Oh yeah.
3041.02s - 3042.30s |  One thing I learned the hard way.
3042.46s - 3046.50s |  So the, the, the node that got put on the top of Mount Palomar,
3046.82s - 3049.38s |  because it's a fixed node, it doesn't have a GPS.
3049.66s - 3054.62s |  So we put the, the GPS setting into it and then the team took it up there,
3054.62s - 3058.70s |  put it up on the pole and, you know, configured it up into their UPS
3058.70s - 3059.86s |  room and all that kind of stuff.
3060.38s - 3062.30s |  So, okay, perfect.
3062.42s - 3065.14s |  And then we got looking at where it was on the map.
3065.70s - 3071.70s |  And I believe somebody realized or decided, you know what, we need to make
3071.70s - 3073.26s |  this look like it's farther away.
3073.26s - 3076.06s |  Cause we don't want some dunderhead going up there in the dark and
3076.06s - 3077.86s |  trying to blow up the repeater site.
3078.30s - 3081.94s |  So then we tried to fix it remotely, which it looked like you could.
3081.94s - 3086.54s |  And we tried all manner of, uh, fiendish client mute.
3086.90s - 3090.50s |  They can participate on the mesh and send messages, but they don't
3090.50s - 3095.58s |  act like a device that's trying to forward packets to other devices on the
3095.58s - 3097.66s |  mesh, which is why it's a mesh, right?
3097.66s - 3101.14s |  The more people you have, it extends because you have devices
3101.14s - 3102.70s |  that are forwarding those packets.
3103.14s - 3108.22s |  Um, and then, yeah, only if you maintain a, a tower or something that's got
3108.22s - 3112.98s |  some serious reach capability, then there's modes called router or
3112.98s - 3117.38s |  repeater that you would use, but you wouldn't want to do that if you're
3117.42s - 3120.02s |  like, say you went to one of these events where there's a million people.
3120.38s - 3123.98s |  If you make your device, the router, every other device around you
3123.98s - 3127.14s |  is going to instinctively say, Oh, we got to send our traffic
3127.14s - 3128.70s |  through that device over there.
3129.42s - 3131.62s |  And then nobody's going to have any traffic because your
3131.62s - 3132.94s |  device is going to tip over.
3133.50s - 3138.74s |  So I think that might be kind of where we are now.
3138.74s - 3141.26s |  I don't have any wrap up and I need to put the links together.
3141.58s - 3144.02s |  So, and it's 10 till, so I need to shut up.
3144.34s - 3146.26s |  Um, let me swing back around here.
3147.26s - 3151.18s |  So let's, uh, abruptly go to the question and answer phase.
3151.18s - 3152.50s |  If anybody has any questions.
3153.50s - 3154.06s |  I got one.
3159.57s - 3160.09s |  Go for it.
3160.89s - 3164.53s |  Uh, did you ever use it to like, uh, make a, I know, uh, some kind of
3164.53s - 3166.97s |  robot or something, a remote control boat.
3167.29s - 3171.17s |  I'm thinking like you can create a swarm of robots, for example, to
3171.21s - 3176.21s |  investigate like underwater caves and maybe even use something in low orbit.
3176.21s - 3179.89s |  Like if they can talk to each other and how fast the communication happens.
3180.61s - 3186.81s |  Yeah, I mean, I think the way that may very well be possible because they have,
3186.89s - 3192.89s |  uh, Python, uh, libraries, I guess would be the right term.
3192.93s - 3194.69s |  I'm not a Python person, so forgive me.
3195.01s - 3199.89s |  Um, but there are, you basically can write up your own stuff if you want to.
3200.13s - 3202.37s |  So it's conceivable you could do that.
3202.77s - 3207.37s |  Now you would have to, you know, figure out how you control your stuff
3207.37s - 3209.17s |  because remember this is text based.
3209.45s - 3214.97s |  So if you're sending a text message to the other device, then something's got to
3214.97s - 3218.49s |  consume it and know what to do with it, you know, and then you'd end up with some
3218.49s - 3221.01s |  kind of navigation and steering and all that kind of stuff.
3221.33s - 3226.45s |  So I don't know that anybody's used much tastic for that, uh, specifically.
3226.69s - 3230.45s |  The underlying Laura though, the radio frequency, which is a
3230.49s - 3234.97s |  Laura though, the radio frequency component of it, the, if you transport,
3234.97s - 3239.69s |  if you will, and Laura is spread spectrum frequency hopping.
3240.41s - 3244.93s |  And so that's what is also kind of cool because it's not like somebody can get on
3245.01s - 3248.69s |  one channel and then obliterate everybody around them.
3249.17s - 3255.05s |  So, um, I'm not sure who's used what cool use cases for things, but I know there
3255.05s - 3260.85s |  are a bot in a, I won't say a chat bot, cause that is taken on a way different
3260.85s - 3266.37s |  meaning that, um, but if you send things to it and I think that was even on the
3266.37s - 3270.49s |  LHC, uh, let's see the LHC website.
3270.49s - 3273.53s |  Do I have it go back over here?
3273.53s - 3275.37s |  LHC, uh, this one.
3275.77s - 3276.05s |  Yeah.
3276.05s - 3277.97s |  They talked about having a bot.
3278.21s - 3278.53s |  Yeah.
3278.53s - 3283.97s |  Reach out to our bot by sending a direct message to the main node.
3284.25s - 3286.13s |  Uh, and that's the node ID.
3286.37s - 3288.97s |  You can ask about your signal quality and other info.
3289.17s - 3295.33s |  So there are people that are writing stuff that would, you know, use MeshTastic
3295.33s - 3299.45s |  as a transport for some kind of automation or other, whatever you got.
3299.45s - 3300.09s |  Yeah, exactly.
3300.09s - 3301.69s |  That, that's what I was thinking.
3302.33s - 3302.53s |  Yeah.
3302.53s - 3306.41s |  Because I went on the website, I saw like Raspberry Pi and other things.
3306.41s - 3308.45s |  So I thought maybe it'd be taken further.
3309.09s - 3309.97s |  Well, yeah, for sure.
3310.01s - 3315.85s |  And here, let me, uh, jump back over to where the hell is my thing.
3316.17s - 3319.85s |  If we go back over to the flasher and you have this list of stuff right down at the
3319.85s - 3322.81s |  bottom is the Raspberry Pi Pico based things.
3323.17s - 3327.37s |  So the company called Rack, they make things with whiz blocks.
3327.57s - 3333.01s |  So you'll see the Rack whiz block this, that what that is, is a modular setup.
3333.69s - 3335.65s |  So think of them as building blocks.
3335.65s - 3339.97s |  And so you look at what you want and you, you know, you want a GPS.
3339.97s - 3340.21s |  Okay.
3340.21s - 3341.61s |  You buy the GPS module.
3341.61s - 3342.53s |  You want something else?
3342.53s - 3343.49s |  You buy that module.
3343.69s - 3347.01s |  They plug together and then you basically assemble the unit.
3347.37s - 3353.17s |  And then a lot of people, uh, there's folks on Etsy will do 3d printing of
3353.17s - 3357.17s |  cases for these various devices, and then you're good to go, but the
3357.17s - 3359.01s |  Raspberry Pi also has them too.
3359.21s - 3361.57s |  So my guess is that some of these.
3362.25s - 3366.13s |  Um, and I've barely scratched the surface on Raspberry Pi stuff, but there would
3366.13s - 3370.49s |  have to be a Laura hat of some sort that is, yeah, they have shields.
3370.89s - 3371.65s |  Yeah, exactly.
3371.65s - 3372.01s |  Shield.
3372.01s - 3372.29s |  Okay.
3372.29s - 3373.05s |  Use the right term.
3373.25s - 3377.89s |  Um, so yeah, so that's, you know, many things are possible.
3377.89s - 3379.49s |  You just have to figure out how you want to do it.
3381.41s - 3383.13s |  I don't know about the underwater part.
3383.25s - 3385.85s |  Uh, RF works differently when you get underwater.
3386.21s - 3390.21s |  So, yeah, I wanted to know about that because I did see a project, like, uh,
3390.25s - 3393.09s |  someone made a self-driving boat basically.
3393.09s - 3396.33s |  And it was a transmit against a GPS location back then.
3396.77s - 3399.05s |  It was like following the coastline and something.
3399.05s - 3400.37s |  I don't remember the channel though.
3401.01s - 3402.05s |  You'll find it.
3402.05s - 3403.53s |  I'll maybe send it to you on this board.
3403.57s - 3403.89s |  Yeah.
3403.93s - 3404.41s |  Go for it.
3404.73s - 3407.05s |  And, uh, be careful when you talk about it.
3407.05s - 3408.89s |  Cause then the DEA will come after you.
3413.41s - 3419.89s |  There is one handy way to, uh, talk to underwater vehicles via RF and that's
3419.89s - 3423.49s |  for the vehicle to trail a floating wire, uh, antenna.
3423.69s - 3427.21s |  And basically it's just a wire, a long wire that floats.
3427.21s - 3431.61s |  It reels out as it dives and it goes up to the surface, kind of floats on the
3431.61s - 3434.29s |  surface, um, and can pick up radio waves.
3434.29s - 3440.05s |  The only downside is any passing, uh, boats that run into the wire can chop
3440.05s - 3444.57s |  it up and pull it into their, uh, propellers, which can be a bit of a problem.
3445.57s - 3446.97s |  So yeah, expensive gadget.
3447.01s - 3447.29s |  Yeah.
3448.13s - 3451.29s |  No, actually it's surprisingly not that expensive to make.
3451.37s - 3455.85s |  Um, uh, there's also this very interesting research project that
3455.85s - 3459.69s |  actually uses saltwater to make an antenna.
3460.17s - 3464.25s |  Um, yeah, if you do search for saltwater antenna, you'll find
3464.25s - 3465.69s |  the project that's kind of crazy.
3466.17s - 3466.41s |  Yeah.
3466.45s - 3472.61s |  Um, Giglio, um, if, when you get your links put together, we're planning on
3472.61s - 3478.97s |  taking all the, um, uh, slides and stuff that are posted on this wall to my
3478.97s - 3482.73s |  left or to your right on that wall there.
3482.73s - 3487.41s |  And, uh, upload them on a webpage that people can go and download
3487.41s - 3489.57s |  those talks after the event is over.
3489.57s - 3491.29s |  So we can add your links to that too.
3491.73s - 3492.13s |  Perfect.
3492.33s - 3492.65s |  Perfect.
3495.08s - 3496.84s |  And I think we're great presentation.
3496.84s - 3497.24s |  Giglio.
3497.40s - 3497.80s |  Thank you.
3498.20s - 3498.64s |  It's awesome.
3498.64s - 3502.00s |  I'm going to stop sharing so I don't hijack the screen and
3502.36s - 3503.72s |  thanks for attending everybody.
3504.24s - 3504.52s |  Bye.
