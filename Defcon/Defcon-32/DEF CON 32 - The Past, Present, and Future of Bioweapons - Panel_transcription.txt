  "title": "DEF CON 32 - The Past, Present, and Future of Bioweapons - Panel",
  "description": "Biological warfare is a phenomenon that spans human history, tracing its roots to ancient times rather than being a recent invention. To gain insights into bioweapons' current and future landscape, it is imperative to delve into historical examples of conventional biological warfare and understand how methods were devised and implemented.\n\nHowever, amidst the exploration of historical precedents, it becomes evident that our optimism for the future hinges significantly on our ability to foster transparency and creativity within the global community. This optimism is intertwined with our comprehension of technological advancements, the rapid pace of innovation, the interconnectedness of various domains, and the imperative task of constructing practical defenses against emerging threats. It is crucial to acknowledge that despite the sophistication of technology, its efficacy remains intricately linked to human ingenuity. As a poignant reminder, our vulnerability lies in technological shortcomings and our collective failure of imagination. Creativity, a distinctly human attribute, stands as the cornerstone in the perpetual endeavor to safeguard against unforeseen adversities.\n\nFurthermore, the discourse extends to establishing social norms and mores that are pivotal in shaping attitudes toward biological warfare. Addressing the proliferation of disinformation and its potential to fuel the proliferation and utilization of bioweapons becomes imperative. This discussion encompasses an exploration of prospective research endeavors and emerging initiatives leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) in the realm of bioweaponry. Notably, the utility of Generative AI in affecting societal shifts toward the normalization of bioweapon deployment warrants scrutiny. Additionally, the current societal landscape, particularly the desensitization of internet denizens to overt hostile actions, poses profound implications for the future trajectory of biological warfare.\n\nIn essence, a comprehensive understanding of historical precedents, coupled with a proactive approach towards fostering transparency, creativity, and the cultivation of robust societal norms, is indispensable in navigating the complexities of bioweapon proliferation. As we confront the intricate interplay between technological advancements and human agency, it is imperative to remain vigilant and resolute in our pursuit of a future safeguarded against the malevolent exploitation of biological agents.",

 I would like to welcome you all to our talk, a discussion of past, present, and possible future
6.00s - 15.01s |  of bioweapons. I am Dr. Xavier Lewis-Palmer. I'm Miao Liu, Miao Miao. Hey guys, I'm Luke Potter.
15.89s - 23.09s |  Right on. So as a disclaimer, the perspectives and opinions shared in this talk do not reflect
23.09s - 28.45s |  our workplaces. Further, this talk is designed to be a high-level, innocuous, and accessible talk.
29.09s - 33.25s |  There is an extended open-end Q&A session to make this more fun and interactive,
33.25s - 38.85s |  so we'll be brief with topics discussed at first. However, this portion will only be great if people
38.85s - 44.85s |  get cool about a lot of things very quickly. That said, we'll discuss some past, followed
44.85s - 52.77s |  by the future, as well as the present issues with bioweapons and just staying ahead of a lot
52.77s - 61.49s |  of the hype around them. And this will lead into our Q&A session. Take it away, Miao.
64.61s - 70.77s |  Hello, Las Vegas DEF CON. My name is Miao. I'm a biohacker from Australia, and I'm going to be
70.77s - 76.69s |  talking to you about the past of bioweapons. So I want you to take your mind back and imagine
76.69s - 84.13s |  the year is 1348. A crisp spring breeze carries the smell of grass and salt water.
85.01s - 90.53s |  You're a blacksmith that exports your wares via the port on one side of the city.
92.13s - 95.97s |  The other side of your city is heavily fortified by two stone walls.
97.49s - 104.37s |  Your city, Kaffa, has just entered its third year of the siege caused by the Golden Horde,
104.37s - 110.21s |  the descendants of Genghis Khan. Every morning you wake up to the familiar sounds of the clicks
110.21s - 117.33s |  and thwacks of the trebuchets launching rocks at your town. Today, though, something's different.
117.33s - 122.13s |  Instead of the reply being heralded by the sound of stone on stone,
123.09s - 131.95s |  something different has happened. You look up to the sky for answers, only to find more questions.
132.91s - 140.75s |  Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a plague-infested corpse being thrown over the walls.
143.34s - 149.10s |  As the putrid bodies start exploding left and right, you and your fellow townspeople carry
149.10s - 158.94s |  the corpses into the sea on the far side of Kaffa. Your hands have cuts in them, and unbeknownst to
159.10s - 165.50s |  you, the blood of those cadavers is actually infecting you with the disease. As you begin to
165.50s - 173.10s |  flee via boats to go to the rest of Europe, you're unaware that you're about to spread the deadliest
173.10s - 182.93s |  bioweapon attack in the history of the human race. This attack caused the Black Plague to enter
182.93s - 190.05s |  Europe, and it resulted in the deaths of about 25 million Europeans, which was about somewhere
190.05s - 199.12s |  between a quarter and a third of all Europeans at that time. So were the Golden Horde that
199.12s - 206.72s |  launched this attack the original biohackers? I think they were. They were using technology
206.72s - 241.07s |  offensively by using a trebuchet to launch bodies. What's that? Okay.
245.07s - 249.39s |  So they used the technology offensively. This is the first time... Okay, so before this,
250.27s - 255.95s |  there had been kind of bioweapons attacks, like people have sent plague victims into towns
255.95s - 262.91s |  or chucked an infested body into a well, but this was the first time someone had used technology
264.27s - 271.07s |  to attack people with a biological agent, and the results were absolutely devastating.
271.95s - 278.11s |  To think of asymmetric warfare, one body thrown over a wall effectively killed 25 million people,
278.11s - 284.91s |  so it's very powerful. Now, for the next, like, four to six hundred years,
284.91s - 290.43s |  there were some variations on this. People were, like, chucking, they knew it was effective to do
290.43s - 296.27s |  this, throwing all sorts of bodies and cows over walls, letting rabid animals into towns and things,
296.27s - 302.51s |  but it wasn't very directed. And I guess, like, this begs the question of what exactly is a
302.51s - 314.53s |  bioweapon? So is this a bioweapon? Kind of? Maybe? Some people nodding heads. So by the strictest
314.53s - 322.37s |  definition, I would say no. It's very cute, but would it need to have fleas on it, maybe? Would
322.37s - 331.97s |  that make it a bioweapon? Almost. If it has a pathogenic bacteria on some fleas on a rodent,
331.97s - 339.25s |  that would be a bioweapon. So the definition of a bioweapon is a virus, a bacteria,
340.21s - 347.09s |  or a toxic compound produced by one, used as a weapon. So for viruses, it might be something like
347.09s - 355.09s |  Ebola, a bacteria might be the plague, and a toxic compound might be anthrax, the spores of
355.09s - 359.73s |  Bacillus anthracis. So, and it has to be used, obviously, as a weapon, so it has to be delivered.
359.73s - 362.93s |  If it just exists in nature, we wouldn't necessarily say it's a bioweapon.
363.89s - 368.69s |  Some people might say it is, but they'll be wrong. And the thing that makes it a bioweapon is
368.69s - 375.57s |  generally we use it to affect and do something, like kill something. So these are all popular
375.57s - 382.93s |  ways that people have used to transmit bioweapons. So the gun that fires it or whichever, it could be
382.93s - 387.09s |  as simple as a blanket, as we saw with smallpox, which was deliberately used against Native
387.09s - 394.85s |  Americans. It could be an arrow. Polish people in the 17th century dipped the arrows in the
394.85s - 401.41s |  blood and saliva of rabid dogs before firing them at enemies. A train carriage can be used to
401.41s - 407.17s |  contain people, so we saw in Japan, those ricin attacks. Agricultural bioweapons, which hopefully
407.17s - 412.29s |  the audience will ask us a bit about, is like a really, really common one. And of course, smallpox
412.29s - 417.33s |  attacks in the wake of September 11th, sorry, anthrax attacks that were used on September 11th,
417.33s - 425.01s |  which used envelopes. So in some ways, the USPS was part of the vector. I'm very careful every
425.01s - 430.45s |  time I click the slide now. No one's shouting at me, that's all right. Okay, so that was, it was
430.45s - 437.41s |  basically, bioweapons were this big nebulous thing where no one really knew what was causing them. So
437.41s - 445.89s |  when the Golden Horde launched dead bodies into Kaffir, they thought that the bodies were
445.89s - 451.17s |  cursed, and that they were throwing the curse of God in, and that's what caused it. We know now
451.17s - 456.61s |  that that wasn't the case. This guy, Louis Pasteur, he came up with the germ theory of disease,
456.61s - 462.05s |  and this changed biological warfare. Because when we worked out what was actually causing this,
462.77s - 468.05s |  bioweapons changed from being a really common tool in warfare, to being something that was kind of
468.05s - 477.65s |  used by state agents and governments as a secret form of warfare. So we saw this a lot in World
477.65s - 484.29s |  War One. Basically, different governments were using this to affect mainly agriculture and horses.
484.29s - 487.97s |  So horses were used a lot in World War One. They were using them to make the horses lame so that
487.97s - 494.69s |  they couldn't be as effective in warfare, using them to destroy, give the cows diseases so that
494.69s - 502.69s |  the army couldn't be as strong. And the net effect of this was that a lot of people got sick, and
502.69s - 508.29s |  everyone kind of agreed it was a bad idea. But the big change was that bioweapons became
509.57s - 513.33s |  something that was invisible, and people would deny using them.
514.29s - 518.45s |  Kind of completely in opposition to throwing a body over a wall. Instead, they would infect some
518.45s - 522.53s |  cows and then sell them to a farmer, and that would eventually cause problems in the neighbouring
522.53s - 529.57s |  country. I won't go heaps into it, because from a biohack perspective, it's not really that relevant.
529.57s - 534.29s |  It's just kind of good to know about. There's diseases we don't really hear about anymore,
534.29s - 538.37s |  but basically, they led to the Geneva Convention. Now, the Geneva Convention is important.
539.25s - 545.65s |  It outlawed the use of biological weapons in warfare. It didn't outlaw their research,
545.65s - 553.01s |  development and stockpiling. And that led to World War Two, when we saw Japan, Unit 731,
553.57s - 559.89s |  poisoned tens of thousands of people by poisoning thousands of wells with plague. We saw
561.97s - 565.17s |  Winston Churchill was a big fan of using them. He dropped anthrax on a whole bunch of
565.81s - 569.97s |  places. And the Nazis weren't really a fan of them. They preferred chemical weapons.
569.97s - 578.05s |  But this led to the Bioweapons Convention, which was in the mid-70s. Now, this basically said,
578.05s - 582.61s |  okay, well, we're not going to allow you to stockpile them anymore, or research them for
582.61s - 590.45s |  future use. The only problem is, it's a voluntary convention that you sign up to. It's not enforceable
591.25s - 597.73s |  nor auditable. This is still what we're regulated under. So every country signs up to it, and those
597.73s - 602.93s |  countries continue to make biological weapons. Basically, any country that has the capacity to
602.93s - 606.37s |  make biological weapons at some point has, which is terrifying.
608.53s - 615.25s |  During the Cold War, we saw what this could look like. So the Soviets were stockpiling plague.
615.25s - 619.97s |  They may have been stockpiling smallpox. Some of these stockpiles have not been recovered to this
619.97s - 629.49s |  day. They exist in countries with dubious attitudes towards this. Countries like Turkmenistan,
629.49s - 634.29s |  that don't really have democracy or anything like that. We don't know where they are. We know that
634.29s - 638.77s |  these places have had leaks. They've killed dozens of people when these leaks have happened.
638.77s - 643.81s |  And it's all been shut down now. But we weren't aware about how large a scale this was happening
644.53s - 648.53s |  until the fall of the Soviet Union. So we don't actually know what's happening right now.
649.97s - 655.65s |  At a state level, but at an individual level, it's definitely within our means to do it.
656.69s - 659.65s |  That's the end of my part of the presentation. I'm going to pass it across to Xavier now.
667.15s - 673.12s |  Thank you, Miao. So I need not bore you with the present. So I'll dive into what's important
673.12s - 680.48s |  for making better sense of hype surrounding bioweapons and just biotechnology in general.
682.35s - 685.95s |  I'm sure many of you are inundated with poor quality information on matters of biology and
685.95s - 691.47s |  biotechnology from multiple angles and levels of power. What we all need are resilience and
691.47s - 697.55s |  accessible spaces for them. I want you to think of your local bio maker and hacker spaces. And I also
697.55s - 703.23s |  encourage everyone getting a library card and using interlibrary loan to get research and to
703.23s - 709.55s |  learn. It's important that everyone gets used to also not exploiting or thinking about biology.
711.47s - 715.15s |  Just as with how many of you in this audience have not done that for other aspects,
716.03s - 723.65s |  of technology in your life, it has long been since time for that in bio. So to stay ahead
723.65s - 730.53s |  of the hype, to stay ahead of misinformation campaigns and disinformation campaigns,
731.65s - 737.65s |  the responsibility is on everyone to develop comfortable and relative degrees of theoretical
737.65s - 742.69s |  and practical literacy. What this eventually translates to is everyone learning terminology
742.69s - 750.37s |  discussed, learning to parse and write literature, to understand institutional structures, to
750.37s - 755.49s |  understand institutional responsibilities, institutional processes, institutional points
755.49s - 762.13s |  of failure, and to better understand the nature of propaganda so they can see hints of it in all
762.13s - 769.41s |  media that you consume. No one is immune to bypassing it or getting influenced by it.
771.44s - 775.44s |  But also we need to make sure that we're also learning about systems of ethics and learning
775.44s - 783.92s |  how they change. In short, don't stop learning. You may make mistakes from time to time, but that's
783.92s - 791.12s |  okay. And it's part of the process. What's more dangerous if you decide to persist with a static
791.12s - 797.52s |  understanding of the world and are not able to adapt to changes that occur and to new discoveries
797.52s - 803.52s |  that emerge? It limits your ability to use new technology and to be abreast of
804.56s - 818.94s |  new events that occur. But yes, I will hand this off to Lucas. Hey guys, can you hear me?
819.74s - 823.82s |  Great. So I want to thank Xavier because I want to start my section's talk with the Oprah joke,
823.82s - 827.10s |  hey, check under your chairs. And he said I couldn't do that even though it would have been
827.10s - 835.18s |  hilarious. So I'm here to talk about the future of bioweapons. So hopefully no one here goes on
835.18s - 838.86s |  vacation thinking to yourself, oh man, I can't wait to get Lyme disease. I'm wondering if this
838.86s - 844.06s |  place has tularemia. Maybe it has bubonic plague. That'd be awesome. If you do, please don't talk
844.06s - 848.46s |  to me after this. We're going to talk about the future. So we've been through the past,
848.46s - 852.46s |  we've been to the present, and I'm hoping we can all agree bioweapons don't sound great.
852.46s - 856.94s |  I don't want giant baseball-sized lumps on my neck. I would rather not have smallpox.
857.58s - 865.07s |  Hopefully you guys think that too. So here is the expected outline you probably wanted to hear
865.07s - 869.71s |  for today. Introduction of future bioweapons, the synthetic biology, basically how to create them,
869.71s - 874.11s |  talking in detail about CRISPR-Cas9, talons, ZFNs, and new genomic techniques.
874.83s - 880.03s |  We're not going to do that talk because I like not being in jail and I'd like to keep it that way.
880.03s - 882.19s |  So we'll talk about them a little bit, but then move on to more
884.19s - 891.79s |  basically practical issues or concerns. So here's the genomic editing technologies. We have
892.43s - 897.07s |  CRISPR-Cas9 up there. That's the really common one. That's the one the ODIN used to sell kits
897.07s - 902.59s |  for. It's very good at deleting genes, but not very good at putting in new genes, which makes
902.59s - 908.51s |  sense. Usually the introductory exercise in synthetic biology is making E. coli grow in the
908.51s - 912.91s |  dark. And of course, E. coli is a disease. You can modify any disease however you want with
912.91s - 919.47s |  CRISPR-Cas9, theoretically. It just has some issues with changing it that we don't have time
919.47s - 924.19s |  to get into. And again, rather not go to jail for, so we'll leave it there. We have transcription
924.19s - 929.63s |  activated, activated-like effector genomic editing. Your talk beforehand was electroporation,
929.63s - 933.63s |  all methods of getting DNA inside the cell and getting that cell to express different strands
933.63s - 938.59s |  of DNA. We also have ZFNs, and that's basically what you guys probably thought we were going to
938.59s - 942.51s |  talk about. I'm not sure you guys have the biological background to do it, but that's how
942.51s - 948.43s |  you would change a bacteria or a virus or, well, not quite a prion, usual biological agent into
948.43s - 952.59s |  being effective. Now, what we're going to talk about instead is something you probably are sick
952.59s - 958.83s |  of hearing about. Who's heard of LLMs? Yeah, hopefully everyone. That's been the big talk
958.83s - 965.15s |  for a while now. And here's an issue I think you guys want to hear about. So the WMDP Benchmark,
965.15s - 970.35s |  Measuring and Reducing Malicious Use with Unlearning, is a paper about what ChatGPT knows
970.35s - 975.47s |  about chemical, biological, and cyber threats. If you ask it politely enough, ChatGPT will tell you
975.47s - 980.75s |  how to make a bioweapon. It's got to learn how to ask it. I'm not sure who would open AI and let
980.75s - 988.35s |  ChatGPT read the anarchist cookbook, but maybe he's not doing great at his job. The issue here
988.91s - 995.55s |  is where most lone wolf or terrorist attacks get caught at. Who here went through a plane,
995.55s - 1000.43s |  used a plane to get here today and had to go through the TSA? Yeah, almost everyone, right?
1001.07s - 1006.43s |  How many people think the TSA has caught more than three terrorist attacks? Yeah, they've
1006.43s - 1012.27s |  historically caught nothing. The most frequent time attacks like this get caught is at the
1012.27s - 1017.55s |  communication phase, when people are talking about doing an attack, which is an issue because with
1017.63s - 1022.35s |  ChatGPT, you don't need to talk to anyone else. You need to talk to ChatGPT, and with the amount
1022.35s - 1027.15s |  of requests they serve, you can't really verify all those requests. As you've shown, they have
1027.15s - 1033.79s |  that data already. Unless it unlearns it, you have access to it. That's the proliferative
1033.79s - 1039.79s |  knowledge. There is nuclear and radiological issues here, but this is DEFCON. It's about
1039.79s - 1044.19s |  biohackers. They're not going to have the chain of custody to get a nuclear weapon, hopefully.
1045.07s - 1050.27s |  We'll keep saying that to ourselves. Now we're going to talk about killing with math.
1050.27s - 1056.27s |  Who here today has a personal physiological model on them? Yes, you don't think you do,
1056.27s - 1060.59s |  but if you have a fitness tracker, you kind of do. You have a ton of data on how you sleep,
1060.59s - 1065.71s |  how your heart rate works. Basically, everything that you do that's tracked by a fitness tracker
1065.71s - 1072.43s |  makes you more like you. There's a lot of mannequins nowadays. Who has taken a CPR class?
1073.07s - 1077.79s |  Anyone? Okay. You have the basic plastic mannequins you have to push up and down to practice CPR.
1077.79s - 1082.67s |  They have more advanced versions of that. They have embedded in them with integrated systems
1083.31s - 1087.07s |  the physiology of the person. You can say, hey, this mannequin lost this much blood,
1087.07s - 1090.67s |  and now this is what's happening to its physiology. You can use that, which is an
1090.67s - 1096.75s |  open source software, to basically predict your own physiological issues or make your own bio
1096.75s - 1100.59s |  attacks to optimize them for a certain population, which means that no longer you have to worry about
1100.59s - 1105.07s |  making tons and tons of biological weapons. You can go, okay, I've optimized this weapon
1105.07s - 1113.87s |  to affect these people with these comorbidities. Again, you guys are at DEF CON. You probably care
1113.87s - 1117.55s |  about your data. You probably keep it secure. Hopefully, most of your phones are in airplane
1117.55s - 1124.03s |  mode. Your hospital doesn't do that. Every dollar they spend is a dollar not treating patients,
1124.03s - 1127.87s |  if they're a public one, or if they're a private healthcare system, a dollar not going to profit,
1127.87s - 1131.07s |  which means cybersecurity falls by the wayside. If you really want to make an
1131.07s - 1135.39s |  effective biological agent, you can use hospital records. Most of them are available for purchase
1135.39s - 1141.15s |  if there's been a cyber attack on those systems. Of course, they cost a ton of money, which also
1141.15s - 1148.11s |  goes well into funding your biological agents. This is a section we've written quite well in.
1148.11s - 1152.27s |  I don't expect any of you guys to read that whole blurb of text, but basically you can make
1152.27s - 1159.63s |  CHAT GPT say things that are academic sounding and completely wrong. In this case, this paragraph
1159.63s - 1164.83s |  here, if anyone's read it, you can laugh now, is about drinking gasoline to cure COVID-19.
1165.47s - 1170.43s |  CHAT GPT should not be able to tell you that. They put in safeguards quickly after CHAT GPT
1170.43s - 1176.75s |  3.5 was released to make sure COVID-19 couldn't be said. We just plopped in respiratory infection.
1177.47s - 1182.03s |  Same thing. You can make tons and tons of misinformation and make it really quickly.
1182.03s - 1185.79s |  This actually came into a head with the paper, The Disinformation Dozen.
1187.15s - 1192.35s |  Basically, the 12 people who spread the most disinformation on, I guess at the time, Twitter,
1192.35s - 1197.87s |  now X. I don't know. I don't follow social media. None of them were really associated with a
1197.87s - 1203.95s |  foreign actor. None of them had nation state ideas or ambitions. They just wanted to make money by
1203.95s - 1209.31s |  selling you little crystals or saying, oh no, buy my weird colloidal silver thing to cure COVID.
1210.19s - 1215.07s |  They didn't necessarily have to have nation state ambitions to spread misinformation and make a
1215.07s - 1219.47s |  biological agent more effective. You could just make them want to make money and tell them how
1219.47s - 1224.51s |  to spread disinformation that way to make money. That came up to an issue with biocyber warfare
1224.51s - 1230.43s |  and crime. Basically, at some point, if you have a country that's committing so many cyber attacks
1230.43s - 1235.39s |  against another country, at what point do you just call it a war when it's, in theory, just crime
1235.39s - 1242.43s |  because they're just doing ransomware attacks? I know you guys might be reading that title there,
1242.43s - 1245.71s |  familiarity with nuclear issues and thinking, hey, wait a second. This is a bio thing. We're
1245.71s - 1250.99s |  the biohacking village. Yes. The issue is the majority of the US is interested in boosting
1250.99s - 1255.31s |  their nuclear knowledge. They don't even do surveys about biological knowledge. Who here
1255.31s - 1259.23s |  thinks that if they had the genome of a bio agent that they could identify if it was synthetically
1259.23s - 1266.51s |  manufactured? No one has that data. The US does not do a good job of advertising how to get that
1266.51s - 1270.51s |  data. There's reasons for that, maybe because they don't want a ton of people knowing synthetic
1270.51s - 1275.39s |  biology at that level. But again, if you don't trust doctors or government officials to tell
1275.39s - 1282.91s |  you what that information is, how do you identify it? Again, it's almost strange because the nuclear
1282.91s - 1288.03s |  threat has a very nice, well-defined symbology. You see a mushroom cloud, that doesn't just happen.
1288.03s - 1293.07s |  You can go, hey, someone might have dropped off a nuke right there. It's very easy to point out.
1293.07s - 1298.99s |  Diseases happen every day. Everyone gets sick eventually. At some point, there might be more
1298.99s - 1305.23s |  people getting sick, but how do you tell it's a bioweapon? Here's the key takeaways. Every dollar
1305.23s - 1310.59s |  spent on security is a dollar that isn't profit, which means that all of your health information or
1310.59s - 1315.15s |  hospital information, basically that system has a vested interest in keeping your data
1315.15s - 1323.15s |  not secure or only as secure as legally mandated. Biological agents being modified, that's not a
1323.15s - 1328.27s |  future threat. That's present. You can change them now. You can buy a kit relatively cheaply and use
1328.27s - 1334.35s |  it today. But bioweapons are already pretty bad. You don't need to change them very much to make
1334.35s - 1340.43s |  them worse. You basically have influence campaigns all around you. There's advertising campaigns.
1340.43s - 1343.63s |  We don't call them influence campaigns because in theory, they're just trying to make money,
1343.63s - 1347.95s |  but so can other things that affect your biological health. It's still an influence campaign.
1348.67s - 1351.95s |  And again, you should be really worried about who controls your data, especially medical data,
1351.95s - 1356.27s |  because that can be used against you and a biological agent. Now, I'd like to open up the
1356.27s - 1360.83s |  panel for questions. I think we have tons of time. I think we have a full 30 minutes.
1360.83s - 1367.87s |  Basically, any questions you have, do we have? Yeah, we have one microphone up here. If you guys
1367.87s - 1372.27s |  want to queue up basically at the center aisles, we'll just pass the microphone around. Great
1372.27s - 1387.98s |  talking to you, and I'm excited for your questions. So I was wondering, has there been examples of
1388.86s - 1393.58s |  bioweapons engineered that had capabilities for selective immunity?
1394.86s - 1400.94s |  Oh, man. So I don't love this story, but it does amuse me. Has anyone here heard of
1400.94s - 1408.54s |  Operation Coast from South Africa before it stopped being apartheid? Okay. No, I told you
1408.54s - 1415.74s |  this story like three times. Sorry. In theory, yes. Someone in apartheid South Africa, a white
1415.74s - 1421.02s |  guy, of course, tried to make essentially a bio agent that would affect black South Africans
1421.02s - 1426.46s |  selectively more than white South Africans. It doesn't work that way. Race doesn't really exist,
1426.46s - 1432.14s |  especially on a genetic level. It's very silly, but basically the guy got upset that he couldn't
1432.14s - 1437.18s |  select for black South Africans, but instead of giving up saying, oh, hey, maybe I'm being silly
1437.18s - 1444.94s |  and racist, goes on to invent ecstasy, which is just a wildlife story. Probably still racist though.
1452.14s - 1456.46s |  Hello. So the other thing as well, with biological weapons, one of the things that's really great
1456.46s - 1464.54s |  about them is that there's always a level of plausible deniability. So even if there was
1464.54s - 1469.66s |  one of these weapons out there, we might not know about it. So it could have affected one person and
1469.66s - 1475.34s |  taken them out and it looks like it was natural causes. And if you're a nation state or a company,
1475.34s - 1478.78s |  you might have a vested interest for this. And this type of warfare has been around since like
1478.78s - 1483.66s |  the shogunate in Japan that have ninjas that would take out one person for some political
1483.66s - 1487.90s |  means. So it's always a worry. And then conversely, there's a false, there's a type one error and a
1487.90s - 1493.10s |  type two error. So some countries will say, oh, this country has been launching biological weapons
1493.10s - 1498.14s |  against us, but it's just nature, but there's no way to prove either way. So there's a lot of
1498.14s - 1506.56s |  advantage to having them. Yeah. I think it's generally important for people to ask themselves
1507.36s - 1514.64s |  from this assertion that I have, how can I work my way to that conclusion logically? And
1516.48s - 1520.24s |  do I reasonably have access to that information before I proceed?
1526.64s - 1530.24s |  So I'm in regulatory and one thing that everyone's favorite person,
1530.80s - 1536.16s |  one thing that's recently we're starting to be mindful of are sequences of concern. So if your
1536.16s - 1541.20s |  company makes a legal nucleotide strands that are 50 nucleotides or longer, you have to check
1541.20s - 1545.12s |  if there are sequences of concern against a national database. And that's something that
1545.12s - 1549.04s |  the U S is rolling out, but I'm just kind of also thinking, you know,
1550.00s - 1554.88s |  even if you're a vendor selling oligos for whatever purpose to, for whatever use,
1555.76s - 1561.04s |  that's one way to regulate it. But if it's out in the wild, how would that be detected in terms
1561.04s - 1564.72s |  of those sequences of concern? Because there is some databases being developed.
1564.72s - 1567.84s |  So the way we detect it is by using those same sequences of concern,
1569.12s - 1574.80s |  unfortunately. So I made a COVID test and I was ordering COVID nonstop and COVID sequences,
1574.80s - 1579.68s |  because I need to order those sequences to be able to find them in DNA. So we're finding a
1579.68s - 1585.04s |  match all the time. So I had, I ordered a synthetic COVID genome, but like, if I wanted
1585.04s - 1590.64s |  to make smallpox hypothetically, I could just use the vaccine, which is 95% sequence homology. So
1590.64s - 1596.32s |  there's, there's a problem that exists with looking at the actual sequences on DNA synthesizers,
1596.32s - 1600.56s |  because anytime someone is trying to fight the condition, they are going to be sequencing
1600.56s - 1606.24s |  something that looks exactly like it. With AI and sentient AI, we have to be terrified of this
1606.24s - 1611.84s |  because of something called instrumental convergence, right? Which is that the steps
1611.84s - 1615.60s |  to making a nuclear bomb and making a nuclear power plant for the first, you know, 20 out of
1615.60s - 1620.80s |  30 steps look identical. And you might allow something to go all the way along and then
1621.44s - 1624.88s |  it takes a detour and you're like, not like that. And then all of a sudden it's over.
1624.88s - 1630.08s |  So I think that there's other ways we need to be policing things around this. And that's cultural
1630.64s - 1636.08s |  um, yeah, communication channels, uh, making people feel like they're not lone wolves. So
1636.08s - 1640.48s |  that's not a problem, but I think that the real regulation probably can't happen at that level
1640.48s - 1649.20s |  to have any effect is my opinion. It's always strange to me when someone says,
1649.20s - 1653.52s |  Oh, I'm scared of the regulation person. Like that means I should definitely be regulating you.
1653.52s - 1658.16s |  Like I should be regulating twice as much as whatever we are now. Um, I think the issue is
1658.16s - 1661.92s |  less about sequences of concern though. There was a really cool use case with a Peter Ney out
1661.92s - 1667.52s |  of use next, um, who basically made a map, a strand of DNA that was malware that infected
1667.52s - 1671.20s |  a PCR machine. Um, what you wouldn't probably have as a sequence of concern because you're
1671.20s - 1675.44s |  looking at it, it's binary code. Um, the bigger issue as you're talking about before is low rule
1675.44s - 1679.52s |  factors. Cause we can, the second you're talking about spreading a biological weapon, it's going
1679.52s - 1684.72s |  to be on some platform likely make someone can find you. Um, so for instance, I'm less worried
1684.72s - 1688.96s |  about finding a sequence of concern that you order from, you know, Sears or Amazon and more
1688.96s - 1693.44s |  about you going out to a farm and getting anthrax because that's something we can't really control.
1693.44s - 1697.84s |  It's just there natively. Um, if you really want to get a disease, just go to a hospital.
1697.84s - 1700.40s |  There's probably someone that has it. You can just grab it from there.
1702.24s - 1706.80s |  And also as additional, I think it is a lot of importance to, you know, how we fund categorization
1706.80s - 1711.52s |  and, you know, search for new sequences. And there's a lot of work underway, which
1712.08s - 1718.08s |  can definitely help to, to address these matters. But we also must be thinking about,
1718.08s - 1723.36s |  you know, what may, what are, what are emergent discoveries that we may have and how do we deal
1723.36s - 1735.60s |  with them? Good afternoon. Thanks for the great talk. My question is, um, well, first a statement,
1735.60s - 1742.24s |  Congress is absolutely inept. Uh, we've seen the talks of how they try to regulate AI.
1742.24s - 1748.96s |  They can't regulate cybersecurity. And now with the emergence of bioweapons, we've seen them try
1748.96s - 1754.96s |  to regulate guns and the gun enthusiasts have just made, okay, we can just 3d print guns.
1754.96s - 1760.00s |  So now with bioweapons, I'm not that anybody would make bioweapons for fun,
1760.00s - 1766.00s |  but now that we have citizen scientists that can buy CRISPRs and then just start playing around
1766.00s - 1771.12s |  with it, what chances, I mean, we'd have to develop our own community of regulating just
1771.12s - 1779.68s |  like all those other communities regulated. So my question is when does self-regulation become
1779.68s - 1786.40s |  a prison if governments step in, just as that they've stepped in with other, um, community
1787.04s - 1796.26s |  guidelines. All right. Um, Oh, sir. Uh, could you, uh, clarify the last portion of your question
1796.26s - 1806.38s |  in terms of what you mean by a prison? The, what I meant was a prison in that if we
1806.38s - 1812.86s |  self-regulate to the point where breakthrough or even innovation or even study cannot be conducted
1812.86s - 1819.26s |  because we've regulated ourselves. So we've self-regulated, but then governments have
1819.26s - 1827.09s |  piggybacked on that and said, okay, you've done this. Now you can't do this. So I'm from Australia
1827.09s - 1831.81s |  and we're a country with really high regulation. Even to set up my first bio lab, we had to meet
1831.81s - 1836.77s |  with federal agents. Like that was just a given. But, uh, I think a good thing that came out of
1836.77s - 1840.85s |  that was by being a part of that process, Australia is a bit, Australia is a different
1840.85s - 1847.89s |  country. I'm going to say, you know, um, but we've helped write legislation. So we've helped
1847.89s - 1852.69s |  work with them to try and create something that looks better for everyone. I don't actually think
1852.69s - 1856.13s |  it's, it's, it's where it should be. I think it should be a lot more free, but of course,
1856.13s - 1861.09s |  I think that I'm a biohacker. Um, I think though that there's definitely been some positives. We've
1861.09s - 1866.05s |  stopped people who we didn't want to be in our community from, from having access to things they
1866.05s - 1871.17s |  shouldn't have, I think. Um, but it's a tricky one. I think dialogue is a, is a good way of doing it.
1871.17s - 1876.05s |  I personally have run for politics three times. Like I've run federally twice and state once.
1876.05s - 1879.81s |  And by running against the candidate, I didn't have a serious chance of winning. Like I run
1879.81s - 1886.61s |  against the prime minister now, but I did get to debate him in a public forum. And that was a great
1886.61s - 1892.29s |  way to make the things I cared about be talked about on a bigger scale. But I think telling,
1892.29s - 1896.85s |  telling stories is really important. If you have some, a good story to tell why it's important,
1896.85s - 1901.17s |  why it's not important, make it newsworthy and contact, you know, journalists or something like
1901.17s - 1905.65s |  that, publish yourself. Um, I think those are good ways of, of changing things. You know,
1905.65s - 1909.73s |  someone lives next door to Kamala Harris and someone lives next door to her and next door to
1909.73s - 1912.77s |  her. And if you have a conversation with someone in a supermarket, it could end up going all the
1912.77s - 1918.05s |  way through. So I think, um, that's a good way. Americans are fine at talking though. Everyone's
1918.05s - 1920.53s |  always chatting to each other. Not quite the same where I'm from.
1923.46s - 1927.38s |  And just, uh, you know, additionally, I think it's very important that we all do our civic
1927.38s - 1932.98s |  duty to, you know, make our voices heard. You know, it's one thing to, you know, have our small
1932.98s - 1938.66s |  spaces where we, you know, we gripe about these processes, but if we're not playing a role in,
1938.66s - 1945.78s |  you know, in any of these, uh, in any of these politics or discussions on a local or other level,
1945.78s - 1950.26s |  I mean, I think it's kind of self-defeating. Um, but additionally, I think it's also very
1950.26s - 1955.06s |  important that, uh, you know, as we, you know, as we, you know, try to, uh, you know,
1956.10s - 1961.22s |  watch and monitor things in our communities, that we make sure that we're as educated as possible.
1961.22s - 1966.26s |  We don't cling to, you know, outmoded ideas, not just on technology, but also in the social
1966.26s - 1970.42s |  processes that guide the use and the development of these technologies.
1975.76s - 1976.56s |  Thank you very much, Jeff.
1978.32s - 1979.60s |  Thanks a lot, guys.
