**Introduction**
- Speaker: Ricky Lawshae, also known as Headless Zeke
- Role: Principal security researcher at Keysight Technologies
- Location: Austin, Texas
- Focus: Security and offensive IoT research
- Experience: Speaking at DEF CON and other conferences

**Microhard Overview**
- Canadian-based company
- Specializes in long-range "robust" radio equipment
- Used in SCADA environments, point-of-sale terminals, power utilities, unmanned vehicles
- Claims involvement in remote device access

**Bullet LTE-NA2 Device**
- Purpose: Adds cellular connectivity to serial and Ethernet devices
- Features: 32-bit ARM Cortex A5 processor, 128 MB Spansion flash firmware chip, 256 MB RAM, QuekTel modem, SIM card slot, POE, Ethernet, USB, serial ports, programmable IO ports

**Security Issues**
- **Firmware Vulnerabilities**:
  - Unsigned and unencrypted firmware updates
  - Easy to forge and extract using binwalk
  - Contains boot loader, Linux kernel, SquashFS file system

- **Web Management Portal**:
  - Based on UHC2PD from OpenWRT 2014
  - Configurable from LAN and WAN by default
  - Shell scripts with multiple post-auth command injections
  - Ping function vulnerable to command injection

- **Authentication Protocol**:
  - Uses basic auth (base64 encoded user:pass)
  - Improper handling of logouts leading to buffer overflow

**Discovery Protocol**
- Listens for broadcast UDP messages on specific ports for device types (3G, IP-based, LTE)
- Discovery responses include MAC address, IP address, host name, SSID, model name, firmware version, network management software (NMS)

**Exploitation**
- **Post-Auth Command Injection**:
  - Requires valid username and password
  - Demonstrated using diagnostics page

- **Pre-Auth Exploit**:
  - Exploits authentication protocol
  - ARM ROP exploit discussed

**Release Notes and Fixes**
- Vague release notes criticized for minimizing impact
- Fixes included switching from UHC2PD to lightTPD, more input sanitization
- Persistent issues due to reliance on shell scripts

**Conclusion**
- Emphasis on the need for a robust secure development process
