**Introduction and Background**
- **Presentation Title:** DEF CON 32 - Signature-Based Detection Using Network Timing
- **Speaker:** Josh Pyorre
- **Affiliation:** Cisco Talos; previously worked with Zscaler, Umbrella, OpenDNS, NASA, and Mandiant
- **Focus:** Attribution and infection chain in security research
- **Example Threats:** Emotet, Epoch 4

**Attribution Techniques**
- **Tools Used:** VirusTotal, URL tracking
- **Process:** Finding domains/URLs, hash tracking, gathering more attribution
- **Frameworks:** Minor attack framework to attribute tools, tactics, and procedures
- **Interest Levels:** Government threat actors, campaigns, malware types

**Infection Chain**
- **Common Patterns:** Email links/attachments leading to OfficeDoc with macros
- **Examples:** Emotet, QuackBot
- **Detection Challenges:** SSL traffic complicates detection

**Detection Methods**
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Use of IDS rules for malware detection
- **Yara Rules:** Typically for binary analysis, adaptable for network traffic
- **Tools:** Yara PCAP for network traffic analysis

**Network Traffic Challenges**
- **Visibility Issues:** SSL encryption limits detection
- **Typical Network Behavior:** Understanding normal vs. malicious patterns
- **Packet Capture (PCAP):** Importance of analyzing PCAP files for detection

**Pattern Recognition and Analysis**
- **Methodologies:** Averages, Levenstein distance, co-integration
- **Challenges:** Identifying patterns within network traffic
- **Comparative Analysis:** Benign vs. malicious traffic analysis

**Signature Development**
- **Process:** Creating signatures from network traffic patterns
- **Tools:** Levenstein distance, fuzziness in detection
- **Application:** Use of PCAP files to generate detection signatures

**Future Work and Practical Applications**
- **Production Use:** Integrating detection methods into operational environments
- **API Development:** Enhancing functionality with third-party integrations
- **Creative Exploration:** Using audio as an alternative analysis method
