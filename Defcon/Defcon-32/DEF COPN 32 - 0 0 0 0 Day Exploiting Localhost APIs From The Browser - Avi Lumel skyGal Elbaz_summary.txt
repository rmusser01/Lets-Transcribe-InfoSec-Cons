**Introduction to Zero-Day Vulnerability**

- **Zero-Day Vulnerability**: An undisclosed flaw in browsers allowing remote network attacks through localhost.
- **Presenters**: Gal, co-founder and CTO of Oligo Security, and Avi, security researcher.
- **Objective**: Disclose technical details of the vulnerability and demonstrate its exploitation.

**Port Scanning and Private Network Access**

- **Port Scanning**: Concept of identifying open ports, a recurring issue over 18 years.
- **Private Network Access (PNA)**: Aims to solve browser communication with localhost, defining public, private, and local networks.

**Historical Context and Standardization Challenges**

- **Lack of Standardization**: No standards 18 years ago, allowing HTTP requests to local networks.
- **Drive-by Pharming**: Early exploit targeting home routers via HTTP requests.

**Browser Responses and Standards Development**

- **Browser Initiatives**: Google and Firefox working on PNA, but standardization is still in progress.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Defines web behavior, influenced PNA development.

**Exploitation Techniques and Demonstration**

- **Exploitation**: Using 0.0.0.0 to bypass restrictions and access localhost services.
- **Shadow Ray**: Attack on AI workloads using a zero-day vulnerability in Ray, a Kubernetes-like platform for AI.

**Mitigation and Browser Updates**

- **Browser Mitigations**: Safari, Chrome, and Firefox implementing changes to block 0.0.0.0 exploits.
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Coordinated with browsers to prevent zero-day exploitation.

**Conclusion and Recommendations**

- **Awareness**: Highlighting ongoing vulnerabilities and need for new security measures.
- **Call to Action**: Encouraging community involvement in developing and adhering to standards.
