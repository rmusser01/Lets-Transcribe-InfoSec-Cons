  "title": "DEF CON 32 - Pick Your Poison: Navigating a secure clean energy transition - Emma Stewart",
  "description": "Clean Energy technology, while essential for the energy transition, often utilizes components sourced from adversarial countries, potentially increasing cyber vulnerabilities, especially in systems managed by smaller utilities with limited cybersecurity expertise. The previous approaches of 'rip and replace' to eliminate foreign components have proved inadequate and if applied to clean energy, may be economically and technically destabilizing.\n\nThis policy session will also delve into the broader implications of a digitalized supply chain, where simplistic views of cybersecurity do not suffice. Instead, a nuanced understanding of the operational and physical realities of energy systems is essential. By discussing how to balance immediate economic pressures against long-term sustainability and security, the session aims to foster a more informed and effective policy discourse.\n\nIn summary, as the energy sector evolves to include diverse infrastructure systems\u2014ranging from hospitals to military installations\u2014the need for a robust, informed, and agile policy approach to cybersecurity becomes increasingly critical. This session will provide a platform for critical discourse to ensure that the transition to renewable energy is both secure and sustainable, aligning climate goals with national security imperatives",

 Hi everybody, thanks for joining me today.
2.24s - 4.12s |  Oh, that was loud, I'm sorry.
4.12s - 5.52s |  Thanks for joining me today.
6.52s - 7.44s |  My name's Emma Stewart.
7.44s - 9.28s |  I'm a Chief Power Grid Scientist
9.28s - 11.48s |  at Idaho National Laboratory.
11.48s - 13.36s |  I've spent about the last 20 years
13.36s - 16.76s |  working on power grid narrowed stuff effectively.
16.76s - 19.44s |  I've done everything from essentially
19.44s - 23.32s |  working on poles and wires about 20 something years ago
23.32s - 26.20s |  up to now where I like to be called Doctor
26.20s - 29.84s |  and it's kind of cool, but I do all sorts of things.
29.84s - 33.00s |  I've worked as a Chief Scientist for 900 utilities.
33.00s - 37.64s |  I built a cyber program for all of the small
37.64s - 40.40s |  rural co-ops in the country.
40.40s - 42.40s |  But the last few years I've been working
42.40s - 43.76s |  mostly on renewable security
43.76s - 45.68s |  and that's what I'm gonna talk about today.
45.68s - 48.80s |  So just very briefly, I'll start here.
48.80s - 52.04s |  We are in the middle of various different crises.
52.04s - 54.72s |  Essentially the climate has been changing
54.72s - 56.76s |  and in the last few years we've had,
56.76s - 59.72s |  I believe a number of now $10 billion weather
60.60s - 61.64s |  events that are causing all sorts of havoc
61.64s - 64.56s |  around the country, especially in our power grid
64.56s - 66.76s |  in particular because things fall down in weather.
66.76s - 68.52s |  As much as everyone wants to think cyber
68.52s - 69.96s |  is probably the worst problem we have,
69.96s - 71.32s |  it's not, it's weather.
71.32s - 74.60s |  It knocks things down far more often than any of you do.
74.60s - 78.96s |  So yeah, that's the world.
78.96s - 80.60s |  But this isn't great.
80.60s - 82.08s |  We do need to change this.
82.08s - 84.28s |  The energy sector essentially provides
84.28s - 88.20s |  about 28% of emissions into our atmosphere.
88.24s - 90.04s |  That's helping with this climate change problem.
90.04s - 91.88s |  So we're trying to change that by installing
91.88s - 93.12s |  lots and lots of renewable energy
93.12s - 95.24s |  and transitioning to this more clean,
95.24s - 97.92s |  digital, affordable system also.
97.92s - 100.28s |  But just, I am a power grid person,
100.28s - 101.84s |  so in all of these talks I give a
101.84s - 103.44s |  what is the power grid to everyone.
103.44s - 105.20s |  If you come to one of my power grid talks
105.20s - 108.04s |  at a power conference, you won't hear this part.
108.04s - 111.08s |  But how does the system work and how has it worked?
111.08s - 112.88s |  We've essentially for a very long time
112.88s - 115.56s |  had power that flows from large spinning generators
115.56s - 117.76s |  around the country all the way down
118.24s - 121.76s |  through our large power lines down to small customers,
121.76s - 124.72s |  sub-transmission, primary customers, your houses.
124.72s - 126.92s |  That's been the way it's been for a very long time.
126.92s - 129.16s |  Since the beginning of all power grid time,
129.16s - 130.76s |  it has looked this way.
130.76s - 131.60s |  And that's changing.
131.60s - 133.80s |  We have massive amounts of things happening
133.80s - 136.04s |  to do with energy storage, which is the primary focus
136.04s - 138.08s |  of this discussion today.
138.08s - 140.64s |  We have electric vehicles plugging in everywhere.
140.64s - 142.64s |  We also have things like the cloud.
142.64s - 144.20s |  A lot of the small utilities are trying
144.20s - 146.64s |  to modernize at the moment and their only option
146.68s - 149.72s |  for modernization is actually using cloud-based applications
149.72s - 151.08s |  in lots of places.
151.08s - 154.16s |  They can't install data centers in tiny utilities.
154.16s - 156.20s |  I will say I've seen the convergence
156.20s - 157.20s |  of these things recently.
157.20s - 158.72s |  I was working with a small utility
158.72s - 162.48s |  and they had had a massive tornado come through
162.48s - 164.44s |  that took out one of their operations center
164.44s - 168.44s |  and their data center was effectively Dorothied into a river.
168.44s - 172.08s |  So there's a lot happening together in the power grid
172.08s - 174.60s |  and things there are there, so.
174.60s - 176.44s |  But what does energy transition mean to me
176.44s - 178.60s |  and to a lot of people?
178.60s - 179.96s |  I said big spinning machines
179.96s - 183.00s |  as in these big rotating generators that are there.
183.00s - 184.56s |  They've been there forever.
184.56s - 185.88s |  They're very reliable.
185.88s - 187.44s |  They've been around a long time.
187.44s - 189.84s |  Big spinning metal, effectively.
189.84s - 191.92s |  They've been traditionally manufactured around the country
191.92s - 194.72s |  and most of that has a decent sized U.S. base
194.72s - 196.24s |  for manufacture.
196.24s - 197.92s |  I'll use the spoiler alert here.
197.92s - 200.32s |  As we transition to things like solar storage,
200.32s - 202.68s |  lots of distributed systems,
202.72s - 204.60s |  it's gonna be massive distributed connected
204.60s - 206.76s |  solid state devices all over the place
206.76s - 208.20s |  with lots of numbers of them
208.20s - 209.76s |  where there was one big generator
209.76s - 212.12s |  that now might be 10,000 smaller devices
212.12s - 215.24s |  connected together, providing power to our grid.
215.24s - 218.04s |  And the spoiler alert is with largely Chinese manufacturers.
218.04s - 220.76s |  So most of this is manufactured in China
220.76s - 222.08s |  and that's why I'm talking today.
222.08s - 224.32s |  But if you like the light's been on today,
224.32s - 227.36s |  this is just what this means to you in the room.
227.36s - 229.60s |  The MGM is the biggest solar rooftop
229.60s - 231.24s |  in the world at the moment.
231.24s - 233.52s |  If you can see on top of the MGM,
233.52s - 235.72s |  that's apparently the largest owner of solar
235.72s - 237.36s |  in this area on a rooftop.
237.36s - 239.00s |  It's kind of amazing actually
239.00s - 240.64s |  when you look at the rooftops of Vegas,
240.64s - 242.92s |  you start to see this solar stuff everywhere.
243.88s - 246.32s |  The energy storage is actually wildly useful
246.32s - 247.68s |  just now for us.
247.68s - 250.88s |  Both Texas and California have had major events
250.88s - 253.32s |  that required them to ramp up fast generators
253.32s - 255.08s |  to provide power really quickly.
256.12s - 258.40s |  Both of them, I think it's been around 17 emergency
258.44s - 262.48s |  dispatches of storage generation in California,
262.48s - 264.52s |  I believe in the last couple of years,
264.52s - 266.68s |  meaning a grid operator sitting there going,
266.68s - 268.64s |  we need power really fast,
268.64s - 270.80s |  asking them to do an immediate control action
270.80s - 272.96s |  to discharge all of their power.
272.96s - 274.08s |  That's kind of a big deal.
274.08s - 275.68s |  It's an immediate action that needs to be taken
275.68s - 277.00s |  to stop the lights going off.
277.00s - 279.56s |  So this energy storage has been doing it.
279.56s - 281.68s |  That picture on the right was in Texas,
281.68s - 285.68s |  I believe January this year when a gigawatt of batteries
285.68s - 287.96s |  ramped up to sort of save the day.
288.48s - 289.76s |  And that was a good thing.
290.60s - 293.72s |  But current state of supply, this is a weird graph,
293.72s - 296.84s |  but last year after this conference,
296.84s - 299.32s |  I was at another renewable energy conference
299.32s - 300.16s |  in the same place.
300.16s - 301.88s |  It's the biggest renewable energy conference,
301.88s - 303.12s |  I believe, in the world.
304.24s - 306.16s |  I've worked in renewable energy for a long time
306.16s - 309.56s |  and sort of watched the change of the supply chain here.
309.56s - 312.00s |  Me and one of my other cyber colleagues,
312.00s - 313.84s |  there was only about three of us there,
313.84s - 316.20s |  were walking around the shop floor,
316.20s - 317.48s |  the expo floor as you do,
318.00s - 319.04s |  trying to look at all the gear
319.04s - 321.16s |  and realized that almost everything we were looking at
321.16s - 322.40s |  was a Chinese company.
322.40s - 325.16s |  It wasn't hidden, it wasn't covert,
325.16s - 327.40s |  it wasn't a mysterious component we were finding
327.40s - 329.68s |  in a device in critical infrastructure.
329.68s - 331.52s |  It was straight up people that are,
331.52s - 334.60s |  everyone is from China essentially was at this conference.
334.60s - 336.08s |  And it was kind of a moment of change
336.08s - 337.80s |  where before I would have said,
337.80s - 339.88s |  we've got US manufacturer, we're building this.
339.88s - 341.08s |  And I was kind of looking at it like,
341.08s - 344.64s |  ah, I'm not sure we do and we're not hiding it.
344.64s - 346.24s |  So this is a big challenge.
346.92s - 349.60s |  I used this example here of,
349.60s - 351.84s |  this was what the conference expo floor looked like.
351.84s - 354.16s |  Orange is everything is from China
355.08s - 357.68s |  and every other color is anywhere else.
357.68s - 359.60s |  I think green I'd put in was Germany
359.60s - 362.60s |  and blue is the US manufacturer as well.
362.60s - 366.24s |  So about 95 to 100% of our digital components available
366.24s - 369.96s |  right now have a Chinese made, owned or derived
369.96s - 372.32s |  control or software component in it as well.
372.32s - 374.84s |  So that is where we're at.
374.84s - 377.92s |  But another sort of supply chain event that happened
377.92s - 381.24s |  has been my life for the past two years actually.
381.24s - 386.24s |  In April, 2023, a large military base
386.52s - 389.76s |  announced they were installing and I think commissioning,
389.76s - 392.12s |  the picture on the bottom left is that one,
392.12s - 395.96s |  commissioning their giant new battery on Camp Lejeune.
395.96s - 398.20s |  And basically they took a nice picture
398.20s - 400.12s |  with the command cutting the ribbon
400.12s - 402.40s |  with cattle written behind their head,
402.40s - 405.12s |  which is one of the largest battery manufacturers
405.12s - 407.92s |  in the world who is a Chinese company.
407.92s - 410.40s |  And so given the defense posture that we look at
410.40s - 412.64s |  from components that we're using,
412.64s - 414.80s |  this was definitely a moment of us all looking at the TV
414.80s - 416.68s |  going, why'd you take that selfie?
416.68s - 417.80s |  Come on.
417.80s - 420.12s |  So everyone sort of started to catch on
420.12s - 422.16s |  that this was where we were at.
422.16s - 423.88s |  Again, this led to a series of events
423.88s - 425.76s |  that have been the rest of my life,
425.76s - 428.52s |  which was dealing with there being various,
428.52s - 430.16s |  like we're saying that Chinese hackers
430.16s - 432.44s |  are preparing to attack our infrastructure.
432.44s - 433.28s |  That is known.
434.20s - 437.52s |  Following that, about a year later, this was in December,
437.52s - 439.24s |  the large utility announced
439.24s - 440.92s |  that they were disconnecting that battery
440.92s - 444.20s |  that had been put on Camp Lejeune,
444.20s - 446.28s |  citing there was security concerns with it.
446.28s - 447.52s |  Okay.
447.52s - 451.40s |  But this led to about 10 or 20 utilities in the country
451.40s - 456.28s |  starting to call and say, wait, don't we have those as well?
456.28s - 457.32s |  Are we meant to do something?
457.32s - 459.20s |  And we're like, ah, okay.
459.60s - 460.56s |  I was like, first of all,
460.56s - 462.16s |  can I get that battery for a minute?
462.16s - 463.56s |  And then second, they were like,
463.56s - 465.48s |  everyone was just panicking at this point
465.48s - 467.28s |  that both their boards were yelling at them
467.28s - 470.00s |  and they were concerned from a security perspective
470.00s - 473.48s |  and asking for resources for how are they going to secure
473.48s - 476.12s |  this because they can't get rid of it.
476.12s - 479.40s |  They can't afford to ditch their $10 million investment
479.40s - 481.32s |  and just buy something else.
481.32s - 483.68s |  And even then there wasn't anything else for them to buy.
483.68s - 486.24s |  So a lot of people were calling and panicking
486.24s - 488.32s |  and various things going on.
488.36s - 491.24s |  Then I will say we move on to now.
491.24s - 494.24s |  I believe the largest solar plus storage project
494.24s - 498.40s |  in the world came online about a couple months ago.
498.40s - 501.16s |  It is connected to another military base also.
501.16s - 502.68s |  When they announced this, they were saying,
502.68s - 504.56s |  great, we've got our new batteries here.
504.56s - 506.96s |  And then it was another one of the battery companies
506.96s - 509.72s |  that's listed just now on the banned battery list
509.72s - 512.32s |  on the National Defense Authorization Act.
512.32s - 514.08s |  They announced it in the news though.
514.08s - 516.08s |  So every time I read one of these news stories,
516.08s - 518.00s |  I'm like, but there's a list
518.68s - 519.88s |  and it's written and we're okay.
519.88s - 521.20s |  And then they announced it on the news
521.20s - 522.84s |  and more calls start.
522.84s - 524.00s |  So that's been my life.
524.88s - 527.48s |  The other thing that happened a few years ago,
527.48s - 529.40s |  we obviously banned Huawei.
529.40s - 530.96s |  That was a big deal.
530.96s - 531.96s |  They actually had the market
531.96s - 534.04s |  for various things of equipment.
534.04s - 537.24s |  And about, I think four days ago,
537.24s - 538.76s |  Pentagon officials were announcing
538.76s - 542.20s |  that they would like a waiver from the Huawei ban now
542.20s - 544.40s |  because they can't get rid of the equipment.
544.40s - 547.12s |  So if the Pentagon's asking for the waiver,
547.16s - 550.12s |  rip and replace probably hasn't worked that well for Huawei.
550.12s - 552.68s |  So going the same approach with the batteries
552.68s - 555.88s |  is essentially the policy topic of my talk.
556.92s - 558.36s |  So how'd we get here?
558.36s - 560.20s |  Why did we end up this way?
560.20s - 561.64s |  If you read any news stories,
561.64s - 565.36s |  they try and blame whoever is in leadership right now.
565.36s - 567.40s |  It's always the latest leader's problem
567.40s - 568.88s |  that this has happened.
568.88s - 572.20s |  But we started this probably 10 or 12 years ago.
572.20s - 574.16s |  We prioritized low cost and volume
574.16s - 576.44s |  for solar storage and renewable energy.
576.44s - 577.28s |  It's great.
577.28s - 579.28s |  We needed cheaper products for this to actually happen
579.28s - 580.92s |  because we do need renewable energy.
580.92s - 584.56s |  That's the sort of theme here is we need this to happen.
584.56s - 587.92s |  But how we got there, we prioritized low cost.
587.92s - 589.84s |  That meant we shift a lot of this offshore.
589.84s - 591.08s |  That's just how it happens.
591.08s - 593.64s |  We've started to manufacture it in China.
593.64s - 595.24s |  And then we did get that low cost.
595.24s - 597.92s |  We reached a dollar a watt in 2015, I believe.
597.92s - 600.20s |  And then it's gone down from there.
600.20s - 601.04s |  But now we're at this point,
601.04s - 604.28s |  we just don't really build a lot of this in the US.
604.28s - 605.92s |  We might soon.
605.92s - 608.80s |  But investors need a demand signal.
608.80s - 610.88s |  If we said we're gonna get rid of all the batteries
610.88s - 612.92s |  and we're not gonna do this anymore,
612.92s - 616.04s |  the investors aren't going to invest in new batteries
616.04s - 618.20s |  being built here for another five years.
618.20s - 620.44s |  So what will we do in the interim?
620.44s - 622.00s |  I use this picture on the right.
622.00s - 626.64s |  It was from Bloomberg a few, about four years ago.
626.64s - 627.48s |  It was actually, again,
627.48s - 629.96s |  I love to use media stories as being funny.
629.96s - 631.92s |  But it said basically,
631.92s - 635.36s |  the US is number two in the world on battery manufacture.
635.88s - 638.12s |  They are not that big line, so we're clear.
638.12s - 641.48s |  We are not the large line, that was China.
641.48s - 642.60s |  So we are number two,
642.60s - 645.52s |  but we also lost by about eight laps of this.
645.52s - 647.12s |  So we've got a lot of making up to do
647.12s - 649.56s |  if we want to be competing in here.
649.56s - 652.24s |  Just some quick facts and figures quickly.
652.24s - 654.64s |  Huawei is still the number one inverter
654.64s - 658.36s |  or power conversion manufacturer in the world.
658.36s - 660.60s |  When they exited the market from the US,
660.60s - 661.72s |  they went from number two
661.72s - 664.20s |  to number one in the world somehow.
664.20s - 666.16s |  So that didn't necessarily work.
666.16s - 667.12s |  What makes it different?
667.12s - 669.12s |  Volume and regulation.
669.12s - 672.12s |  There's about 73 named inverter manufacturers.
672.12s - 675.80s |  So when I said we have large spinning generators,
675.80s - 677.44s |  those are generally made by probably
677.44s - 679.88s |  about three or four companies at this point.
679.88s - 681.84s |  When we look at inverters and more particularly
681.84s - 684.40s |  look at vulnerability analysis of inverters,
684.40s - 685.84s |  you've got 73 companies
685.84s - 688.28s |  and about 1,500 different models to look at
688.28s - 691.12s |  that we haven't done that type of analysis on yet.
691.12s - 692.80s |  And that's just now.
692.80s - 694.36s |  If you look at battery vendors as well,
694.36s - 695.84s |  we're in the same place.
695.84s - 697.88s |  There's integrators of these equipment.
697.88s - 699.80s |  A lot of the equipment is actually same hardware,
699.80s - 701.24s |  different label.
701.24s - 703.68s |  Still, we need to do a lot of that analysis.
703.68s - 707.00s |  But the hardware is often similar.
707.00s - 708.44s |  And then we also have features
708.44s - 710.84s |  like remote communication and access as necessary
710.84s - 713.24s |  because if you have lots and lots and lots of devices,
713.24s - 715.48s |  you kind of need them to get updated as well
715.48s - 717.56s |  with all those nice patches that we need all the time.
717.56s - 719.52s |  So remote comms is a big deal.
720.52s - 723.28s |  There are some common challenges we have
723.28s - 725.92s |  in renewable control systems in particular.
725.92s - 727.64s |  They work pretty well just now.
727.64s - 729.56s |  But again, inverters and power electronics,
729.56s - 733.20s |  we see spinning generators last 40, 50 years.
733.20s - 735.16s |  They're mostly older than all of us.
736.16s - 738.68s |  Well, some of us, not looking at anyone else.
738.68s - 741.76s |  But they're mostly older than all of us.
741.76s - 745.48s |  But inverters tend to fail about every 15 years.
745.48s - 747.96s |  So we actually have opportunity to get rid of them
747.96s - 749.56s |  and get new ones eventually.
749.56s - 751.92s |  But they do fail about every 15 years.
751.92s - 753.80s |  Things that cause challenges with them.
753.80s - 754.68s |  Failing chips.
754.68s - 756.76s |  We have chipsets that just don't work very well
756.76s - 758.64s |  in lots of cheap systems.
758.64s - 760.08s |  Persistent communications.
760.08s - 762.08s |  We have to communicate with these devices
762.08s - 762.92s |  for them to work,
762.92s - 765.72s |  but that's obviously a threat or a risk.
765.72s - 768.68s |  Hard-coded passwords are freaking everywhere.
768.68s - 771.64s |  Like, absolutely everywhere.
771.64s - 773.04s |  And we can't, I'll talk why,
773.04s - 775.72s |  but we can't do a ton about that right now.
775.76s - 778.68s |  Operations and maintenance is a fourth-party person
778.68s - 780.04s |  that will come in and do things.
780.04s - 781.96s |  There's white-labeled products.
781.96s - 783.48s |  Insecure applications.
783.48s - 786.20s |  Some of the primary vulnerabilities we've had
786.20s - 788.80s |  in these devices have been app-based.
788.80s - 790.48s |  It's the cool little app you use
790.48s - 792.56s |  to log on to your solar power.
792.56s - 793.88s |  Most of them are kind of junk.
793.88s - 795.96s |  So here we are.
795.96s - 798.00s |  There's not really any software bill of materials
798.00s - 799.08s |  that comes with these things.
799.08s - 799.96s |  And even if it did,
799.96s - 802.56s |  we probably wouldn't trust it at this point.
802.56s - 805.80s |  And again, there's really no vulnerability disclosure
805.80s - 807.52s |  for the devices that are not made
807.52s - 808.84s |  either in the US or Germany.
808.84s - 811.04s |  We just don't have it because they're made in China.
811.04s - 815.80s |  So what's more common in the Chinese-manufactured products?
815.80s - 819.88s |  In particular, apart from the white-labeled products
819.88s - 821.52s |  are not necessarily there.
821.52s - 823.72s |  But these are things that are very, very common
823.72s - 826.56s |  in the products that we're seeing being imported as well.
826.56s - 828.48s |  And that's a challenge.
828.48s - 830.72s |  These things are difficult to fix as well
830.72s - 832.32s |  because a lot of those vulnerabilities,
833.08s - 835.16s |  even if we find them, who's gonna fix them?
835.16s - 837.84s |  So we're kind of in this interesting point.
837.84s - 840.68s |  The hard-coded password thing has been coming up a lot
840.68s - 843.00s |  and it's something we really need to fix.
843.00s - 845.56s |  But the models are a big challenge.
846.52s - 849.20s |  We like to say there have been no events
849.20s - 850.80s |  on renewable energy infrastructure
850.80s - 852.76s |  that have caused the power to go out.
852.76s - 854.40s |  So there have been no cyber events
854.40s - 855.64s |  that have caused a power outage.
855.64s - 856.48s |  There have been events
856.48s - 858.20s |  that have caused a communications outage
858.20s - 861.44s |  or denial of service on communications
861.44s - 863.52s |  or loss of visibility.
863.52s - 865.80s |  There's also been a number of ransomware events
865.80s - 868.56s |  starting all the way back in 2014.
868.56s - 871.60s |  There's been a number of sort of ransomware,
871.60s - 874.40s |  different wind turbine events also.
874.40s - 876.24s |  Again, ransomware is bad,
876.24s - 878.60s |  but it's not necessarily turned the power off.
878.60s - 881.08s |  Nobody hit the big red button.
881.08s - 883.16s |  Some of the more interesting ones in the US,
883.16s - 886.08s |  there was a company that had a denial of service attack
886.08s - 888.60s |  in 2019 there in Utah.
888.60s - 891.20s |  Very, very large manufacturer
891.20s - 893.48s |  or sort of very large owner of wind power.
893.48s - 895.12s |  They had a denial of service attack
895.12s - 896.68s |  that essentially took down comms.
896.68s - 898.44s |  They couldn't see it.
898.44s - 899.96s |  When you lose comms to renewable energy,
899.96s - 901.96s |  most things will stay online.
901.96s - 903.64s |  They won't necessarily fail,
903.64s - 905.12s |  but over time they will start to fail.
905.12s - 907.20s |  So you do still need to get that back.
907.20s - 908.66s |  These things are happening.
908.66s - 909.90s |  We do have challenges.
911.36s - 914.08s |  But some key points from a policy perspective,
914.08s - 915.68s |  we've put a lot of responsibility
915.68s - 918.60s |  for securing these devices on the average consumer.
918.60s - 920.24s |  So if you have an inverter
920.24s - 922.00s |  or solar installation in your house
922.00s - 923.70s |  or battery installation,
923.70s - 924.88s |  generally you're the consumer
924.88s - 927.68s |  or you're the one responsible for updating the system.
927.68s - 929.80s |  We're also putting them everywhere.
929.80s - 931.84s |  The example here, we are putting them on
931.84s - 935.04s |  lots of low income and disadvantaged community locations,
935.04s - 937.08s |  multifamily housing.
937.08s - 937.92s |  That's a challenge.
937.92s - 938.88s |  Who's gonna update that?
938.88s - 940.04s |  Who's in charge of it?
940.04s - 940.88s |  Who's doing that?
940.88s - 943.16s |  We're saying this is to help people with their energy bills,
943.16s - 944.94s |  but we're also then giving them products
944.98s - 947.26s |  that potentially have security vulnerabilities
947.26s - 949.10s |  that cause them more challenges.
949.10s - 951.44s |  But we put the responsibility on the consumer,
951.44s - 955.18s |  whether these devices have one or 92 vulnerabilities in them,
955.18s - 956.46s |  the person that's updating it
956.46s - 958.74s |  is the person standing beside it that owns it,
958.74s - 961.66s |  not necessarily the company connecting to it,
961.66s - 963.90s |  but they're responsible for securing these devices
963.90s - 966.38s |  because when there was an end phase
966.38s - 970.70s |  had a pretty bad vulnerability that came out
970.70s - 973.10s |  and in the instructions of how to fix it,
973.10s - 974.78s |  it was essentially the consumers need to go
975.62s - 976.46s |  and do something and reboot it.
976.46s - 978.10s |  So it was a very long list of things
978.10s - 980.46s |  that we were expecting, say, Joe down the road to do.
980.46s - 981.84s |  No offense, Joe's in the room.
981.84s - 983.78s |  There's like 14 of them.
983.78s - 985.30s |  But we're expecting someone down the road
985.30s - 986.30s |  to go and fix all of that.
986.30s - 988.06s |  And reading the analysis that came out,
988.06s - 990.98s |  I was like, eh, I'm not sure anyone's gonna touch that.
990.98s - 992.26s |  I think that's just gonna go
992.26s - 994.10s |  and everyone's gonna leave it alone.
995.30s - 996.98s |  But I talked a lot about
996.98s - 999.04s |  sort of what the IT level attacks look like,
999.04s - 1001.24s |  but the industrial control system landscape
1001.24s - 1002.94s |  for a supply chain style attack
1002.98s - 1005.66s |  looks a lot more like what happened with SolarWinds.
1005.66s - 1008.46s |  I made these slides before CrowdStrike, so we're clear.
1008.46s - 1013.22s |  But it looks a lot like what happened with SolarWinds.
1013.22s - 1016.50s |  Like pushing out mass firmware to these devices
1016.50s - 1018.46s |  is actually a pretty useful feature.
1018.46s - 1020.88s |  I mentioned the customer's responsible.
1020.88s - 1022.46s |  Pushing it out to millions of devices
1022.46s - 1023.94s |  is actually pretty useful.
1023.94s - 1025.58s |  It's had problems.
1025.58s - 1028.74s |  There was a mass push out to an island
1028.74s - 1030.70s |  of a lot of inverters that came out.
1030.70s - 1032.02s |  They pushed a firmware device out
1032.02s - 1034.02s |  and everything stopped working for a minute.
1034.02s - 1035.10s |  That wasn't great.
1036.06s - 1038.62s |  But software events have happened.
1038.62s - 1041.70s |  When there was an event in California recently,
1041.70s - 1043.54s |  the batteries weren't working properly
1043.54s - 1045.86s |  during a heat event, effectively.
1045.86s - 1047.26s |  One of the things they did to fix it
1047.26s - 1048.50s |  was a hot software fix,
1048.50s - 1050.10s |  where they pushed out a new software
1050.10s - 1051.14s |  to the device immediately
1051.14s - 1052.94s |  and got it to start responding properly
1052.94s - 1054.46s |  and start working again.
1054.46s - 1057.66s |  Great, but that is also a potential vector
1057.66s - 1060.06s |  for problems to come, as we all now know.
1061.06s - 1062.66s |  But like I said, technically,
1062.66s - 1064.86s |  what makes them a risk is a benefit.
1064.86s - 1068.42s |  The other issue on our battery and inverter supply chain
1068.42s - 1072.34s |  is that the batteries are actually getting better over time.
1072.34s - 1075.74s |  So we don't really make them here, like I've said,
1075.74s - 1077.14s |  but they're getting better.
1077.14s - 1078.26s |  That's the problem.
1078.26s - 1080.66s |  If we look at quality of the batteries over time,
1080.66s - 1082.78s |  if we look at the fires that have happened,
1082.78s - 1084.10s |  they're pretty well-published.
1084.10s - 1086.06s |  There's a number of fires,
1086.06s - 1087.70s |  thermal runaways when batteries
1087.70s - 1089.54s |  just go out of control and fire,
1089.94s - 1092.54s |  potentially, is an electrochemical reaction.
1092.54s - 1094.50s |  There's been less, if we look at all the data
1094.50s - 1095.94s |  that's been collected.
1095.94s - 1097.62s |  I think it's since 2018
1097.62s - 1099.86s |  that's decreased drastically, actually.
1099.86s - 1101.34s |  Partially, that's because,
1101.34s - 1104.38s |  and there's been some news on this recently,
1104.38s - 1106.78s |  Chinese companies have put lots and lots of money
1106.78s - 1109.06s |  into improving the quality of their products.
1109.06s - 1111.56s |  People are being educated in doing that.
1111.56s - 1113.64s |  They also collect data from all of these.
1113.64s - 1116.10s |  We like to say that you shouldn't be communicating
1116.10s - 1117.74s |  with that, but they do collect data
1117.78s - 1119.70s |  from all of the devices
1119.70s - 1121.38s |  and look at the quality over time.
1121.38s - 1122.38s |  What that actually means is
1122.38s - 1124.98s |  there's a secondary communication device, for one,
1124.98s - 1127.90s |  but also that they are improving their product.
1127.90s - 1129.50s |  If we were actually looking to get rid
1129.50s - 1131.36s |  of these batteries entirely,
1131.36s - 1132.94s |  the only thing that's really gonna happen
1132.94s - 1135.50s |  is these companies will go to a cheaper
1135.50s - 1138.22s |  battery manufacturer or somebody else
1138.22s - 1139.28s |  that's not on this list
1139.28s - 1141.38s |  and end up potentially with more fires
1141.38s - 1144.34s |  because they've not put as much money into it.
1144.34s - 1145.86s |  We're kind of in this catch-22,
1145.86s - 1147.10s |  just now of damned if we do,
1147.10s - 1148.70s |  damned if we don't, one way or the other,
1148.70s - 1150.38s |  and that's today.
1150.38s - 1152.34s |  So what, who cares?
1152.34s - 1154.28s |  We are dependent on these.
1154.28s - 1157.38s |  There's some bad, bad, there's bad communications,
1157.38s - 1161.90s |  hard-coded passwords, and questionable software
1161.90s - 1164.10s |  used to update things.
1164.10s - 1166.66s |  There's an over-concentration of Chinese products.
1166.66s - 1168.14s |  It's a global issue.
1168.14s - 1170.26s |  I don't necessarily think if anyone was targeting
1170.26s - 1171.54s |  one particular supply chain,
1171.54s - 1173.34s |  it would just affect this country.
1173.34s - 1174.60s |  It would affect many countries
1174.64s - 1177.72s |  because those products are global at this point.
1177.72s - 1181.00s |  And we have fairly minimal control over the supply chain.
1181.00s - 1183.92s |  Even if we do actually ban a number of products,
1183.92s - 1185.12s |  it's not necessarily,
1185.12s - 1186.72s |  you can't necessarily tell private industry,
1186.72s - 1187.76s |  you will never buy this.
1187.76s - 1189.62s |  That didn't work with some of the other products.
1189.62s - 1191.76s |  So we don't necessarily have a ton of control
1191.76s - 1192.76s |  over what people buy
1192.76s - 1194.88s |  because we do have a free market here.
1194.88s - 1197.84s |  So we've got minimal control over that, really.
1198.64s - 1200.76s |  Again, I'm a failure mode person.
1200.76s - 1202.48s |  I've done a lot of work on setting things on fire,
1202.48s - 1204.54s |  so I have to talk about that for a minute.
1204.88s - 1206.10s |  What would actually happen
1206.10s - 1208.98s |  if there were a major attack on a battery?
1208.98s - 1211.30s |  Well, I mentioned loss of visibility.
1211.30s - 1213.74s |  This is the first thing that's probably the easiest
1213.74s - 1214.96s |  and has happened.
1214.96s - 1217.30s |  So essentially, if I was looking at difficulty,
1217.30s - 1219.22s |  loss of communication and loss of visibility
1219.22s - 1222.68s |  is kind of the biggest, easiest thing that can happen.
1222.68s - 1224.14s |  Again, that's when they lose status
1224.14s - 1226.02s |  monitoring our physical access alarms,
1226.02s - 1227.96s |  which can be a bigger challenge.
1227.96s - 1230.04s |  Like I said, there have been examples of this happening.
1230.04s - 1232.46s |  The attack against the Viasat network
1232.46s - 1237.18s |  during the Ukraine invasion in northern Europe
1237.18s - 1238.30s |  actually resulted in the loss
1238.30s - 1241.26s |  of about 6,000 wind turbines communication,
1241.26s - 1244.24s |  which, you know, okay, they've lost comms,
1244.24s - 1245.38s |  but they actually had to go out
1245.38s - 1247.66s |  and fix each one of these individually in the end.
1247.66s - 1251.18s |  So that was quite a big device problem, actually.
1252.38s - 1254.74s |  Other types of potential attacks.
1254.74s - 1256.86s |  If you look at a site, I mentioned fire.
1256.86s - 1258.36s |  They are an electrochemical device.
1258.36s - 1259.30s |  They do get hot.
1259.30s - 1261.74s |  Please don't open them up to take a look at that.
1262.66s - 1265.30s |  They might lose their preventive or proactive disconnect.
1265.30s - 1266.52s |  Potentially, they stay online
1266.52s - 1268.50s |  when you're trying to take them offline.
1268.50s - 1270.50s |  There could be damage to site capacity
1270.50s - 1271.66s |  and environmental discharge.
1271.66s - 1272.50s |  These things burn.
1272.50s - 1274.18s |  If anyone was around here recently
1274.18s - 1277.38s |  or tried to drive from California to LA,
1277.38s - 1279.68s |  sorry, LA to Las Vegas,
1279.68s - 1281.74s |  there was a huge lithium ion battery fire
1281.74s - 1283.90s |  in the middle of this that shut down the road.
1283.90s - 1286.02s |  And the plume from that was terrible.
1286.02s - 1287.94s |  So chemicals are bad.
1287.94s - 1290.02s |  Lastly, the most difficult style of these things
1290.02s - 1291.10s |  is electric grid impact.
1291.10s - 1292.54s |  It's the one we talk about most,
1292.54s - 1294.30s |  but it's probably the most difficult.
1294.30s - 1296.58s |  Again, to actually coordinate a massive event
1296.58s - 1298.50s |  where the lights would go out everywhere,
1298.50s - 1299.90s |  it would take a lot.
1299.90s - 1301.26s |  It would take a lot of coordination
1301.26s - 1302.90s |  with more expensive power electronics
1302.90s - 1305.50s |  than we actually have, for one, which is good.
1305.50s - 1307.22s |  But it's still a challenge.
1307.22s - 1309.82s |  We can't have these things misbehaving over the system.
1309.82s - 1311.14s |  It's a bit of a problem.
1311.14s - 1313.18s |  Okay, this is a policy talk, though.
1313.18s - 1315.30s |  So how do we fix it?
1315.30s - 1316.56s |  There are technical solutions.
1316.56s - 1318.30s |  I'm not talking about those today.
1318.30s - 1320.46s |  I'm mostly talking about, from a policy standpoint,
1320.82s - 1323.22s |  what we really need to do to help fix these problems.
1323.22s - 1326.10s |  I'd came up with four options of the direction we're going
1326.10s - 1328.34s |  and the direction I think we should go.
1328.34s - 1331.02s |  But so I was gonna talk about that a little bit.
1331.02s - 1332.46s |  Option one and option two
1332.46s - 1334.86s |  are really ban the companies, rip and replace.
1334.86s - 1336.24s |  I mentioned before we've tried this.
1336.24s - 1338.06s |  We are going down this path.
1338.06s - 1339.60s |  We've already started the process.
1339.60s - 1341.86s |  There's been 10 companies that have been banned
1341.86s - 1344.66s |  in the latest National Defense Authorization Act.
1344.66s - 1345.78s |  That's gonna increase.
1345.78s - 1348.06s |  We're looking at more and more.
1348.06s - 1349.82s |  Fair enough, that's the direction we're going,
1350.18s - 1351.66s |  but it doesn't mean we're gonna have a solution
1351.66s - 1353.82s |  that works there because people might just go buy
1353.82s - 1356.06s |  another cheaper one from the 70 list,
1356.06s - 1358.26s |  so it might just get worse.
1358.26s - 1360.94s |  But second option we're really looking at,
1360.94s - 1362.96s |  rip and replace, that's came up.
1362.96s - 1364.02s |  What does that mean?
1364.90s - 1367.50s |  Around a couple, maybe three, four years ago
1367.50s - 1370.58s |  when they banned Huawei from our networks,
1370.58s - 1374.58s |  they also put funding in place for a bunch of small utilities
1374.58s - 1376.74s |  to actually go replace all their Huawei equipment.
1376.74s - 1378.50s |  It was an order that came through,
1378.50s - 1381.10s |  and then they said, well, we're gonna put $4 billion
1381.10s - 1383.94s |  towards small utilities taking out this equipment,
1383.94s - 1386.46s |  buying new equipment, not buying Huawei.
1386.46s - 1389.62s |  That was great except we underfunded it by $3 billion.
1389.62s - 1392.74s |  So we ended up with, I believe a couple months ago,
1392.74s - 1395.22s |  $1 billion is spent out on doing this.
1395.22s - 1396.80s |  Most of the utilities have not been able
1396.80s - 1399.26s |  to actually replace the Huawei equipment
1399.26s - 1401.06s |  because they can't buy it,
1401.06s - 1403.14s |  and the funding isn't there for them to do it.
1403.14s - 1405.48s |  So that didn't work.
1405.48s - 1407.82s |  The other part is when we banned Huawei,
1407.82s - 1409.58s |  they just went from being number two
1409.58s - 1410.92s |  to number one in the world.
1410.92s - 1414.74s |  That was the strangest part of this is when we banned them,
1414.74s - 1417.34s |  and they actually did the market in 2019 in the US.
1417.34s - 1421.18s |  In 2022, they were the top number one globally
1421.18s - 1422.78s |  of inverter shipments in the world.
1422.78s - 1425.30s |  So again, rip and replace is not really,
1425.30s - 1428.54s |  or even banning them is not necessarily the best beginning.
1429.94s - 1432.18s |  Well, but now, again, if I only did the math
1432.18s - 1434.34s |  on what we actually need to do
1434.34s - 1437.06s |  to replace all the batteries in the system,
1437.06s - 1439.82s |  at least in one state, it would be around $4 billion.
1439.82s - 1441.08s |  So look at previous number
1441.08s - 1443.30s |  for what we didn't fund the first time.
1443.30s - 1445.46s |  I believe, I think in the US, I did the math,
1445.46s - 1448.26s |  it was around $15 billion in the US
1448.26s - 1450.66s |  to replace what we have currently installed or in line.
1450.66s - 1452.94s |  So I don't think that's gonna happen.
1452.94s - 1454.46s |  I don't know who's gonna push that bill,
1454.46s - 1456.18s |  but it's not gonna.
1456.18s - 1458.82s |  There's about 70 options, as it are 80 now.
1458.82s - 1461.14s |  Again, they pop up from launched integration
1461.14s - 1462.18s |  in about one year.
1462.18s - 1464.06s |  That's just material.
1464.06s - 1465.86s |  We'll end up playing whack-a-mole just forever.
1465.86s - 1467.86s |  If you keep banning one, the next one will come up.
1467.86s - 1468.98s |  We'll have to ban them.
1468.98s - 1469.86s |  We'll just keep going
1469.86s - 1471.82s |  until we have a really confused supply chain
1471.82s - 1473.58s |  and no one knows who to buy it from.
1473.58s - 1475.94s |  It'll also stop what we're doing currently.
1475.94s - 1477.98s |  We will not be able to transition the grid
1477.98s - 1480.42s |  if we keep going down this path.
1480.42s - 1482.14s |  They do have a fire issue, like I said,
1482.14s - 1484.46s |  but the ones that have caused more of the fires
1484.46s - 1486.70s |  have not actually been on the ban list.
1486.70s - 1489.12s |  So despite the fact they've had a natural physical impact
1489.12s - 1492.18s |  of a piece of device or a fire,
1492.18s - 1494.58s |  they're just not on a ban list yet for some reason.
1495.38s - 1497.78s |  We're kind of stuck in these two worlds.
1497.78s - 1500.54s |  Again, I try not to be super negative,
1500.54s - 1503.14s |  but there is progress, there is investment in the country.
1503.14s - 1504.26s |  The Chips for America Act
1504.26s - 1506.14s |  is bringing in a lot of the manufacture of chips,
1506.14s - 1509.58s |  which will help solve some of our power electronics problems
1509.58s - 1512.78s |  in a few years, probably not right now.
1512.78s - 1514.10s |  Also, there is investment
1514.10s - 1516.50s |  in battery cell material being built,
1516.50s - 1518.06s |  which is all over the country.
1518.06s - 1520.34s |  But again, we have five to 10 years
1520.34s - 1521.66s |  before that's a reality.
1521.66s - 1523.54s |  So we have to keep going,
1523.54s - 1524.78s |  and that's not necessarily gonna work.
1524.78s - 1527.02s |  We also, again, still need the demand signal.
1527.94s - 1529.38s |  The other problem we have
1529.38s - 1532.10s |  is actually inspecting the equipment.
1532.10s - 1534.14s |  There's a lot of vulnerability analysis programs,
1534.14s - 1536.38s |  that's great, but if I look at the list
1536.38s - 1538.66s |  of the inverters that have been analyzed,
1538.66s - 1543.66s |  most of them aren't really reported through any US entity.
1544.50s - 1545.62s |  We aren't necessarily saying
1545.62s - 1547.22s |  that this is on the vulnerability list,
1547.22s - 1549.18s |  here's what you need to fix.
1549.18s - 1551.22s |  It's something from a policy perspective,
1551.22s - 1552.94s |  I would love to see change.
1552.98s - 1555.14s |  I believe that when we bring in products
1555.14s - 1557.74s |  to this country to use on our critical infrastructure,
1557.74s - 1559.34s |  we should be able to analyze it,
1559.34s - 1560.58s |  we should be able to look inside it,
1560.58s - 1562.66s |  and we should be able to push that out
1562.66s - 1564.18s |  for other people to fix.
1564.18s - 1566.06s |  It's a contract teeth issue
1566.06s - 1567.38s |  that we kind of need at the moment.
1567.38s - 1569.26s |  And I think I believe it needs to be pushed
1569.26s - 1570.22s |  from the national level,
1570.22s - 1572.14s |  so people can actually change their contracts,
1572.14s - 1574.50s |  so we can start doing this kind of work.
1574.50s - 1575.38s |  But it's a huge challenge.
1575.38s - 1578.18s |  We have the technology and we have the capability.
1578.18s - 1580.66s |  We could keep these inverters and just analyze them,
1580.66s - 1582.18s |  but we need to actually push back
1582.18s - 1583.62s |  on the rules that we have in place
1583.62s - 1585.58s |  for us not really looking at these devices
1585.58s - 1587.38s |  or reporting it.
1587.38s - 1588.98s |  Just, it'd be a deterrence,
1588.98s - 1589.94s |  it'd be really good to actually say
1589.94s - 1591.14s |  we're gonna analyze this equipment
1591.14s - 1593.10s |  and we're gonna report vulnerabilities.
1593.10s - 1595.62s |  But there's a trade-off there also.
1595.62s - 1596.46s |  I'm speeding up,
1596.46s - 1598.34s |  because I'm probably running out of time.
1598.34s - 1601.46s |  But like I said, we have had analysis done
1601.46s - 1603.18s |  on many of the common products,
1603.18s - 1604.42s |  and that's happening.
1604.42s - 1606.18s |  We need this for all of them, though.
1606.18s - 1608.54s |  If we're gonna use all of these devices,
1608.54s - 1610.90s |  we need the ability to analyze what's inside them
1610.90s - 1611.98s |  and keep doing that.
1613.26s - 1614.90s |  Just on the last part,
1614.90s - 1617.90s |  we need to have better contract requirements for people.
1617.90s - 1619.30s |  Again, this is policy talk,
1619.30s - 1622.50s |  but contracts are one of our bigger problems.
1622.50s - 1623.98s |  People write contracts
1623.98s - 1625.90s |  that don't necessarily put into there,
1625.90s - 1626.94s |  we're gonna look at your equipment,
1626.94s - 1631.42s |  or we need to have particular TMZs for your firmware.
1631.42s - 1632.62s |  We don't put in monitoring.
1632.62s - 1634.86s |  We have to fix our contracting.
1634.86s - 1636.02s |  But just lastly,
1636.02s - 1638.78s |  the last one that keeps coming up is regulation.
1639.74s - 1640.58s |  We're saying,
1640.58s - 1642.18s |  oh, we're gonna regulate clean energy security.
1642.18s - 1644.42s |  These companies will be under NRCSIP,
1644.42s - 1646.54s |  which is the critical infrastructure protection rules
1646.54s - 1647.78s |  in this country.
1647.78s - 1649.34s |  I'm not sure who we're gonna regulate.
1649.34s - 1651.34s |  So just in the last piece,
1651.34s - 1653.30s |  or who is going to regulate them.
1654.94s - 1656.50s |  There's one site I was looking at
1656.50s - 1659.06s |  that had one developer and owner,
1659.06s - 1662.26s |  they sold those site rights to somebody else
1662.26s - 1663.62s |  who are finance bros.
1663.62s - 1664.82s |  Sorry, that's my running joke,
1664.82s - 1666.10s |  that they keep selling these sites
1666.10s - 1667.38s |  to finance bro companies,
1667.38s - 1669.26s |  which isn't necessarily the greatest idea
1669.26s - 1671.58s |  when they own a gigawatt of generation.
1671.58s - 1672.42s |  I don't know how many of them
1672.42s - 1674.14s |  you want in charge of a gigawatt of generation,
1674.14s - 1675.66s |  so we're clear.
1675.66s - 1676.98s |  That site was developed.
1676.98s - 1680.02s |  That owner then sold that again to another French company.
1680.02s - 1681.70s |  So now we have a site
1681.70s - 1684.10s |  that owns a gigawatt of generation in one state
1684.10s - 1687.38s |  that is owned by a French company.
1687.38s - 1688.50s |  Okay, fair enough.
1688.50s - 1690.38s |  It's physically connected to our grid though.
1690.38s - 1691.78s |  So there's a utility over here
1691.78s - 1694.06s |  that has the electrons flowing to it.
1694.06s - 1695.50s |  And then there's the components
1695.50s - 1696.84s |  that are manufactured in China.
1697.24s - 1698.96s |  There's the third party operations and maintenance
1698.96s - 1700.04s |  that's somewhere else.
1700.04s - 1701.80s |  Then there's this fourth party operator
1701.80s - 1705.68s |  somewhere over here doing something else, which is weird.
1705.68s - 1707.36s |  And then they bid into the market.
1707.36s - 1708.64s |  This one was in Texas,
1708.64s - 1710.56s |  but they're still bidding into the market.
1710.56s - 1711.68s |  So they have this connection
1711.68s - 1714.52s |  to the operator for the state also.
1714.52s - 1716.12s |  So I've been trying to work out for a while,
1716.12s - 1718.48s |  which person is the regulated one?
1718.48s - 1720.60s |  Who's registering as the generator here?
1720.60s - 1722.40s |  Who's the one that follows the rules?
1722.40s - 1724.32s |  I'm not sure which one it is at this point.
1724.32s - 1726.20s |  So we need to work that out
1726.56s - 1729.16s |  if we're gonna do anything from enforcing different things.
1729.16s - 1730.00s |  I'll leave this up here.
1730.00s - 1730.84s |  It was my last slide,
1730.84s - 1732.96s |  but we will not have time to cover it.
1732.96s - 1734.92s |  A while ago, we did run an exercise
1734.92s - 1737.24s |  on the case I just said,
1737.24s - 1739.40s |  but running an exercise of what if we essentially
1739.40s - 1741.36s |  did an emergency mass push of firmware
1741.36s - 1744.36s |  to millions of inverter devices at the same time
1744.36s - 1746.84s |  and brick them all with a lot of people in the room
1746.84s - 1749.40s |  trying to, not that that ever happens,
1749.40s - 1753.32s |  but we ran this exercise trying to get some good answers
1753.32s - 1755.12s |  from all of those people that have ownership
1755.12s - 1757.72s |  to work out whose problem this really would be.
1757.72s - 1759.24s |  And it was one of the more confusing things
1759.24s - 1760.64s |  we've ever had to do because everyone
1760.64s - 1762.84s |  was just kind of staring at me with a,
1762.84s - 1764.68s |  that doesn't seem good, that's not good.
1764.68s - 1766.00s |  I was like, okay, great.
1766.00s - 1768.00s |  So we won't have time to cover it,
1768.00s - 1770.00s |  but these are the sort of questions we were asking
1770.00s - 1773.56s |  and things we were thinking about here on what if we did,
1773.56s - 1775.16s |  we called it the sun splat exercise,
1775.16s - 1776.76s |  which I'm still pretty proud of,
1776.76s - 1779.64s |  but it was essentially if what if we happened
1779.64s - 1782.28s |  to mass push things and brick everything
1782.28s - 1783.56s |  and who would fix it?
1783.56s - 1785.12s |  With the idea that someone would actually have
1785.12s - 1788.26s |  to manually go fix millions of devices at the same time.
1788.26s - 1789.56s |  Again, that never happens.
1790.88s - 1794.00s |  Well, that's my summary, but again, we need to do this.
1794.00s - 1795.28s |  We're stuck between two worlds,
1795.28s - 1797.04s |  but we have to get renewable energy
1797.04s - 1797.96s |  and clean energy out there.
1797.96s - 1800.72s |  It's just a fact, we do not want to keep going
1800.72s - 1802.44s |  with climate change the way it is.
1802.44s - 1804.76s |  We've got to fix this, it's a thing.
1804.76s - 1806.20s |  Whether you believe in it or not,
1806.20s - 1808.24s |  this is one of the solutions that should be happening
1808.24s - 1809.88s |  and is going to happen.
1809.88s - 1813.24s |  We do have adversarial entities in the supply chain.
1813.92s - 1814.96s |  We need to somehow fix that also,
1814.96s - 1816.84s |  but we have technology solutions that we can do.
1816.84s - 1818.88s |  We just need a number of policy changes
1818.88s - 1822.48s |  for us to be able to do the technology pieces that we have.
1822.48s - 1825.76s |  We can fix it, but we've got to actually do the things
1825.76s - 1828.00s |  and actually start doing the installations the right way
1828.00s - 1830.52s |  and do the connections the right way for future.
1830.52s - 1833.68s |  But that's my summary for today.
1833.68s - 1836.40s |  Thank you for listening and if there's any questions,
1836.40s - 1837.34s |  I don't know if I have time,
1837.34s - 1839.40s |  but I can answer at the end as well.
