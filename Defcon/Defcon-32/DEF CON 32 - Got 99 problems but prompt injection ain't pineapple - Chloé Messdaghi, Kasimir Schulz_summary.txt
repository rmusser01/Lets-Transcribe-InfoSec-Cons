**Introduction to AI Vulnerabilities**
- Ethical and secure disclosure of AI vulnerabilities is crucial.
- Challenges include biases, misinformation, data bias exploitation, and model manipulation.
- Aim is to balance transparency with security in AI disclosure processes.

**AI Vulnerability Types**
- **Data Poisoning Attacks**: Malicious actors manipulate data to bias model behavior.
- **Model Evasion Attacks**: Inference attacks that exploit AI models to extract sensitive information.
- **Model Theft Attacks**: Adversaries aim to mislead and steal AI models, leading to intellectual property theft.
- **Prompt Injection**: Security filters in generative AI can be bypassed, leading to restricted actions.
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Exploit trust by compromising trusted vendors, spreading malicious components.

**Challenges in AI Vulnerability Disclosure**
- Lack of established frameworks and well-defined protocols in AI.
- Issues with response time and determining severity of vulnerabilities.
- Difficulty in payouts due to undefined severity scoring.

**Bug Bounty and Reporting Challenges**
- Ongoing issues with hallucination submissions and biases.
- Difficulty in determining payouts due to lack of severity scoring.
- Need for clear communication and education for researchers.

**AI Framework Vulnerabilities**
- Vulnerabilities in AI development frameworks due to lack of security scrutiny.
- Issues with serialization formats like Pickle, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Path traversal vulnerabilities still prevalent in AI infrastructure components.

**Open Source and Collaboration Issues**
- Open source nature of AI presents verification challenges.
- Inconsistent code quality, hidden vulnerabilities, and complex licensing issues.
- Need for better collaboration and standardization in vulnerability management.

**Call to Action**
- Encouragement for community involvement in improving AI vulnerability reporting.
- Importance of strong partnerships and better standardization in AI security practices.
