**Introduction:**
- **Speakers**: Hyo Jin Lee and Hanryeol Park, researchers at GN, the XIOT Security Convergence Company.

**Dash Cam Market Overview:**
- **Market Size**: The global dash cam market was valued at $4.03 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 9.6% from 2024 to 2030.
- **Vendors**: Mobidian, Blackview, Nextbase, and HL Mando.
- **Technology Advancement**: Modern dash cams use networks for connectivity and dedicated apps for control, contributing to market growth but also introducing new security threats.

**Analysis Agenda:**
- **Dash Cam Features**: Formula downloads, cloud services, and open ports vary by dash cam type (Korean, Chinese, and built-in).
- **Connectivity**: Three types of dash cam connectivity: Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, phone hotspot, and cloud communication.
- **Analysis Method**: Obtaining firmware, extracting the file system, port scanning, analyzing boot logic, and debugging the main binary.

**Firmware Acquisition:**
- **Methods**: Downloading from the official website, using debugging ports (UART, JTAG), accessing the shell, and extracting from APK files.
- **Results**: Firmware obtained for all devices, none of which was encrypted.

**Port Scanning:**
- **Well-Known Open Ports**: FTP, telnet, DNS, HTTP, RPC, and RTSP.

**Boot Logic Analysis:**
- **Files Analyzed**: etc-init-daemon, etc-rc-local, and system daemon configuration files.
- **Scripts Executed**: All files starting with 'S' in etc-init-daemon.

**Main Binary Debugging:**
- **Tools**: GDB and BusyBox stored on an SD card.
- **Vulnerable Functions Tracked**: system, beopen, string copy, get, and scanf.
- **Visualization and Analysis Tool**: gIoT.
- **Challenges**: Bypassing the watchdog timer, which detects system unresponsiveness and triggers a reboot.
- **Solutions**: Executing a function to stop the watchdog, interrupting the boot script, and modifying boot arguments.

**Protocol Analysis:**
- **Custom Protocols**: Six out of nine analyzed devices used custom protocols.
- **Web Interfaces**: Four devices.
- **Cloud Services**: Two devices.
- **Encrypted Communication**: One device.
- **Custom Protocol Formats**: HEX and JSON formats, with variations in command number, packet length, and parameters.

**Zero-Day Scenarios:**
- **SD Card Usage**: Shell script execution vulnerabilities.
- **RTSP Protocol for Live View**: Stack Overflow vulnerabilities.
- **Wi-Fi, ADAS, GPS, and Other Settings**: OS command injection vulnerabilities.
- **App and Dash Cam Communication via Custom Protocols**: Improper authentication vulnerabilities.

**Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) Findings:**
- **Types of CWEs Discovered**: Eight.

**Recommendations and Future Work:**
- **Remove Script Execution Code**: From the SD card path used for developer testing.
- **Enhance Communication Security**: Implement authentication and verification processes.
- **Input Validation**: Thoroughly validate input for special characters and length values.

**Conclusion:**
- **Awareness and Safety**: Emphasizing the importance of secure dash cam products for consumer safety.
