**DEF CON 32 Presentation**

**Presenters**:
- Elonka Dunin and Klaus Schmeh
- Klaus Schmeh: German computer scientist, crypto and crypto history expert

**Encrypted Newspaper Ads in the 19th Century**:
- Popular for communication between lovers and business purposes 
- The Times published over 50 encrypted ads between 1850 and 1855

**Richard Collinson and the Franklin Expedition**:
- Richard Collinson's mission in the Canadian Arctic related to the Franklin expedition 
- Franklin expedition: British naval mission led by Lord John Franklin in 1845 to find the Northwest Passage

**Collinson's Communication System**:
- Family used a cipher based on a Royal Navy signal-book to send encrypted ads
- Ads meant for Collinson while he was at sea

**Breakthrough in Decryption**:
- 1990s: Ads decrypted by John Rapson using the Marriott Signal Code
- The codebook: Replaced words with number sequences

**Decryption Project**:
- Ongoing effort to decrypt all 55 Collinson advertisements
- Involvement of the American Cryptogram Association and individual member Taylor Leach

**Findings from Decrypted Messages**:
- Most messages contained family news and gossip
- Mentioned geographic locations relevant to Franklin and Collinson expeditions

**Significant Individuals and Events**:
- Julia de Winton: Collinson's sister, novelist, likely involved in creating ads
- Important historical events mentioned, e.g., Queen Victoria opening Newcastle station

**Challenges and Speculations**:
- Ambiguities in decryption, e.g., dual meanings of words
- Speculation about unpublished codebooks and the role of different family members in the communication system

**Conclusion**:
- Collinson's encrypted ad system considered the first known secure global communication system
- Research into complete decryption of messages is ongoing, aiming for publication in Cryptologia

**Q&A Highlights**:
- Encrypted messages were likely used to keep family stories private
- Challenges in sourcing historical codebooks
- Artificial intelligence not yet heavily influencing historical cipher breaking but has potential

**Future Efforts**:
- Continued research and decryption efforts
- Invitation for more contributions to the project
