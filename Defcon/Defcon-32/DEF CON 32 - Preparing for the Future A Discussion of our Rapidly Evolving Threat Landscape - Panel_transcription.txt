 Hello! Hello! I can't see anybody from these lights, but I'm sensing you're out there.
8.96s - 13.92s |  I'm sensing the mood, the vibes are good. Well, welcome everybody to our panel. My name is Rachel,
13.92s - 20.80s |  I'm the organizer of IoT Village, and we put together a little panel on threat landscapes, AI,
20.80s - 26.24s |  chat, GPT, all that jazz. So I'm going to let the panelists introduce themselves real quick,
26.24s - 34.59s |  and then we'll jump into the questions. Go for it. All right. Hello, I'm Steve McGregory,
34.59s - 42.75s |  I'm the director of cybersecurity R&D at Keysight. We build products that help people test
42.75s - 49.39s |  their network security, their devices, make assessments of their devices. I've been doing
49.39s - 57.95s |  security and R&D for since about 91. I spent the 90s running internet service provider
57.95s - 64.83s |  businesses, got hacked, and decided in 2000 to really spend my time doing cybersecurity. I
64.83s - 70.27s |  built an intrusion prevention system at a tipping point, and then moved into testing.
70.75s - 80.03s |  I've been doing that since, so nice to meet you. So Jamie Hardy. So I product manage now
80.75s - 86.03s |  adversary management at Intuit. I've been from fintech to semiconductor,
88.11s - 94.51s |  back to fintech, all over the board. And yeah, I'm super excited to be here.
95.23s - 101.95s |  I actually broke out of engineering to product management when I took over IoT security at
101.95s - 107.55s |  Qualcomm. So that's a blast. And I have a lot of insights from back in the day,
107.55s - 114.43s |  like about five years ago from IoT, and expanding that with cloud security. So super fun space.
114.59s - 119.63s |  Super fun space. Your mic's dead. You want to maybe try Steve's?
122.11s - 128.91s |  You got it. Can you hear me now? Oh, shit. Sorry. Part of my French.
130.91s - 142.99s |  No. Hello. Hello. Hello. Oh, we're good now. Yes. Cool. So again, Jamie Hardy. Cool.
143.07s - 150.67s |  Product manager, Intuit. Where are we at? So been fintech, semiconductor, government,
150.67s - 157.87s |  back to fintech. Branched out of engineering when I took over IoT security for Qualcomm.
158.59s - 163.07s |  Loving everything at Intuit now. Got lots of stories to tell, lots of fun times to have,
163.07s - 169.87s |  and super pumped to be here with these guys. And super excited to partner with IoT Village,
169.87s - 175.39s |  because I love what you guys are doing about, like, bridging the gap with people who need to,
175.39s - 181.31s |  like, outside in their daily day-to-day, being able to apply stuff. Love it.
185.94s - 191.06s |  Hi, I'm Ted Harrington. I'm one of the partners at Independent Security
191.06s - 199.30s |  Evaluators, and we founded and run IoT Village. I wrote a book called Hackable,
199.30s - 203.86s |  how to do application security right. Kind of talks about the things that we see from the front
203.86s - 206.74s |  lines of ethical hacking. I think the ideas would resonate with a lot of people in this room.
207.46s - 211.86s |  And I'm just here to learn from these guys, and to make sure that Rachel looks good while
211.86s - 216.02s |  protecting her eyes. Those are my sunglasses. I buy your book.
218.42s - 224.42s |  First question. How should IoT companies be thinking about the intersection of AI,
224.42s - 227.54s |  security, and IoT? Steve, you want to start that one?
228.10s - 236.82s |  Is this, is it working? Yeah. All right. Well, I think IoT security, IoT vendors,
236.82s - 244.26s |  or people using IoT devices have to probably be very concerned that if you go back and look at
244.26s - 250.26s |  something like Mirai, the botnet that took over all the IoT devices, they're kind of weak.
250.26s - 259.62s |  So I think using tools like AI, you can probably, the adversaries can very easily put together
259.62s - 266.82s |  automated attack tools and go after it and make Mirai look minuscule, potentially, right?
266.82s - 273.38s |  So I think, you know, we've got to take it and build security into the product. You know,
273.38s - 278.82s |  starting with our efforts to build IoT devices, make them more secure. Otherwise, we're
279.30s - 283.38s |  just leaving ourselves even more vulnerable in the face of AI.
286.98s - 292.58s |  Jamie? So, okay. So many things I want to say.
292.58s - 297.14s |  I guess coming back to the world of IoT, the number one thing I want to say is it's all
297.14s - 301.78s |  ingrained in the hardware root of trust, right? And I want to keep coming back to that. But
302.42s - 308.82s |  if I think about Gen AI, AI, ML, all this, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah that everyone talks
308.82s - 316.02s |  about, like, yeah, we are using it to be smarter. I mean, hell, I use chat GPT every day to write
316.02s - 321.62s |  whatever language I need. I mean, everybody does. And everybody uses that to write code
321.62s - 327.70s |  every single day, right? And the adversaries are using it against us just like we're using it to
327.70s - 334.34s |  defense against them. And it's whether it's IoT, cloud security, it doesn't matter. It's the same
334.34s - 343.78s |  game. And it's quite frankly scary because it's creating them to be faster and they're creating
343.78s - 351.06s |  malicious businesses off, you know, literally. I mean, quite frankly, there's sorry.
352.90s - 355.38s |  My bad. There are adversaries out
355.38s - 362.50s |  there literally, you know, running their books in QuickBooks, right? I mean, it's a scary thing.
364.98s - 371.78s |  I agree. Yeah. What I think is interesting about what you're talking about is how,
373.86s - 379.06s |  like, every emerging tech, I think this is true. That there's some new tech comes around and we're
379.06s - 382.66s |  like, everything's different now. And it's like, well, no, not really. Like the fundamental
382.66s - 386.58s |  principles of how we secure systems, how systems get exploited, those are the same. And the
386.58s - 391.62s |  implementation of the tech is different. And what you were talking about with, you know,
391.62s - 398.02s |  makes the adversary faster. But it also makes us faster, too. One thing I think that is different
398.90s - 403.62s |  about just we're dead. We're dead. Hello. It's going great. It wasn't me.
411.62s - 419.74s |  Hello. Okay. Well, we can still hear us if we're talking without microphones. I can't see a damn
419.74s - 427.90s |  person. But if you can hear us, we're happy to chat. We should be bringing a megaphone.
428.46s - 438.66s |  Yeah, seriously. Bring it in closer. You want some real stories that we shouldn't talk about?
438.66s - 445.46s |  Let's talk about that. Bring that shit closer. Under the verbal NDA. You all agree. Cool. We're
445.46s - 450.58s |  there. They're all dead. Yeah, every single one's dead. They're all dead. Yeah, that shit's dead.
450.58s - 458.98s |  Heard a click. Yeah, it died. Someone did not like a bit of it. Yeah. Yeah. They were like,
458.98s - 468.74s |  that's it. Well, on that note, great panel. Yeah. Good first question. We almost got through one.
468.74s - 473.87s |  Almost got through one question. Somebody take a picture.
481.15s - 483.63s |  Yeah. I mean, I would take a picture of them, but again, I can't see them.
484.27s - 487.87s |  There's people out there. I swear. There are people out there.
489.95s - 496.51s |  By them, I mean, I can see like the first two or three rows. Maybe. I see you and you.
497.23s - 500.67s |  Walk around and do it. Yeah. Maybe just go out into the hallway.
502.99s - 509.07s |  Yeah. Fuck it. Let's do that. All right, guys, we're going to come to you.
509.87s - 511.31s |  We're just going to get off the stage and come to you.
519.90s - 520.46s |  Totally not.
522.70s - 528.14s |  It is on. Well, first of all, thank you guys for just going with the flow on that. That was
528.14s - 536.46s |  very hacker-ish of everyone. Just adapt. Sorry, go ahead. I was letting you roll with it. This is
536.46s - 542.62s |  my nap time. Here we go. Another question for us. That was cool.
550.78s - 552.94s |  If you got a question, come on. Oh, and it's gone again.
553.82s - 560.30s |  It's it's gone again. Is it going again? Hello? No, this works. Jamie's in charge now.
561.18s - 563.02s |  All right, I'm in charge. Who's got a question?
567.82s - 572.22s |  There was an attack surface question. Should we go that direction? I couldn't hear what you're
572.22s - 578.54s |  saying. Actually, I didn't catch your name, but you want to come up here and maybe expand on that?
579.02s - 588.22s |  Ask the question. He's like, no, he's like, no. Maybe perhaps friend. No. All right. Does anyone
588.22s - 594.78s |  have any questions they want to ask? I got like three minutes left. I mean, the whole thing is
594.78s - 603.26s |  about how adversaries expand on attack surface management. Right. So we are using AI and all
603.26s - 610.14s |  these tools to expand on how we expand discovery. Right. And I can tell you, and I just feels like
610.14s - 614.54s |  a super hot mic from like port scanning, discovery and all these things. Right.
615.82s - 621.74s |  We can get more predictive in terms of where adversaries are going. Right. Every port we
621.74s - 631.02s |  discover, we can tell like 10 more. Right. But how do we provide the best practices for
631.98s - 638.06s |  the midsize small businesses that, you know, here's the thing. You got big enterprise companies
638.06s - 643.42s |  like us, and we got teams of people who know what they're doing. But then you got Joe Schmo,
643.42s - 649.34s |  who's got no dedicated engineers, no dedicated tools, and nobody probably in this audience
649.34s - 655.74s |  whatsoever, and they should be hiring. And so how do you help them? Yeah. That's my question.
656.06s - 662.78s |  That's my question back to you guys. I love that. How do you help the small company? How do you help
662.78s - 669.42s |  the company that's got 20 to 100 employees and no dedicated security tooling and no dedicated
669.42s - 675.26s |  security people? You and me and you all know how we do this. How do you solve that problem?
677.26s - 683.18s |  All I'll say, I will say is that 10 years ago, I was given a, I was speaking at AT&T
683.82s - 691.34s |  and, and I did a stat and it, it, the recommendation was one security researcher
691.34s - 697.66s |  or a person engineer per 100 employees or something like that. And realistically,
697.66s - 703.82s |  it was nowhere ever close to that. You know, you'd have 100 or 200 employee and you have an IT guy
703.82s - 708.46s |  that also does security, right? One guy for that company. And you have a thousand employees, you
708.46s - 712.94s |  may have two of those guys or something like that. Right. That was the stats that were coming up.
712.94s - 720.22s |  So that's where, where I'm going with this though, is in my hope is that AI, ML and AI are meant to
720.22s - 727.18s |  process large amounts of data and do things autonomously, which should help that case,
727.18s - 733.58s |  right? If you can, if you can budget tools that can help accelerate the one or two people,
733.58s - 738.46s |  right? Theoretically, this is, this is a good thing. And whether or not it's actually
739.18s - 745.90s |  being achieved right now, I mean, I can't answer, but that's, I mean, my, in short is that I'm
745.90s - 753.02s |  hoping AI is probably, it should be an answer for this problem that we deal with, with low, you know.
753.02s - 757.34s |  Yeah. I love that. Like when you think about security questionnaires, right? Who here has to
757.34s - 762.14s |  deal with those, right? Those are fun. Whether you're issuing them and then having to like
762.14s - 766.38s |  comb through all the results and say, is this a red flag or not? Or you're having to respond
766.38s - 770.30s |  to tons of them, to all the companies you want to do business with. I think that's a great
770.30s - 775.42s |  example of where AI and ML is going to significantly reduce person power because
775.42s - 778.54s |  it's going to be able to say like, okay, we understand the types of questions. Here's our
778.54s - 784.22s |  prepared answers. It can, it's going to be, that is a, a bright future. And it's not that far away.
784.22s - 793.98s |  I think we're, so, I mean, I mean all the mics, Jesus, I mean, why can't we build that into an AI
793.98s - 799.58s |  chatbot? Jamie, we're at time. Oh, we are. All right. I know. What a bummer. Ask some questions.
800.30s - 806.22s |  Super smart responses. Thank you all. There you go. Thanks everybody. Sorry this was so chaotic.
806.22s - 811.42s |  We'll, we'll hang out after, outside for anyone who wants to ask questions one-on-one. Thank you.
