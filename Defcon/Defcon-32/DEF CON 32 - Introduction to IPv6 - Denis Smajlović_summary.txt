**Introduction to IPv6**

- **IPv4 vs. IPv6**:
  - The majority of the Internet operates on **IPv4**, a legacy protocol.
  - Many engineers, particularly in security, lack knowledge about **IPv6**.
  - **IPv6** is seen as complex, leading to a preference for the familiar **IPv4**.

- **Challenges with IPv4**:
  - **IPv4** has evolved with extensions and technologies like **NAT** that deviate from its original intent.
  - Understanding **IPv6** requires revisiting the basics of **IPv4**.

**Understanding IPv4**

- **IP Address Basics**:
  - An **IPv4 address** consists of 4 fields, each ranging from 0 to 255.
  - **Subnet masks** help determine packet routing within a network.
  - **CIDR Notation** simplifies the representation of IP addresses and subnet masks.

- **Network Limitations**:
  - Home networks often use a **subnet mask** of 255.255.255.0, limiting connections to 254 devices.
  - Larger networks require more complex addressing and planning.

**Transition to IPv6**

- **IPv4 Address Exhaustion**:
  - **IPv4** addresses are nearly exhausted due to inefficient allocation and increased demand.
  - Entities like the **USDOD** and companies hold large blocks of addresses.
  - **IPv6** offers a solution with a vastly larger address space.

- **IPv6 Address Structure**:
  - **IPv6 addresses** are 128 bits, providing an exponentially larger pool of addresses.
  - Addresses are represented in hexadecimal and divided into eight 16-bit fields.

**Features of IPv6**

- **Address Configuration**:
  - **Stateless Address Auto-Configuration** allows devices to self-configure addresses using the **EUI-64** format.
  - **Privacy Extensions** prevent tracking by changing the host portion of an address over time.

- **Benefits**:
  - **IPv6** supports a virtually unlimited number of devices per network.
  - Simplifies network design and reduces the need for address conservation.

**Practical Use of IPv6**

- **Address Notation**:
  - **IPv6 addresses** can be abbreviated using double colons (::) to represent consecutive zeros.
  - When entering **IPv6 addresses** in web browsers, enclose them in square brackets to avoid conflicts with port numbers.

- **Future of IPv6**:
  - The **IPv6 landscape** is organized and efficient, unlike the fragmented **IPv4** space.
  - Current allocations represent only a small fraction of the potential **IPv6** space, ensuring long-term availability.
