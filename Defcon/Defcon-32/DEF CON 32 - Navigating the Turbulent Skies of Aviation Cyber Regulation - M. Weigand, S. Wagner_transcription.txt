 Hey everybody, thank you so much for coming.
2.44s - 6.08s |  Welcome to Flying Blind, where we're gonna talk about
6.08s - 8.76s |  aviation policy, we're gonna share some lessons learned
8.76s - 11.64s |  from our experience in the Air Force
11.64s - 15.00s |  and in civil aviation, everything from Capitol Hill
15.00s - 18.72s |  to actually hacking some fighter jets today.
18.72s - 20.68s |  So thank you, my name's Michael Wiggins
20.68s - 22.08s |  and I'm joined today by.
22.08s - 24.12s |  Hey, I'm Stuart Wagner.
24.12s - 26.46s |  Just a little bit of background on ourselves.
26.46s - 28.94s |  I am a reformed Army officer
29.00s - 30.72s |  and recovering entrepreneur.
30.72s - 34.00s |  I served in the Army as one of the first cyber officers
34.00s - 36.24s |  and then I decided I wanted to start a company
36.24s - 38.96s |  so that we could bring hardware and software solutions
38.96s - 41.84s |  to the market to help protect aircraft
41.84s - 44.04s |  because they don't have antivirus and stuff on it.
44.04s - 45.64s |  It seemed like a good idea at the time
45.64s - 48.04s |  and we grew it pretty tremendously,
48.04s - 50.80s |  but along the way I realized that there was
50.80s - 52.74s |  a lot of policy and law that needed to change
52.74s - 54.64s |  to make the market possible and so real excited
54.64s - 56.96s |  to share with you what I've learned.
56.96s - 58.22s |  Stuart?
58.24s - 60.08s |  Sure, so I'm Stuart.
60.08s - 63.24s |  I was a software developer at Microsoft
63.24s - 67.46s |  focused on data engineering, like telemetry systems,
67.46s - 70.88s |  so data off of operating systems,
70.88s - 72.72s |  data off of cloud services,
72.72s - 76.00s |  then came over to the DOD and eventually ending up
76.00s - 79.44s |  in the Air Force as the Chief Digital Transformation Officer
79.44s - 82.36s |  where we basically tried to learn and adapt
82.36s - 84.64s |  from data off of weapon systems.
84.64s - 87.36s |  So Mike asked me to kind of share
87.36s - 88.46s |  some of the things we've learned
88.46s - 90.42s |  and how that might apply to cybersecurity.
90.42s - 91.94s |  So really excited to give this talk
91.94s - 97.13s |  and hopefully jump into some questions.
97.13s - 99.29s |  All right, so today we're just gonna
99.29s - 101.53s |  give a really quick overview of at least
101.53s - 103.45s |  my personal thoughts on the state of affairs
103.45s - 106.69s |  of cybersecurity and civil aviation
106.69s - 108.81s |  and we'll touch a little bit on where we are
108.81s - 110.11s |  like securing weapon systems,
110.11s - 113.01s |  which is important for their deterrence mission.
113.01s - 116.73s |  Talk about some of the recent developments in regulations.
116.75s - 119.99s |  We just got the FAA Reauthorization Act,
119.99s - 121.43s |  which is passed every four years
121.43s - 122.79s |  that just got signed into law.
122.79s - 125.59s |  So we'll touch on some of the exciting developments
125.59s - 128.51s |  in that law that hopefully is gonna help advance safety
128.51s - 130.31s |  and security interests.
130.31s - 132.79s |  Stuart's gonna share some lessons from the Air Force
132.79s - 135.87s |  where he actually led a series of hackathons
135.87s - 137.27s |  against fighter jets.
137.27s - 139.71s |  And then we're gonna talk about how data
139.71s - 143.97s |  and instrumentation from those defense experiments,
144.11s - 149.11s |  what lessons there may exist for civil aviation.
149.87s - 153.11s |  Then we'll have an open discussion about policy next steps.
153.11s - 154.55s |  And I'm gonna try and convince you
154.55s - 157.07s |  that everybody in this room can actually
157.07s - 159.39s |  have a voice in that conversation.
162.26s - 165.70s |  So without further ado, really kind of excited
165.70s - 168.06s |  to share that this year, every four years,
168.06s - 169.72s |  the FAA gets reauthorized.
169.72s - 171.50s |  So we don't have air traffic controllers
171.50s - 174.14s |  without actually Congress passing a law
174.16s - 177.24s |  to pay these people to help us make sure
177.24s - 179.38s |  that we can all fly home safely.
179.38s - 180.92s |  That's a good thing.
180.92s - 183.60s |  It's also a chance for us to kind of update the way
183.60s - 187.08s |  that the entire aviation industry does business.
187.08s - 189.68s |  And there's all kinds of important
189.68s - 191.60s |  and sometimes special interest components
191.60s - 193.86s |  that get into that legislation.
193.86s - 198.86s |  There's a subsection in it in section 360 something
199.10s - 201.78s |  that talks about cybersecurity.
201.78s - 204.88s |  And the crazy thing about where we are today
204.88s - 207.24s |  is that most aircraft continue
207.24s - 209.68s |  to be increasingly interconnected,
209.68s - 212.88s |  increasingly fly-by-wire, computer and software dependent,
212.88s - 215.44s |  but there is no flying commercial aircraft today
215.44s - 218.52s |  with a running antivirus intrusion detection
218.52s - 220.32s |  or intrusion prevention system.
220.32s - 223.00s |  In fact, do we have any pilots in the room?
223.00s - 224.96s |  Just by show of hands, we have a handful.
224.96s - 227.18s |  I'm a pilot too, I'm a private pilot.
227.18s - 229.62s |  There's no such thing as a crew indication,
229.62s - 232.92s |  any type of warning, caution or advisory light to the crew
232.92s - 234.64s |  to let them know that like,
234.64s - 236.44s |  hey, something really fishy is going on
236.44s - 238.36s |  and maybe don't take off.
238.36s - 240.76s |  Maybe you have like, you know,
240.76s - 243.88s |  an indication of malicious messages on the data bus
243.88s - 247.76s |  or your firmware or software is like bad.
247.76s - 250.40s |  And unfortunately we use in industry
250.40s - 253.44s |  really solid flight worthy technology,
253.44s - 255.64s |  which means it's often really old.
255.64s - 258.52s |  And because of that conveniences
258.74s - 261.02s |  that we all take for granted or security technologies
261.02s - 263.14s |  that we take for granted with like our mobile devices
263.14s - 265.18s |  where all of the software delivery
265.18s - 266.86s |  is cryptographically signed
266.86s - 269.58s |  and there's some pretty good supply chain
270.54s - 274.80s |  and delivery processes, a lot of that doesn't exist.
274.80s - 276.38s |  And the first rule of, you know,
276.38s - 278.66s |  one of the principal rules of cybersecurity obviously
278.66s - 281.50s |  is if you have physical access to an aircraft,
281.50s - 284.02s |  you can compromise or to a computer, you can compromise it.
284.02s - 286.42s |  Well, a lot of our commercial jets,
286.42s - 288.26s |  they fly all over the planet
289.00s - 291.40s |  and there's a variety of people that have physical access
291.40s - 292.80s |  even to the avionics.
292.80s - 295.88s |  So all of these things kind of taken for granted,
295.88s - 298.92s |  I like make me a little bit uncomfortable.
298.92s - 301.84s |  Unfortunately, we don't have a really good example
301.84s - 303.96s |  of a plane being hacked out of the sky, thank God.
303.96s - 306.24s |  But the idea obviously is to stay ahead of that.
306.24s - 308.92s |  We don't want to react to safety events.
308.92s - 311.52s |  And unfortunately, I will make an aggressive statement
311.52s - 315.16s |  and say that many significant evolutions
315.18s - 316.90s |  in aviation and safety policy
316.90s - 318.94s |  have been driven by fatalities.
318.94s - 322.42s |  And so, you know, part of our mission in life, if you will,
322.42s - 325.56s |  has been to try and flip that paradigm.
325.56s - 327.78s |  And I really appreciate everybody being here today
327.78s - 331.16s |  because I know that that resonates with folks at DEF CON.
331.16s - 334.58s |  So in the FAA Reauthorization Act this year,
334.58s - 338.06s |  I got most excited about the fact that
338.06s - 341.10s |  Congress directed the administrator
341.10s - 342.10s |  and therefore the FAA
342.10s - 344.58s |  to change the type certification process
344.64s - 346.76s |  and make sure that cybersecurity
346.76s - 349.42s |  and continuous monitoring of avionics
349.42s - 352.32s |  is now a requirement for any new aircraft design
352.32s - 353.96s |  that gets approved.
353.96s - 356.10s |  Previously, it was like a suggestion,
356.10s - 357.58s |  but this time around,
357.58s - 359.68s |  it was a requirement that they must do it.
360.56s - 362.52s |  There are a whole bunch of other problems though
362.52s - 363.92s |  that have to be solved.
363.92s - 368.12s |  And they also provided a little bit through like study,
368.12s - 371.12s |  we're gonna help identify and make the case that
371.12s - 374.48s |  you need better people through a GAO report and study.
375.38s - 376.22s |  Do you have the right people?
376.22s - 377.04s |  Do you have the right funding?
377.04s - 377.98s |  Do you have the right structures?
377.98s - 379.78s |  Is there the right kind of committee
379.78s - 381.86s |  to make sure that voices from industry,
381.86s - 386.10s |  the OEMs, the airlines, operators, unions,
386.10s - 388.66s |  technologists are all heard as the rules
388.66s - 392.50s |  on how all of this gets implemented actually happen.
392.50s - 394.66s |  So all of that was in the legislation this year.
394.66s - 396.04s |  And over the next couple of years,
396.04s - 397.22s |  we're gonna see that implemented.
397.22s - 400.30s |  And hopefully by the end of this decade,
400.30s - 402.62s |  we will actually see airliners come out
402.64s - 406.08s |  with real onboard continuous monitoring of their avionics,
406.08s - 408.72s |  which sounds like a good idea to me.
408.72s - 410.88s |  So just as a state of affairs,
410.88s - 412.96s |  the situation if I were to put it really bluntly
412.96s - 416.84s |  is it's kind of not great as it is today,
416.84s - 417.80s |  but it's gonna get better.
417.80s - 419.92s |  And unfortunately, the legislation
419.92s - 423.04s |  is coming along quite quickly.
423.04s - 425.88s |  Actually hats off to our European colleagues.
425.88s - 428.62s |  If we have anybody that flew across the pond,
428.62s - 431.04s |  YASA has been moving exceptionally fast
431.06s - 433.62s |  in actually implementing regulations.
433.62s - 436.74s |  And so this is great that kind of the two major
436.74s - 439.54s |  aviation regulators that set the standard
439.54s - 443.26s |  for what rules look like in building
443.26s - 446.58s |  and flying and maintaining aircraft and airlines
446.58s - 448.30s |  are largely getting on the same page
448.30s - 451.18s |  and moving quickly to adapt all of this.
451.18s - 454.06s |  So those are some of those recent developments
454.06s - 458.10s |  and state of affairs, but I wanna turn over to Stewart
458.10s - 460.02s |  because he has a really interesting perspective
460.04s - 461.92s |  from industry and then within the Air Force
461.92s - 466.51s |  that I think informs the policy discussion.
466.51s - 468.19s |  Thanks, Mike, appreciate it.
468.19s - 469.95s |  Okay, so number one, first of all,
469.95s - 472.23s |  these slides that I'm gonna show you now,
473.23s - 474.91s |  I created them while I was in the Air Force,
474.91s - 478.71s |  so I need to cite myself and release them publicly.
478.71s - 481.35s |  And so I can show you these today, which is cool.
482.31s - 487.31s |  All right, so basically when I got to the Air Force,
487.47s - 489.83s |  what we were trying to do in terms of,
489.83s - 491.23s |  they call it digital transformation.
491.73s - 492.57s |  I don't know if it means anything,
492.57s - 494.45s |  but basically what we were trying to do,
494.45s - 497.57s |  I took it to mean learning from data
497.57s - 500.73s |  off of operational systems like telemetry data.
500.73s - 505.17s |  And this is kind of what I used to try to make the case
505.17s - 507.41s |  to like generals and senior leaders,
507.41s - 510.85s |  senior civilians in the DoD to learn and adapt
510.85s - 513.29s |  from data off of operational systems.
513.29s - 517.29s |  And in the Air Force, this is like bits off jets,
517.29s - 520.61s |  bits off munitions, bits off any type
520.95s - 524.91s |  of operational system, but a lot of bits off of jets.
524.91s - 528.39s |  But in the DoD, this could be bits off of really ships,
528.39s - 530.07s |  submarines, et cetera.
530.07s - 532.39s |  And so we were trying to figure out how do we like
532.39s - 535.09s |  encourage and demonstrate the potential of this data,
535.09s - 536.95s |  which could be used for cyber stuff.
536.95s - 539.15s |  A lot of times hackathons are confused for cyber.
539.15s - 542.47s |  They can be cyber, but they also can do other things too.
542.47s - 545.55s |  I come from more of a capability development side.
545.55s - 548.03s |  So what we were trying to do is basically emphasize
548.21s - 550.65s |  and demonstrate the potential of this.
550.65s - 552.77s |  It starts with kind of this story here,
552.77s - 555.41s |  which my background coming from Microsoft,
555.41s - 557.17s |  we did this, I worked on health of systems
557.17s - 558.73s |  or reliability data.
558.73s - 561.19s |  Every time there's a crash on a Windows device,
561.19s - 562.25s |  log data is produced.
562.25s - 565.77s |  That log data in many cases is actually sent back
565.77s - 568.25s |  to kind of home station to be analyzed,
568.25s - 570.01s |  to understand like the health of the system, right?
570.01s - 572.13s |  And I can, we can talk about that more
572.13s - 573.37s |  if people have specific questions,
573.91s - 578.19s |  but basically you can learn from various beta builds
578.19s - 581.07s |  that are released and you can learn basically
581.07s - 583.71s |  what you want to fix and what will basically solve
583.71s - 584.55s |  the biggest problem.
584.55s - 586.15s |  And that was what we kind of focused on.
586.15s - 588.19s |  But like, there's all these other cases
588.19s - 592.11s |  where big tech, my argument here is basically
592.11s - 594.23s |  every big tech company in the world
594.23s - 597.47s |  undergirds with automatically collected data.
597.47s - 599.27s |  You call it telemetry, you can call it whatever you want,
599.27s - 601.59s |  but it's automatically collected data for their systems.
601.59s - 602.47s |  And there's all these examples.
602.47s - 604.45s |  I won't go through each one.
604.45s - 608.09s |  Tesla, of course, is AI automation,
608.09s - 610.53s |  is what you see SpaceX, electronic resilience,
610.53s - 612.45s |  so the Starlink example.
612.45s - 613.81s |  A lot of people like to focus on the fact
613.81s - 615.57s |  that there was a software patch pushed
615.57s - 618.49s |  to mitigate basically jamming.
618.49s - 620.49s |  But the thing that's kind of underrepresented
620.49s - 622.61s |  is like how did they know what to fix?
622.61s - 624.05s |  How did they know what was being jammed
624.05s - 625.09s |  and how to fix it, right?
625.09s - 627.85s |  And the automatic collection of data is critical for that.
627.85s - 628.97s |  And et cetera, et cetera.
628.97s - 631.97s |  I'll key in on Google as well.
632.31s - 633.99s |  A lot of people think of the search engine
633.99s - 635.71s |  and PageRank and other AI algorithms
635.71s - 636.83s |  which automatically collect data.
636.83s - 639.47s |  But what I actually am really fascinated by
639.47s - 642.95s |  is their unplanned, basically crowdsourced learning
642.95s - 646.35s |  with flu data, so Google Trends actually,
646.35s - 648.67s |  if you're familiar, was able to actually out-predict
648.67s - 650.53s |  the CDC for the spread of flu
650.53s - 652.31s |  basically by the use of search terms.
652.31s - 654.49s |  So there's all this richness in data
654.49s - 656.39s |  when automatically collected that's really valuable
656.39s - 658.47s |  and we were trying to emphasize that
658.47s - 661.87s |  to the DOD and to the Air Force.
662.57s - 663.41s |  There's basically like four ways
663.41s - 665.73s |  we think about learning from data
666.63s - 668.77s |  that's collected off of operational systems
668.77s - 670.69s |  and I'll just point to that green box
670.69s - 672.09s |  that's most relevant to this talk
672.09s - 675.07s |  which is basically you can adapt the system itself.
675.07s - 677.13s |  So adapt like the operational system.
677.13s - 680.49s |  You can also adapt the tactics, techniques, and procedures.
680.49s - 682.37s |  So how you use the system.
682.37s - 683.85s |  You can adapt kind of strategy
683.85s - 685.97s |  which probably is less critical.
685.97s - 688.45s |  It could be useful with the FAA, I would think.
688.45s - 690.25s |  And then actually you can adapt the way
690.27s - 692.43s |  you actually exercise and train with data.
692.43s - 693.79s |  All right, okay.
693.79s - 698.39s |  And so how did we go about basically learning
698.39s - 700.71s |  and adapting from data in the Air Force?
700.71s - 704.71s |  And so I'll give you kind of a hypothetical example
704.71s - 706.31s |  that I've illustrated here and then I'm gonna kind of
706.31s - 709.43s |  generalize it to the DOD and it may also generalize now
709.43s - 711.83s |  to the FAA and commercial flight.
711.83s - 716.07s |  So the basic idea is like in the examples I gave
716.07s - 718.07s |  with big tech, you basically have data,
718.07s - 719.75s |  you collect, you do something with it,
720.25s - 721.81s |  and then you ultimately find a way to like put it
721.81s - 725.65s |  into a production-like environment or a test environment
725.65s - 728.17s |  and trial effects with it of some kind
728.17s - 730.45s |  and then ultimately collect on that to improve it.
730.45s - 733.01s |  And that's your kind of typical iteration pipeline.
733.01s - 735.13s |  They call that like DevOps, right?
735.13s - 737.65s |  In the Air Force, it's a little bit harder
737.65s - 740.09s |  because we have to deal with things like classification.
740.09s - 742.05s |  We may have like degraded comms.
742.05s - 743.55s |  It's not as simple as just sending bits
743.55s - 745.01s |  over an internet connection.
745.01s - 748.07s |  And so it starts with, and this is example again,
748.09s - 750.33s |  I would use this to pitch to senior leaders.
750.33s - 753.43s |  The idea is basically a mission captures some information
753.43s - 756.29s |  so we fly some sort of jet that may or may not
756.29s - 759.09s |  collect on a neutral or adversarial
759.09s - 761.85s |  or friendly system of some kind
761.85s - 764.13s |  and you produce bits during that process.
764.13s - 766.37s |  That sensor data needs to get like shared
766.37s - 769.01s |  to some human or machine that can do something with it
769.01s - 771.69s |  so you gotta get it off the operational system, right?
771.69s - 774.01s |  And then you need to, this is like a critical difference
774.01s - 776.33s |  in the DOD is like you need to classify the data
776.35s - 778.51s |  so you need to know like what is the classification
778.51s - 779.33s |  of the data?
779.33s - 780.31s |  It could be secret, it could be top secret,
780.31s - 782.71s |  it could be unclassified, it could be lots of things.
782.71s - 784.87s |  There's a lot we can go into on that too,
784.87s - 786.19s |  especially when you combine data.
786.19s - 789.59s |  Sometimes it's up classes, which is complicated.
789.59s - 792.39s |  So if you wanna learn, sometimes you have to learn
792.39s - 793.99s |  at higher classifications.
793.99s - 797.65s |  And then basically you need to get that to like doers
797.65s - 799.85s |  or machines that can learn from that data.
799.85s - 801.55s |  So that could be analytics, that fourth box
801.55s - 804.67s |  with too many words in it is doers doing stuff with data
804.67s - 805.99s |  and it could be machines or humans trying
806.65s - 808.81s |  to build stuff in a permissive environment
808.81s - 810.53s |  where you can basically do stuff, right?
810.53s - 814.21s |  And then you wanna field those solutions in some way
814.21s - 816.89s |  or employ them in some way that produce new data
816.89s - 818.97s |  that allows you to restart this process, right?
818.97s - 821.97s |  And so what we kind of call this in the DOD
821.97s - 823.33s |  is like we call this bits to effect.
823.33s - 825.29s |  They're focused on effects, but you could think of those
825.29s - 827.37s |  as just being changes to a system.
827.37s - 829.61s |  And so the idea, and this is how it generalizes.
829.61s - 832.61s |  So basically, fundamentally those steps generalize
832.61s - 833.59s |  in this format.
833.59s - 835.95s |  Number one, you need to instrument and collect data.
836.77s - 837.97s |  If you have no instrumentation off the system,
837.97s - 841.09s |  you do not produce a change or effect based on data
841.09s - 843.33s |  because the data never existed in the first place.
843.33s - 845.57s |  There were no bits to collect.
846.81s - 849.65s |  Once you have collection of those bits on the system,
849.65s - 851.37s |  you need to get them off the system.
851.37s - 853.97s |  If you're going to try to generalize learning
853.97s - 857.97s |  across a system and not just to that specific device, right?
857.97s - 860.01s |  And so piping and data engineering,
861.33s - 864.17s |  that's important I think in operational systems
864.17s - 867.29s |  that are disconnected, such as like aircraft.
868.27s - 870.29s |  The next is probably less relevant,
870.29s - 872.59s |  but potentially relevant is like data classification
872.59s - 873.43s |  and access.
873.43s - 876.31s |  So certain data is gonna be like restricted or protected.
876.31s - 880.43s |  You need to figure out like what is that restricted portion
880.43s - 884.73s |  and what to do with it.
884.73s - 888.15s |  I'll give one example that I think about
888.15s - 892.41s |  and it may be relevant also in general aviation as well,
892.43s - 896.75s |  which is basically even if the device you're collecting from
896.75s - 900.75s |  is not of some sophisticated protected
900.75s - 902.79s |  or classified origin,
902.79s - 906.47s |  if it has the ability to collect things near it
906.47s - 909.61s |  that are highly classified or protected,
909.61s - 911.35s |  then the data that's collected
911.35s - 914.11s |  then is classified at that level.
914.11s - 916.31s |  So we might fly something like say an F-16
916.31s - 917.99s |  next to something maybe more classified,
917.99s - 920.51s |  like say, I don't know, an F-22 or something, right?
921.17s - 923.37s |  That data would become much more classified
923.37s - 926.49s |  because it collected near something of high importance.
926.49s - 928.53s |  And so, yeah, I could imagine some examples
928.53s - 930.89s |  in civil aviation where that could take place.
930.89s - 933.05s |  The next is the ability to do stuff with the data.
933.05s - 934.57s |  So you need to be able to bring that data
934.57s - 936.85s |  into an environment where you can try and do stuff.
936.85s - 939.69s |  And so what we did is we actually like produced
939.69s - 941.49s |  these really permissive environments
941.49s - 943.77s |  that isolated the protected data
943.77s - 945.57s |  and allowed people to do stuff with it.
945.57s - 946.41s |  Then you employ the effects
946.41s - 948.13s |  and that's how it kind of generalizes.
948.13s - 950.19s |  Okay, back to you.
950.57s - 954.03s |  So anytime I hear classification,
954.03s - 957.93s |  I see a lot of my civil colleagues roll their eyes.
957.93s - 959.61s |  I just think we have the exact same thing.
959.61s - 961.01s |  We just call it proprietary data
961.01s - 963.11s |  and different versions of that.
963.11s - 965.13s |  There's actually a lot of generalizations
965.13s - 967.13s |  between those two problem sets.
968.05s - 973.05s |  I want to just throw out a couple thoughts and perspectives.
973.61s - 976.97s |  Number one, I hear a lot of companies in aerospace say,
976.97s - 979.95s |  hey, we're already collecting like more data off of systems
979.97s - 981.53s |  than we know what to do with.
981.53s - 983.81s |  And I think that that's actually a fallacy.
983.81s - 986.41s |  I think that we can do a significantly better job
986.41s - 990.29s |  actually instrumenting, especially fly-by-wire assets
990.29s - 993.65s |  and must do that for safety, reliability,
993.65s - 994.53s |  it's really good business
994.53s - 997.09s |  or an economic efficiency reasons to do that.
997.09s - 1002.05s |  But the order of magnitude data problem
1002.05s - 1004.57s |  that a lot of people complain about,
1004.57s - 1005.93s |  like what would we do with all of this?
1005.93s - 1007.89s |  It's expensive to collect and record all of that.
1008.87s - 1011.75s |  I think that folks in aerospace that say that
1011.75s - 1013.87s |  don't really appreciate how other industries
1013.87s - 1014.83s |  have solved that problem
1014.83s - 1017.27s |  and how important and useful that data is.
1017.27s - 1022.27s |  That data also, I am worried about how collected aviation
1022.99s - 1026.27s |  aggregated or desensitized data
1026.27s - 1028.15s |  makes its way into the policy process
1028.15s - 1030.71s |  because I actually don't see a lot of examples of that.
1030.71s - 1033.87s |  I think that there are tremendous data silos in industry.
1033.87s - 1037.11s |  You have operators that have data insights,
1037.13s - 1038.61s |  OEMs that have data insights.
1038.61s - 1041.35s |  Those two often do not share appropriately.
1041.35s - 1043.21s |  And then almost the last people
1043.21s - 1045.55s |  to kind of get high level insights,
1045.55s - 1049.13s |  knowledge out of that are regulatory bodies.
1049.13s - 1050.79s |  And so breaking down those silos,
1050.79s - 1053.61s |  I think actually has a tremendous impact on safety
1053.61s - 1055.47s |  and the security conversation.
1056.61s - 1059.69s |  So the whole data, what the Air Force calls an OODA loop,
1059.69s - 1060.83s |  it's a learning cycle.
1061.93s - 1063.61s |  In civil aviation,
1063.73s - 1067.51s |  there's a real significant policy problem,
1067.51s - 1071.03s |  which is that we've learned over time to build safe systems.
1071.87s - 1074.75s |  We have really strict software development,
1074.75s - 1076.95s |  testing and approval processes
1076.95s - 1078.79s |  to make sure that an aircraft
1078.79s - 1081.19s |  and the software on it is safe to fly.
1081.19s - 1083.53s |  And we wanna reduce that risk as much as possible.
1083.53s - 1085.87s |  But that means that it takes a lot of time
1085.87s - 1088.43s |  and a lot of money in order to make changes
1088.43s - 1090.31s |  to important software systems.
1090.31s - 1092.23s |  There's a talk at 12 that's gonna dive
1092.23s - 1095.21s |  into all the nuance there,
1095.21s - 1097.01s |  different design assurance levels.
1097.01s - 1099.17s |  Like you obviously are gonna put more attention
1099.17s - 1101.79s |  to things that are what they call DAL-A,
1101.79s - 1103.73s |  the most important computers on board a plane,
1103.73s - 1105.29s |  as opposed to the things that don't matter
1105.29s - 1107.03s |  or not safety critical.
1107.03s - 1109.91s |  But this is directly at odds with a patching process,
1109.91s - 1111.87s |  which fundamentally does not exist.
1111.87s - 1113.59s |  So from a policy perspective,
1114.43s - 1116.11s |  really nobody has figured out yet
1116.11s - 1121.11s |  if you identify a zero day on an avionics computer,
1121.27s - 1124.85s |  that is really important for the function of that aircraft.
1124.85s - 1129.85s |  How do you quickly spin a fix and then propagate that
1130.11s - 1133.07s |  without either grounding the fleet in the interim
1133.07s - 1135.41s |  or just ignoring that problem,
1135.41s - 1136.63s |  working on it in the background,
1136.63s - 1139.43s |  letting everybody probably not even know
1139.43s - 1140.63s |  that there's a potential risk
1140.63s - 1142.71s |  and then rolling out a software update
1142.71s - 1143.55s |  once it goes through
1143.55s - 1146.23s |  the normal software development process.
1146.23s - 1150.25s |  And there's different DO, 178, 360, et cetera.
1150.25s - 1153.97s |  So that's really interesting
1153.97s - 1157.69s |  that we have both safety and a lack of security processes,
1157.69s - 1161.21s |  but adapting existing IT security processes
1161.21s - 1163.97s |  such as patching will come into direct conflict
1163.97s - 1166.33s |  with the way that we build, certify, test
1166.33s - 1167.77s |  and deliver software today.
1168.97s - 1172.61s |  The instrumentation and data kind of loop
1172.61s - 1175.97s |  and the time horizons there all intersect.
1175.97s - 1178.33s |  And back to the legislation,
1179.17s - 1183.81s |  there's now a committee that's gonna be stood up
1183.81s - 1185.57s |  to try and grapple with these issues.
1185.57s - 1188.09s |  And the way that we can all get involved
1188.09s - 1192.13s |  is that there's a request for comment
1192.13s - 1194.53s |  in a process that many of us are familiar with.
1194.53s - 1196.21s |  A lot of people underutilize that
1196.21s - 1198.29s |  or when they do comment and candidly,
1198.29s - 1203.29s |  a lot of the comments are not offering solutions
1203.41s - 1204.81s |  or not really technically rich.
1204.81s - 1206.41s |  Like if you have thoughts and opinions
1206.41s - 1210.09s |  on how these processes or how specific technology
1210.09s - 1213.65s |  should be implemented, it is fascinating to me
1213.65s - 1216.13s |  to have seen examples of how individual comments
1216.13s - 1218.49s |  get bubbled up and actually like discussed
1218.49s - 1220.93s |  in the committees that actually set the rules
1220.93s - 1224.65s |  and the regulations for how this law is implemented
1224.65s - 1226.57s |  and how safety technologies actually get rolled out.
1226.57s - 1229.25s |  So I would encourage everybody to actually check that out.
1229.25s - 1232.69s |  If you see a component of this problem, that's interesting
1232.69s - 1235.25s |  and you wanna get that voice out there.
1236.01s - 1237.69s |  There's both kind of a government-sponsored
1237.69s - 1240.29s |  and an industry-sponsored side to this world.
1240.29s - 1243.57s |  And so for those that are unaware,
1243.57s - 1247.37s |  there's a set of committees run by an organization
1247.37s - 1250.89s |  called RTCA that essentially builds all of this.
1250.89s - 1253.61s |  It usually has representation from government
1253.61s - 1256.01s |  but mostly industry-focused.
1256.01s - 1259.33s |  And these two things intersect at higher policy levels
1259.33s - 1262.65s |  but it's really important to kind of interface with both.
1262.69s - 1265.73s |  So we, just looking at the clock,
1265.73s - 1267.97s |  actually wanted to reserve a bunch of time
1267.97s - 1270.29s |  with all of this background for questions.
1271.17s - 1272.93s |  I know that we have a lot of experience in the audience.
1272.93s - 1276.89s |  So I think we will, we're just gonna ask Stuart
1276.89s - 1279.21s |  if you wanna talk about hackathons
1279.21s - 1282.55s |  and I wanna preface the Air Force,
1284.05s - 1287.29s |  your component here that I'm really excited
1287.29s - 1289.77s |  to have seen the Aviation Village at DEF CON.
1290.77s - 1292.37s |  Are we out of, are we looking?
1293.65s - 1296.65s |  Oh, get out, are you serious?
1296.65s - 1297.77s |  All right, well, we won't hold you that long.
1297.77s - 1299.33s |  We'll give you some time.
1299.33s - 1302.45s |  But really excited to see how the Aviation Village
1302.45s - 1303.93s |  has evolved over the last couple of years
1303.93s - 1305.85s |  and that major manufacturers are showing up
1305.85s - 1306.79s |  and participating.
1308.01s - 1313.01s |  However, there still is, I think, a lot of work to be done
1314.37s - 1318.25s |  in terms of looking at pen testing, building processes
1318.25s - 1320.69s |  and providing protections for security researchers
1320.69s - 1324.65s |  to do more work, especially on core avionic elements
1324.65s - 1326.41s |  where you can't buy this stuff on eBay.
1326.41s - 1328.45s |  So there's first like an access problem.
1328.45s - 1330.29s |  How do you get access to the tech?
1330.29s - 1333.65s |  Second, a lot of the work that's been done
1333.65s - 1337.69s |  in the IT industry when it comes to bug bounties
1337.69s - 1339.43s |  and reporting processes and protections
1339.43s - 1341.57s |  for security researchers needs to kind of be ported
1341.57s - 1342.77s |  over to aviation.
1342.77s - 1344.89s |  And the Air Force has done some really cool stuff here
1344.89s - 1347.53s |  with the Bravo program.
1347.53s - 1349.49s |  So Stuart, can you talk a little bit about
1349.49s - 1351.81s |  how you stood that up and how it resulted
1351.81s - 1353.53s |  and what civil aviation can learn?
1354.57s - 1355.41s |  Yeah, sure.
1355.41s - 1359.29s |  So it's kind of, it's not so different from,
1359.29s - 1360.57s |  and it's an honor to be here at DEF CON.
1360.57s - 1363.59s |  I've been an admirer, but this is my first time here.
1364.89s - 1367.73s |  But basically what we did is we started
1367.73s - 1371.01s |  with this premise as described of what can we do
1371.01s - 1373.69s |  with kind of recorded operational data?
1373.69s - 1375.89s |  And similar to the Aviation Village here,
1375.89s - 1377.77s |  we basically started running events
1377.77s - 1380.29s |  where like engineers from within DOD,
1380.29s - 1382.81s |  so these are civilian and military personnel,
1382.81s - 1386.93s |  as well as, and actually there was a talk given earlier,
1387.77s - 1391.65s |  the DOD lawyer versus open source software developer,
1391.65s - 1394.25s |  Rebecca Lively ran that, I think on Friday,
1394.25s - 1396.29s |  and really enjoyed that talks.
1396.29s - 1397.95s |  And I think that was inspired in part
1397.95s - 1399.01s |  by one of these events.
1399.01s - 1401.17s |  But basically we ran about 10 of these events,
1401.17s - 1404.31s |  ranging in size from around 50, 75 people
1404.31s - 1407.07s |  to actually 700, which is pretty large.
1407.07s - 1411.07s |  These were classified and protected events,
1411.07s - 1412.43s |  but actually any American citizen
1412.43s - 1415.47s |  for a number of these events was able to participate.
1415.47s - 1418.17s |  So like anybody here who's an American citizen
1418.17s - 1420.67s |  could have applied and participated.
1420.67s - 1424.91s |  We ended up producing about 200 software prototypes
1424.91s - 1428.79s |  from real operational data, which is very unusual at DOD.
1428.79s - 1432.31s |  Oftentimes the prototypes are produced without the data.
1432.31s - 1434.15s |  What did we kind of learn from this?
1434.99s - 1435.83s |  I'd say a couple of things.
1435.83s - 1436.65s |  So number one, we found that within
1436.65s - 1437.75s |  the Department of Defense,
1437.75s - 1440.27s |  there's actually a massive set of talent.
1440.27s - 1444.79s |  Just like when your number N is so large,
1444.79s - 1447.19s |  DOD, I think, I mean, I know Air Force
1447.19s - 1448.71s |  has around two million employees,
1448.71s - 1449.99s |  I don't know the size of DOD,
1449.99s - 1451.71s |  but it's probably around three X that.
1451.71s - 1453.65s |  When your N is sufficiently large,
1453.65s - 1456.99s |  you just have tinkerers, engineers,
1456.99s - 1461.71s |  people who just wanna go play with different systems.
1461.71s - 1464.31s |  And so we were able to kind of create that opportunity
1464.31s - 1468.39s |  across these 10 events and do so as well as international.
1468.39s - 1471.21s |  We ran one in Europe, in Germany.
1471.21s - 1474.55s |  We ran one in the Indo-PACOM region in Hawaii.
1474.55s - 1477.81s |  We ran one in coordination with CENTCOM,
1478.75s - 1480.35s |  which they publicly disclosed
1480.35s - 1483.47s |  was on counter unmanned aerial systems.
1483.47s - 1485.43s |  And so we were able to do some pretty cool
1485.43s - 1487.55s |  and interesting things and like inspire a lot of people
1487.55s - 1488.91s |  just like DEFCON does every year.
1488.91s - 1491.39s |  And so I think we took some inspiration from DEFCON
1492.39s - 1494.79s |  and we're able to kind of produce projects,
1494.79s - 1497.07s |  some of which we're able to enter
1497.07s - 1498.55s |  kind of production within DOD
1498.55s - 1499.79s |  and actually make some impact,
1499.79s - 1503.27s |  some of which I can't even talk about here, but yeah.
1503.27s - 1507.23s |  And then the last slide I'll cover real quick.
1507.23s - 1510.15s |  So those were all kind of like events that we organized,
1510.15s - 1512.19s |  but there's so much more happening
1512.19s - 1516.63s |  in terms of kind of these events
1516.63s - 1518.23s |  where people gather together
1518.23s - 1520.63s |  to kind of learn and adapt from data office systems
1520.67s - 1524.51s |  or do engage in cyber testing and penetration testing.
1524.51s - 1526.31s |  And so these are some of those things
1526.31s - 1527.57s |  that have come out of this.
1527.57s - 1529.43s |  And it's important to note that like this is occurring
1529.43s - 1530.87s |  definitely in the United States
1530.87s - 1534.57s |  and with other democratic allies and things like that.
1534.57s - 1537.43s |  There was a national security hackathon in El Segundo.
1537.43s - 1539.69s |  There was one in Stanford.
1541.15s - 1543.91s |  There's been venture capital involved.
1543.91s - 1545.83s |  There's been kind of just citizens
1545.83s - 1547.91s |  wanting to do this as well.
1547.91s - 1552.07s |  In Ukraine, you have the anti-Shaheed hackathon
1552.07s - 1552.91s |  that took place,
1552.91s - 1555.27s |  focused on basically defending their interests.
1555.27s - 1556.67s |  And then you've also got,
1556.67s - 1558.75s |  of course this is taking place
1558.75s - 1562.59s |  in some kind of, some would say adversarial countries,
1562.59s - 1565.85s |  to democratic republics such as in Russia and China
1565.85s - 1567.63s |  where they're also using these activities.
1567.63s - 1570.11s |  So this is occurring kind of everywhere
1570.11s - 1573.83s |  and we're seeing various ways in which it's being employed.
1573.83s - 1575.67s |  And I can talk more about that in the questions,
1575.67s - 1577.11s |  but Mike, back to you.
1578.03s - 1580.67s |  Yeah, so crazy, crazy policy ideas.
1580.67s - 1583.43s |  One, it would be really cool to see the FAA
1583.43s - 1585.71s |  actually run and sponsor some hackathons
1585.71s - 1588.47s |  and also for industry to open their doors
1588.47s - 1592.15s |  and make some of the most kind of exclusive
1592.15s - 1596.71s |  avionics components that are on many of the planes
1596.71s - 1599.79s |  that provide the most seat carrying capacity.
1599.79s - 1603.07s |  So therefore like the highest impact systems,
1603.07s - 1607.27s |  it'd be really cool to see more of that made available
1607.35s - 1609.63s |  for the community to mess with.
1610.47s - 1614.03s |  We have to figure out a patching process, second.
1614.03s - 1616.71s |  And we have to figure out how we're gonna balance
1616.71s - 1621.51s |  speed with safety and software review.
1621.51s - 1623.31s |  That's really tough not to crack,
1623.31s - 1627.19s |  but I think that there are really important lessons
1627.19s - 1628.03s |  to learn.
1628.03s - 1630.87s |  We don't want to move so fast that you have
1631.91s - 1634.19s |  the ability for somebody to make a mistake
1634.19s - 1635.75s |  like CrowdStrike did the other day.
1635.75s - 1640.47s |  But at the same time, we have to quickly address
1640.47s - 1643.47s |  emerging threats and new discoveries
1643.47s - 1646.39s |  and do so on like a smaller time horizon
1646.39s - 1648.87s |  than the 12 or 18 months that it typically takes
1648.87s - 1652.83s |  to rush through a DAL-A software change
1652.83s - 1655.91s |  to a major component and actually get that proliferated.
1655.91s - 1658.31s |  We also have to figure out somehow
1658.31s - 1660.87s |  what the policy and economic frameworks are
1660.87s - 1663.75s |  that support that to make a more inclusive
1663.75s - 1665.63s |  kind of environment to make all that possible.
1666.63s - 1669.39s |  We would love to get some feedback from the audience
1669.39s - 1672.07s |  and answer any questions or engage in discussion.
1672.07s - 1677.07s |  So with that, we'll just pause there and see.
1677.15s - 1679.51s |  I will start by posing a question to you guys.
1679.51s - 1682.35s |  Which of these crazy ideas that we've thrown out
1682.35s - 1685.07s |  or any of the insights here has really resonated
1685.07s - 1687.19s |  or you think is a terrible idea?
1688.95s - 1689.79s |  Sir.
1745.64s - 1746.52s |  Great question.
1746.52s - 1748.52s |  The first thing that comes to mind is
1749.32s - 1752.40s |  as a technologist, telemetry and real-time monitoring
1752.40s - 1754.48s |  sounds like a phenomenal idea.
1754.48s - 1757.40s |  And I wanna acknowledge as a pilot
1757.40s - 1758.84s |  the first concern that comes to mind,
1758.84s - 1761.56s |  which is like, wait, are they gonna instrument
1761.56s - 1763.60s |  and know every single time
1763.60s - 1765.64s |  that I don't make an absolutely perfect touchdown?
1765.64s - 1768.20s |  And then is my job gonna be potentially at risk
1768.20s - 1770.24s |  if I'm on the back half of that curve?
1770.24s - 1772.44s |  So that's like the first thing that I wanna share
1772.44s - 1774.36s |  that actually came to mind.
1774.36s - 1776.48s |  To your point, sorry, could you just restate
1776.48s - 1808.16s |  very concisely the final question that you asked?
1808.16s - 1809.44s |  Evolving to, yeah.
1809.44s - 1811.64s |  Okay, so my thoughts on this
1811.64s - 1815.12s |  from a crew alerting perspective.
1815.12s - 1819.36s |  Just really, really quick to bring us all up to speed.
1820.52s - 1821.92s |  I think it's really important to acknowledge
1821.92s - 1824.80s |  that one of the fundamental and most important things
1824.80s - 1827.32s |  that a crew does obviously is decision-making
1827.32s - 1830.76s |  and you want to preserve the pilot's ability
1830.76s - 1833.28s |  to make decisions.
1833.36s - 1836.80s |  There is a balance in terms of the amount of information
1836.80s - 1837.76s |  that you give a pilot
1837.76s - 1841.04s |  because all pilots are trained to manage
1841.04s - 1842.76s |  basically their attention, their workload,
1842.76s - 1844.16s |  they call this crew load.
1844.16s - 1847.36s |  And when you overload cognitively the crew,
1847.36s - 1850.00s |  the same thing happens like in a sock
1850.00s - 1852.20s |  when you just throw so many alerts,
1852.20s - 1854.80s |  you can kind of paralyze and affect the ability
1854.80s - 1856.44s |  for them to accomplish their job.
1856.44s - 1858.52s |  So there's a bunch of disciplines
1858.52s - 1862.28s |  that come into this question and figuring out
1862.28s - 1865.44s |  what do you share with the crew for what purpose,
1865.44s - 1868.48s |  when, where and why and how you do so.
1868.48s - 1870.04s |  There are human factors,
1870.04s - 1872.96s |  there's like design UI UX elements to that,
1872.96s - 1875.72s |  there's process, there's training implications.
1875.72s - 1878.44s |  And it's actually a really, really difficult,
1880.48s - 1882.28s |  I think question to answer.
1882.28s - 1884.36s |  So I don't know that anybody has that figured out
1884.36s - 1885.56s |  first thing I want to say is like,
1885.56s - 1886.72s |  I'm not going to have an answer to that,
1886.72s - 1888.80s |  but I feel really strongly as a pilot
1888.80s - 1893.12s |  that I would like to know before I go wheels up
1893.12s - 1897.60s |  on the runway that I have a safe configuration
1897.60s - 1901.32s |  of hardware and software on the plane first and foremost,
1901.32s - 1903.40s |  because the situation is different
1903.40s - 1905.08s |  when you are weight on wheels,
1905.08s - 1907.60s |  you're on the ground as opposed to in flight.
1907.60s - 1912.60s |  If I lose a system, I need to understand very quickly
1912.80s - 1915.28s |  what other systems I can rely on
1915.28s - 1918.48s |  to fly, navigate or communicate the plane.
1919.60s - 1923.28s |  Pilots get indications, warnings, cautions and advisories
1923.28s - 1926.16s |  to do that in the event of systems losses,
1926.16s - 1929.28s |  but we don't train or inform pilots to think today
1929.28s - 1932.64s |  about the implications of either malicious software
1932.64s - 1934.28s |  or software glitches or failures.
1934.28s - 1936.60s |  I think the closest thing that comes to that
1937.92s - 1942.44s |  relatably is like somebody didn't update logs on a plane
1942.44s - 1944.20s |  and now I have like out of date charts
1944.20s - 1945.88s |  or an out of date navigation database
1945.88s - 1946.72s |  or something like that,
1946.72s - 1949.56s |  and I can't do a specific type of procedure.
1949.56s - 1952.44s |  I think that there is a component of training
1952.44s - 1955.64s |  where we want pilots to understand
1955.64s - 1959.92s |  that systems can be impacted in certain ways
1959.92s - 1962.36s |  and it informs the way that they think
1962.36s - 1964.96s |  about using redundant systems
1964.96s - 1968.24s |  or more analog capabilities to perform functions.
1968.24s - 1971.68s |  And I think some type of indication in the cockpit
1971.68s - 1973.68s |  is important while we continue to advance
1974.08s - 1977.60s |  the state of art of actually securing the technology itself.
1979.04s - 1981.52s |  I don't know if that's a satisfying answer for you,
1981.52s - 1983.96s |  but I see a head shaking.
2001.01s - 2001.85s |  Yeah.
2004.09s - 2007.05s |  Well, I don't think that we did, please, please.
2007.05s - 2010.17s |  And also is real time a requirement
2010.17s - 2012.17s |  or is it just getting all of the data
2012.17s - 2014.81s |  and being able to protect a system at scale
2014.81s - 2017.41s |  maybe with some delays in that data collection,
2017.41s - 2019.57s |  the requirement, what are the drawbacks?
2019.57s - 2022.73s |  Yeah, in my experience, basically the use of data
2022.73s - 2024.33s |  basically is most effective when you need
2024.33s - 2026.65s |  to make calibrations or changes to a system.
2026.65s - 2028.33s |  So if everything's working great,
2029.21s - 2031.25s |  I mean like it may be able to improve workflows,
2031.25s - 2032.85s |  it may be able to improve the preciseness
2032.85s - 2033.85s |  or accuracy of your work,
2033.85s - 2036.85s |  but fundamentally if things are going great
2036.85s - 2037.73s |  and you have no problem,
2037.73s - 2039.77s |  then the data's not really important.
2039.77s - 2041.77s |  The data becomes most useful under courses
2041.77s - 2045.29s |  of basically need for calibration or change
2045.29s - 2046.65s |  in current operating flows.
2046.65s - 2048.41s |  So like for example, I could imagine
2048.41s - 2051.53s |  if maybe there's a massive storm
2051.53s - 2053.73s |  that requires basically a bunch of planes
2053.73s - 2056.61s |  to land unexpectedly in different places,
2056.61s - 2058.93s |  potentially the collection of data could inform
2058.93s - 2060.57s |  or improve on decision making there.
2060.57s - 2063.17s |  So that kind of translates to in the DoD world,
2063.17s - 2064.81s |  we call that command and control, right?
2064.81s - 2067.01s |  So some sort of centralized control
2067.01s - 2068.13s |  or decentralized control,
2068.13s - 2069.81s |  the collection of data under that circumstance
2069.81s - 2071.25s |  would be useful.
2071.25s - 2074.21s |  On the plane itself, I can think of a example
2074.21s - 2076.45s |  which I'm gonna be intentionally a little bit vague about,
2077.13s - 2080.25s |  but basically if you were to lose, say,
2081.89s - 2086.33s |  a sensor system that has multiple sensors
2086.33s - 2088.29s |  and you were to lose, say, one of them,
2089.61s - 2092.05s |  you could potentially rely on those others
2092.05s - 2094.53s |  which may like to basically infer,
2094.53s - 2099.53s |  to inference or predict what that missing sensor would see.
2100.93s - 2103.17s |  And so under certain circumstances, that could be useful.
2103.17s - 2104.41s |  So there's ways to basically produce
2104.41s - 2107.17s |  some sort of emergent capability
2107.17s - 2111.49s |  or extract some signal from other systems that are lost
2111.49s - 2113.09s |  that are generally not relied on
2113.09s - 2115.77s |  under general normal operating conditions.
2115.77s - 2118.37s |  And so those are some ways in which we've found
2118.37s - 2121.53s |  the use of data off an operational system
2121.53s - 2126.37s |  to be really valuable under mission, like DoD mission.
2126.37s - 2128.37s |  It may translate to civil aviation.
2128.37s - 2129.85s |  Does that sort of answer your question?
2129.85s - 2133.01s |  Give you some examples?
2133.01s - 2134.09s |  Okay.
2134.29s - 2135.13s |  I'll just add,
2137.41s - 2142.41s |  I think that streaming real-time data is great,
2142.41s - 2145.81s |  but there's a need to get all of the data
2145.81s - 2147.61s |  and it doesn't necessarily happen
2149.13s - 2149.97s |  when the plane is flying.
2149.97s - 2151.13s |  And when I say all of the data,
2151.13s - 2153.29s |  I'm thinking like full take data collection
2154.57s - 2157.57s |  off the onboard avionics networks, right?
2157.57s - 2161.77s |  So hearing 664, MIL-STD-1553,
2161.77s - 2163.93s |  the inner LRU communications
2164.77s - 2167.81s |  because if you were to think a little bit differently
2167.81s - 2170.29s |  about the aircraft, that data allows you
2170.29s - 2173.05s |  to treat each aircraft as a sensing system.
2173.05s - 2175.69s |  And any data scientists will tell you
2175.69s - 2177.53s |  that the more data that they have,
2177.53s - 2179.93s |  obviously the better that they can train predictive,
2179.93s - 2182.13s |  maintenance models, the better that you can train
2182.13s - 2186.17s |  and identify potential predictive indicators of threats,
2186.17s - 2189.49s |  especially as certain adversaries in some cases
2189.49s - 2190.93s |  have demonstrated over and over again,
2190.93s - 2195.73s |  the ability to actually test emergent capabilities.
2195.73s - 2198.81s |  Like you want to be able to identify that
2198.81s - 2201.93s |  before an entire fleet is potentially impacted.
2201.93s - 2205.77s |  So maybe this data is all collected,
2205.77s - 2209.93s |  it's cached and then it's recovered like on the ground
2209.93s - 2211.45s |  where it's less expensive to do so
2211.45s - 2213.09s |  with some near wireless means
2213.09s - 2216.97s |  as opposed to clogging up like an expensive SATCOM link.
2216.97s - 2220.41s |  But you can imagine how useful that would be
2220.41s - 2222.13s |  potentially for a security use case.
2222.13s - 2225.17s |  I think the compelling economic reason to do that
2225.17s - 2227.29s |  will certainly be like maintenance
2227.29s - 2229.69s |  and continuous evaluation of like updates
2229.69s - 2231.65s |  or feature identification initially,
2231.65s - 2234.65s |  but certainly there's a safety
2234.65s - 2236.53s |  and a security element to that
2236.53s - 2239.57s |  that I don't think is fully appreciated yet.
2239.57s - 2240.53s |  Sir.
2240.53s - 2274.27s |  So in the industry, is this problem going to get worse?
2274.27s - 2277.35s |  Is this something, are there mitigations in place
2277.35s - 2278.19s |  that are gonna stop this?
2279.60s - 2281.64s |  I mean, kind of a crude example is
2281.64s - 2284.04s |  if I see my level of pressure indicated about this,
2284.04s - 2285.40s |  is that because my sensor failed
2285.40s - 2287.16s |  or is that because the gravity's spinning things
2287.16s - 2289.32s |  are gonna stop the way gravity spins?
2289.32s - 2291.32s |  So that's a situation where an indicator
2291.32s - 2294.60s |  is going to all of a sudden become much worse situation.
2294.60s - 2296.64s |  So to me, I think that's probably,
2296.64s - 2298.16s |  and we're a long ways from that.
2298.16s - 2299.80s |  We're gonna have to gather a lot of this data
2299.80s - 2303.28s |  to learn that we can now begin to identify
2303.28s - 2305.52s |  this problem is not contained.
2305.52s - 2309.24s |  This problem is going to impact more flight systems
2310.04s - 2311.44s |  and now the urgency of my decision-making
2311.44s - 2314.04s |  is gonna be a fundamentally different thing.
2314.04s - 2316.08s |  I think this is really exciting.
2316.08s - 2317.72s |  The thing that I'm just concerned about
2317.72s - 2321.16s |  is that we can't even do that on terrestrial systems
2321.16s - 2324.00s |  without, we can't even do that on enterprise systems.
2324.00s - 2326.64s |  I don't know how we're gonna do it on aircraft
2326.64s - 2330.60s |  without folding our mental image of how we handle it.
2330.60s - 2332.76s |  And maybe a fourth thing to consider too,
2332.76s - 2334.84s |  and this one's totally up for debate,
2334.84s - 2337.84s |  so contentious concepts here, but what about intent?
2339.96s - 2344.28s |  Would it impact decision-making in the cockpit
2344.28s - 2347.92s |  if you knew that systems were intentionally being affected
2347.92s - 2350.04s |  or if it was an unintended thing, right?
2350.04s - 2352.64s |  So if something was maintenance or if it was malicious.
2352.64s - 2355.16s |  So today, in the last year and a half,
2355.16s - 2356.60s |  if you've been reading the news,
2356.60s - 2358.84s |  there are thousands of flights every month
2358.84s - 2362.44s |  that are impacted with GPS spoofing and jamming.
2362.44s - 2367.44s |  And some MMRs, GPS receivers, when they get bad time
2367.72s - 2371.40s |  from like a delayed GPS signal that's spoofing,
2371.40s - 2374.80s |  it causes internal systems to fail and crash.
2374.80s - 2379.12s |  This can, if you know that that is happening intentionally
2379.12s - 2384.12s |  as opposed to just a maintenance anomaly,
2384.40s - 2386.24s |  it can impact your decision-making
2386.24s - 2390.44s |  on if you proceed, divert, whatever the case may be.
2391.36s - 2395.68s |  That's an insight that I heard from some pilots recently
2395.72s - 2397.44s |  that were sharing an example
2397.44s - 2399.08s |  where coming back from the Middle East
2399.08s - 2404.08s |  where they knew to expect some GPS interference,
2404.76s - 2409.16s |  lost some systems, but they were expecting that.
2409.16s - 2412.04s |  What they weren't expecting was that they would have to fly
2412.04s - 2414.04s |  at a lower flight level over the Atlantic,
2414.04s - 2415.40s |  and that impacted their fuel burn
2415.40s - 2417.48s |  because when you fly at higher altitudes,
2417.48s - 2420.32s |  you get different fuel burn efficiencies.
2420.32s - 2424.24s |  Well, they had not expected that,
2424.24s - 2427.80s |  and so when they reran all of their range calculations,
2427.80s - 2429.76s |  they were within safety limits
2429.76s - 2431.60s |  to make it to their final destination,
2431.60s - 2434.64s |  but had to constantly weigh and consider a divert.
2435.48s - 2437.12s |  Knowing that that was coming
2437.12s - 2439.32s |  and knowing that that was a malicious activity
2439.32s - 2443.24s |  was really impactful because they were expecting it
2443.24s - 2446.92s |  and they were able to monitor and make changes.
2446.92s - 2449.64s |  When the unexpected happens, sometimes it's useful
2449.64s - 2454.00s |  and informs your decision-making if this is malicious.
2454.40s - 2457.84s |  That's another element to the crew alert conversation
2457.84s - 2458.96s |  that's extremely nuanced,
2458.96s - 2460.96s |  and I don't think we have any questions
2460.96s - 2462.40s |  answered around that.
2462.40s - 2465.08s |  But yeah, really, really tough stuff.
2465.08s - 2467.36s |  As it relates to policy,
2467.36s - 2470.00s |  I think getting the right frameworks,
2470.00s - 2471.88s |  the right committees, and the right people in the room
2471.88s - 2475.24s |  to wrestle and grapple with these concepts
2475.24s - 2478.28s |  and see what we can learn from diverse experiences
2478.28s - 2481.88s |  is probably the best way to arrive at the best answer,
2481.88s - 2483.80s |  and that best answer's almost certainly
2483.80s - 2485.88s |  going to evolve over time
2485.88s - 2488.12s |  as threats evolve, as the technology evolves.
2489.00s - 2490.12s |  In the meantime, a lot of people
2490.12s - 2492.68s |  are just gonna be deeply unsatisfied with the status quo,
2492.68s - 2495.76s |  so fantastic.
2495.76s - 2542.37s |  Sir?
2542.37s - 2547.13s |  Did you open that up?
2547.13s - 2549.45s |  I think disclosure may be something
2549.45s - 2553.01s |  like controlling disclosure processes
2554.57s - 2556.49s |  is a potential way to mitigate some of that,
2556.49s - 2558.49s |  but I see some audience reactions.
2558.49s - 2560.93s |  Does anybody in the audience have thoughts and opinions?
2560.93s - 2561.77s |  Sir?
2561.77s - 2578.63s |  So you can see there being a lot of students
2578.63s - 2580.51s |  who would be engaged in this.
2580.51s - 2589.40s |  The thing that I understand where he's coming from,
2589.40s - 2593.36s |  obscurity fails, and it fails in the worst ways
2593.36s - 2597.88s |  because when you only rely on security by obscurity,
2597.88s - 2600.72s |  you don't inform the defenders either.
2600.72s - 2604.52s |  And so at least if we can find these bugs,
2604.52s - 2607.08s |  we don't have to worry that an adversary has found it
2607.08s - 2608.28s |  and just hasn't told anyone
2608.32s - 2610.20s |  because they're waiting for that day
2610.20s - 2613.48s |  that they're gonna, speaking of 9-11,
2613.48s - 2614.84s |  they've got all these people out there
2614.84s - 2616.40s |  ready to insert a thumb drive
2616.40s - 2619.76s |  at all of these maintenance bases across the country.
2619.76s - 2622.32s |  They don't even know why they're doing it.
2622.32s - 2625.94s |  And then that day comes and we're at war.
2625.94s - 2627.22s |  So just summarizing, right?
2627.22s - 2631.22s |  Security, obscurity, the counterpoint to research.
2631.22s - 2632.66s |  How do you control it from getting out?
2632.66s - 2634.58s |  Especially important, just to highlight,
2634.58s - 2637.18s |  I think you missed the, it's really expensive
2637.18s - 2639.54s |  and takes a long time to fix these systems.
2640.42s - 2641.90s |  To your point, yeah,
2641.90s - 2643.94s |  so these are the two battling components.
2643.94s - 2645.38s |  I saw an opinion in the back.
2645.38s - 2647.98s |  Sir, did you have something to add to that?
2647.98s - 2680.93s |  One thing I'll share is,
2680.93s - 2685.12s |  I don't know if this is working or not, it's fine.
2685.12s - 2686.68s |  Yeah, yeah.
2686.68s - 2690.72s |  One thing I noticed at least in the Air Force
2690.72s - 2693.48s |  which consists of Air Force and Space Force
2693.48s - 2696.12s |  is that basically telemetry collection
2696.12s - 2699.68s |  was natural off of space systems.
2699.68s - 2702.08s |  And the connection I made to that was because
2702.08s - 2704.32s |  they're designed, at least Space Force doesn't really,
2704.32s - 2706.84s |  as of now, send astronauts up.
2706.84s - 2709.64s |  And so those are autonomous systems.
2709.64s - 2714.64s |  And so that's probably a very good test bed for,
2715.12s - 2719.48s |  it's naturally collecting and it's naturally instrumented
2720.40s - 2722.08s |  because it has to be.
2722.08s - 2725.32s |  And it naturally also solves for that piping problem
2725.32s - 2728.48s |  because generally, not always,
2728.48s - 2729.64s |  because if you don't have the pipes,
2729.64s - 2731.32s |  then it's gonna just need to be autonomous
2731.32s - 2732.44s |  without the pipes, right?
2732.44s - 2735.24s |  So yes, we did see that.
2735.24s - 2736.68s |  One thing I thought of later,
2736.68s - 2739.20s |  I wanna try to answer your question a little bit better
2739.20s - 2740.04s |  that I thought was relevant.
2740.04s - 2741.40s |  I think it's come up a bit,
2741.40s - 2742.92s |  but may not have been emphasized
2742.92s - 2745.24s |  is the predictive maintenance piece
2745.24s - 2747.08s |  of this data for humans.
2747.08s - 2751.08s |  So in contrast to autonomous systems,
2751.08s - 2754.20s |  like while you have human lives at stake,
2754.20s - 2757.24s |  what we have seen, at least in the Air Force,
2757.24s - 2759.92s |  is that the automatic collection of this data,
2760.04s - 2763.40s |  even if harvested and leveraged later,
2763.40s - 2768.16s |  we may be able to gain insights and start to see signal
2768.16s - 2772.76s |  that certain functions of a mission system
2772.76s - 2774.92s |  are not operating at spec,
2774.92s - 2777.64s |  or maybe they are operating at spec,
2777.64s - 2780.64s |  what we thought was spec 30 years ago,
2780.64s - 2782.76s |  but maybe that spec needs to be changed.
2782.76s - 2784.96s |  So like the collection of that data
2784.96s - 2788.16s |  allows us to make these systems safer.
2788.16s - 2792.52s |  Contrasting that against the concerns of vulnerability
2792.52s - 2796.08s |  or exploitation is tough to understand.
2796.08s - 2799.48s |  It's about, I mean, the typical kind of cost calculation
2799.48s - 2804.48s |  is risk times the impact of that risk coming true, right?
2807.16s - 2811.00s |  So I don't know which one to weigh between the two,
2811.00s - 2814.60s |  but I do know that in terms of safety of systems,
2814.60s - 2815.60s |  the collection of data
2815.60s - 2818.08s |  can allow you to make those systems safer.
2818.84s - 2819.68s |  It also could save money
2819.68s - 2821.48s |  because if we don't have things breaking in the air,
2821.48s - 2823.12s |  to your point of losing oil pressure,
2823.12s - 2825.52s |  if we are able to mitigate them on the ground
2825.52s - 2828.48s |  before you fly, well, it saves people
2828.48s - 2829.92s |  and it also could save money.
2829.92s - 2831.08s |  Those are some kind of thoughts
2831.08s - 2833.04s |  that have emerged from this discussion.
2834.80s - 2836.00s |  I have an observation,
2836.00s - 2840.16s |  and that is that in the emergent eVTOL market,
2840.16s - 2842.04s |  every single one of those designs
2842.04s - 2844.04s |  that I've interacted with their design teams,
2844.04s - 2847.60s |  they are planning as a basic requirement,
2847.60s - 2849.72s |  as a basic feature of the system,
2849.72s - 2851.64s |  full take avionic data collection
2851.64s - 2853.96s |  and significant telemetry instrumentation,
2853.96s - 2857.00s |  like significantly more advanced
2857.00s - 2859.48s |  than anything that we see in manned,
2859.48s - 2862.88s |  both at the airline, GA level, et cetera.
2863.96s - 2867.20s |  They're not just doing that for tests and evaluation.
2867.20s - 2870.44s |  In DOD and in civil aviation,
2870.44s - 2872.00s |  historically how we built systems
2872.00s - 2876.16s |  is when you have a prototype test aircraft,
2876.16s - 2877.68s |  we put all these orange wire
2877.68s - 2879.40s |  and orange boxes, data collectors,
2879.40s - 2881.48s |  and we set everything up,
2881.48s - 2885.00s |  but then we rip all of that out for size weight,
2885.00s - 2887.92s |  for swap savings when things go into production.
2887.92s - 2890.08s |  And I think that those industries
2890.08s - 2890.92s |  have certainly learned,
2890.92s - 2892.88s |  hey, there's all of these unknown unknowns
2892.88s - 2894.08s |  and we just want all of the data
2894.08s - 2896.64s |  because we're convinced that it will satisfy
2896.64s - 2898.28s |  all of these needs in the future.
2898.28s - 2901.60s |  The big question I think for operators right now,
2901.60s - 2902.92s |  like airlines is,
2902.92s - 2905.56s |  is it worth retrofitting legacy fleets
2905.56s - 2908.32s |  with some type of capability to do that?
2908.32s - 2911.76s |  Is there sufficient like safety
2911.76s - 2916.56s |  and economic use case to underwrite that investment?
2916.56s - 2922.41s |  And that's some of the debate that I hear right now.
2922.41s - 2971.12s |  In the back, yes, sir.
2971.12s - 2975.96s |  So I think answering the question to GPS interference
2977.00s - 2980.28s |  is extremely system nuanced, obviously.
2981.72s - 2983.96s |  There's been an interesting trend in aviation
2983.96s - 2985.76s |  over the last 20 years
2986.56s - 2989.44s |  where any systems engineers don't hold me
2989.44s - 2991.12s |  to the strict definitions of this,
2991.12s - 2993.44s |  but you've seen increasing coupling
2993.44s - 2997.44s |  of inertial navigation to discipline that
2997.44s - 3000.68s |  with external GNSS signaling.
3000.68s - 3003.20s |  And when these systems are completely independent,
3003.20s - 3004.16s |  that's fantastic.
3004.16s - 3007.20s |  You lose one, you can roll over to the other.
3007.20s - 3009.44s |  When they are highly coupled,
3009.44s - 3012.08s |  obviously a problem with one flows into the other.
3012.08s - 3015.00s |  And so it degrades the independence
3015.52s - 3017.04s |  in the backup utility.
3017.04s - 3019.32s |  We have seen that in a number of specific designs.
3019.32s - 3020.64s |  I won't call out anybody,
3020.64s - 3023.16s |  but a lot of really smart people right now
3023.16s - 3024.88s |  are trying to implement fixes
3026.36s - 3028.04s |  and separate these systems a little bit more
3028.04s - 3029.76s |  because that seems like the natural thing.
3029.76s - 3031.52s |  There were really good reasons,
3031.52s - 3034.36s |  but I think, you know,
3034.36s - 3036.76s |  like the industry learned that,
3036.76s - 3039.92s |  boy, timing is really important
3039.92s - 3042.08s |  and there's tremendous time sensitivity
3042.08s - 3043.88s |  and synchronization on internal systems.
3043.92s - 3045.64s |  And that wasn't like properly fuzzed
3045.64s - 3047.28s |  or tested for interference
3047.28s - 3049.76s |  because nobody really assumed that GPS spoofing
3049.76s - 3053.68s |  would be such commonplace or directed against civil assets.
3053.68s - 3055.84s |  And now we know that that's probably naive.
3056.92s - 3058.88s |  So those are just some initial,
3058.88s - 3060.12s |  I think thoughts that come to mind
3060.12s - 3063.00s |  or at least perceptions from my point of view.
3063.00s - 3064.60s |  There's really good reporting out
3064.60s - 3069.60s |  on how pervasive GPS spoofing is.
3069.84s - 3072.40s |  I would say spoofing is far more impactful
3072.40s - 3075.32s |  on aviation systems in my learned experience
3075.32s - 3077.12s |  the last two years than jamming.
3077.12s - 3078.48s |  Jamming's kind of fine.
3078.48s - 3080.44s |  Like systems are actually really resilient
3080.44s - 3085.00s |  to not getting lock and not being able to provide that.
3085.00s - 3088.16s |  They're designed with all kinds of redundancies and backups.
3088.16s - 3091.08s |  It's that false data injection,
3091.08s - 3091.96s |  if you think of spoofing,
3091.96s - 3094.20s |  like within the skin of the plane
3094.20s - 3096.32s |  that maybe wasn't appropriately tested.
3098.24s - 3102.12s |  The issue is that on certain fleets that are flying today,
3102.68s - 3106.36s |  you have a subset of those
3106.36s - 3109.60s |  where you can't just drop a software or firmware fix
3109.60s - 3113.08s |  on certain LRUs to evolve this.
3113.08s - 3115.00s |  And so people are trying to figure out
3115.00s - 3117.26s |  like how do they mitigate those risks now?
3118.20s - 3120.24s |  But yeah, there's some really good reporting on this already
3120.24s - 3121.20s |  that's out in the news.
3121.20s - 3179.82s |  I think we have time for one last question, sir.
3179.82s - 3184.10s |  Yeah, I am a huge fan and fanatical advocate
3184.10s - 3185.78s |  for we need to educate pilots
3185.78s - 3188.22s |  to their software dependencies
3188.22s - 3189.94s |  so that they really pay attention
3189.94s - 3192.46s |  and understand that reverting back
3192.46s - 3196.58s |  to secondary and tertiary navigation
3196.58s - 3200.02s |  and flying processes that they're already taught,
3200.02s - 3202.02s |  like keep those skills sharp,
3202.02s - 3204.42s |  expect systems potentially to be lost
3204.42s - 3208.54s |  and put a little bit of thought to like the fact that,
3208.54s - 3213.06s |  yeah, there's a cyber dependency.
3213.34s - 3216.10s |  I think that the training conversation
3216.10s - 3218.62s |  is really gonna evolve in terms of what that means.
3218.62s - 3222.22s |  But today the practical guidance is,
3222.22s - 3224.22s |  make sure that you can use your backup
3224.22s - 3226.74s |  like analog systems to navigate and fly.
3227.90s - 3229.18s |  But what that means in the future,
3229.18s - 3231.82s |  if there's some type of cyber crew indication,
3231.82s - 3233.62s |  what emergency procedures they go to
3233.62s - 3234.62s |  and how that all evolves,
3234.62s - 3236.58s |  I'm really excited to see how that happens.
3236.58s - 3239.02s |  So we have time for one more question, sir.
3257.56s - 3259.52s |  I have not, that sounds really scary.
3261.24s - 3272.56s |  Yeah, just, I haven't, no.
3272.56s - 3274.28s |  That is very evil.
3274.28s - 3276.12s |  Thank you for giving me another reason
3276.12s - 3277.36s |  to stay up at night.
3277.36s - 3280.00s |  Stewart, any last comments before we wrap it up?
3280.00s - 3281.32s |  Hey, everybody, thank you so much.
3281.32s - 3282.92s |  Really appreciate it, take care.
