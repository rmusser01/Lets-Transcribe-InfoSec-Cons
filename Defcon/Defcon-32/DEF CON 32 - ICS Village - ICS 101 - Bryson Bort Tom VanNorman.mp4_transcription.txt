0.00s - 2.88s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 I'm Bryson Bort, I'm the founder of Scythe,
2.88s - 6.58s |  the founder of Grimm, and the co-founder of the ICS Village.
6.58s - 9.36s |  I'm Tommy Norman, co-founder of ICS Village
9.36s - 11.64s |  and a senior VP at Grimm.
11.64s - 14.24s |  So we run a village down there
14.24s - 15.60s |  on industrial control systems.
15.60s - 17.62s |  So if you wanna get some hands-on experience,
17.62s - 20.20s |  which we're gonna just quickly kind of give a high level on,
20.20s - 23.12s |  please come on down, we can fuck up shit together.
23.12s - 25.32s |  And the best part about it, since it's not production,
25.32s - 27.96s |  we all know what it's like to not test in prod, right?
27.96s - 31.38s |  You can poison a fake water supply.
32.52s - 33.36s |  Okay.
33.36s - 35.00s |  Oh, mics?
35.00s - 36.20s |  Do I need a mic?
36.20s - 38.32s |  Or is it for recording?
38.32s - 39.16s |  Yes.
40.64s - 41.58s |  It's fine.
43.56s - 46.24s |  All right, so let's talk industrial control systems.
46.24s - 48.64s |  Who knows what an industrial control system is?
49.64s - 60.85s |  What's an industrial control system?
60.85s - 65.42s |  Imagine that, what a good nerd answer.
65.42s - 67.52s |  Any computer that's at least 20 years old.
69.64s - 73.56s |  Also correct.
73.56s - 76.80s |  No, but so why is that important to understand, right?
76.80s - 79.16s |  Most of us, it's easy to learn
79.16s - 80.32s |  about information technology.
80.32s - 82.40s |  This is part of why we wanted to put this talk together
82.40s - 85.62s |  is because getting into industrial control systems
85.62s - 87.80s |  isn't just something you can walk down to Best Buy
87.80s - 92.80s |  and ask for a HMI or a DCS or any of those things.
94.00s - 94.88s |  You're not gonna be able to do it.
94.88s - 97.80s |  Now, strangely, you can buy them all on eBay.
97.80s - 99.20s |  We're gonna get to that, right?
99.20s - 102.80s |  So it's more of this like obfuscated, obtuse discipline
102.80s - 106.16s |  that it's like, I'm interested, but how do I get to it?
106.16s - 107.40s |  And so that's why, yeah, exactly.
107.40s - 108.98s |  That's why we're talking about it today.
108.98s - 111.32s |  So that joke, when we go back to industrial control systems
111.32s - 112.76s |  already sets the condition,
112.76s - 115.72s |  how it's so different than information technology, right?
115.72s - 118.74s |  You're trained to buy a phone every two years.
118.74s - 120.48s |  Your laptop has a problem.
120.48s - 122.64s |  You patch it, you buy a new one, right?
122.64s - 124.08s |  It's not expensive, it's easy to do.
124.08s - 125.68s |  You're used to doing that.
125.68s - 127.12s |  In the industrial control system environment,
127.44s - 129.64s |  these things are not built on confidentiality,
129.64s - 130.92s |  integrity, and availability,
130.92s - 134.00s |  which are the security principles you've been taught in IT.
134.00s - 137.04s |  It's built on resilience and availability
138.68s - 141.08s |  because what happens when water's not available?
142.32s - 144.56s |  You wanna give a nerd answer to that?
144.56s - 145.40s |  Bad shit.
146.56s - 148.68s |  Bad shit happens, right?
148.68s - 150.80s |  So this is a completely different world
150.80s - 152.28s |  with a completely different impact.
152.28s - 153.72s |  Here's the good news.
153.72s - 155.44s |  It's not as hard as it sounds.
156.44s - 158.80s |  So we're gonna talk through some of those pieces
158.80s - 159.64s |  and we're gonna explain,
159.64s - 162.92s |  kind of give you an idea of how the architecture works,
162.92s - 164.40s |  how threats work.
164.40s - 166.56s |  And then we're gonna talk through some specific examples
166.56s - 168.64s |  of how you can start to build your own lab
168.64s - 170.24s |  and learn some of those things.
171.60s - 174.24s |  So the one thing that I always talk about
174.24s - 175.64s |  with industrial control systems,
175.64s - 179.00s |  why or how are they different than IT
179.00s - 181.32s |  other than being really old?
181.32s - 182.44s |  Health and safety.
182.44s - 183.52s |  Those are the three things, right?
183.64s - 185.48s |  Your email goes out.
185.48s - 186.32s |  What happens?
186.32s - 187.84s |  You have a quiet day, right?
187.84s - 190.08s |  Your website goes down, you lose money.
190.08s - 190.92s |  It's a bad day.
190.92s - 193.72s |  Amazon, Delta we saw, bad day.
195.20s - 198.04s |  Those controllers go down and your grid turns off
198.04s - 200.32s |  or your water plant turns off.
200.32s - 202.32s |  That's health, life and safety.
202.32s - 205.84s |  So those are the three things that I always go back to
205.84s - 207.64s |  when we talk about control systems.
207.64s - 209.48s |  IT, you can turn that stuff off.
209.48s - 211.48s |  You'll have a bad day, you'll have a quiet day.
211.48s - 212.40s |  You're not gonna kill people.
212.40s - 213.56s |  You're not gonna pollute the environment.
213.56s - 217.52s |  You're not gonna destroy things and hurt people.
217.52s - 218.68s |  Way to break us down, man.
218.68s - 220.20s |  I know, how about it?
220.20s - 222.24s |  You made me run all the way downstairs up to here
222.24s - 223.24s |  and we were lost.
224.36s - 225.76s |  We were lost for five minutes.
225.76s - 227.92s |  We could not figure out where this place was.
228.80s - 230.00s |  So here's the good news.
230.00s - 231.40s |  This is why it's easier.
231.40s - 232.92s |  Besides the fact that everything is older
232.92s - 234.24s |  and actually much simpler.
235.48s - 236.32s |  Forgot my point.
240.12s - 243.84s |  Been here seven days and Black Hat was really long, okay?
243.84s - 246.88s |  Is there's a physical effect, right?
246.88s - 249.12s |  Hey, I pop shell, I have an interpreter session.
249.12s - 251.40s |  Okay, hey, data got lost.
251.40s - 252.24s |  What does that mean?
252.24s - 253.84s |  How do I feel that?
253.84s - 255.08s |  With industrial control systems,
255.08s - 257.92s |  there is a physical change in the world, right?
257.92s - 261.48s |  The lights go off, the light bulb goes on, right?
261.48s - 264.48s |  We're not popping calc.exe in a Windows box.
264.48s - 266.68s |  You're actually seeing something change.
266.68s - 269.12s |  So there's a lot more of that physical feedback loop
269.12s - 269.96s |  on the learning.
269.96s - 270.80s |  So how is it set up?
270.80s - 272.36s |  Who's heard of the Purdue model?
273.28s - 274.28s |  We've got some hands, all right.
274.28s - 275.20s |  We've got ringers.
276.92s - 278.12s |  What's the Purdue model?
280.48s - 281.52s |  There are no experts.
293.52s - 295.16s |  Data segmentation, data flow.
299.64s - 302.08s |  So I meant the words that are the correct answer.
303.12s - 303.96s |  No, you got it.
303.96s - 306.60s |  So it is a nominal enterprise architecture
306.60s - 308.28s |  and it breaks down five levels.
308.28s - 310.20s |  The first you all know, IT.
310.20s - 311.84s |  And IT is just one box.
311.84s - 313.64s |  And then there is always,
313.64s - 316.00s |  I want you to all repeat with me, an air gap.
317.40s - 319.40s |  It's not an air gap.
319.40s - 320.44s |  It's not an air gap.
321.60s - 324.32s |  Your IT will always talk to your OT.
324.32s - 325.68s |  And there's a lot of reasons for that.
325.68s - 327.44s |  I've always had, I always love it when there's some nerd
327.44s - 328.56s |  who's like, well, actually,
328.56s - 330.80s |  have you ever like been in a nuclear power plant?
330.80s - 333.92s |  I'm like, yep, the air gap is never pure either.
333.92s - 335.40s |  There's a reason.
335.40s - 337.08s |  So let's just understand that.
337.08s - 339.84s |  Next level up is your DMZ.
339.84s - 341.88s |  So you need shared service functions
341.88s - 344.72s |  because there's still some level of IT functionality.
344.72s - 346.12s |  There's centralized management
346.12s - 348.04s |  that we need to be running these things.
348.04s - 350.32s |  So that's your high level industrial control systems.
350.32s - 352.68s |  Then we start breaking down into what are called
352.68s - 354.28s |  specific control zones.
354.28s - 356.48s |  And so that's basically two, one, zero.
356.48s - 358.20s |  And that's where we have this combination
358.20s - 360.16s |  of engineering workstations,
360.16s - 361.84s |  programmable logic controllers,
361.84s - 365.12s |  the things that are actually making a process do a thing.
365.12s - 366.76s |  Again, going back to my original point,
366.76s - 368.80s |  that process has an output.
368.80s - 370.48s |  That's the cool part about this.
370.48s - 373.64s |  Those subsystems are outputting something.
373.64s - 375.72s |  And so the purpose of the Purdue model
375.72s - 377.64s |  is understanding that segmentation
377.64s - 379.24s |  and then learning how to design
379.24s - 381.52s |  what are called control zones and conduits.
381.52s - 382.92s |  How do I create segmentation
382.92s - 385.88s |  so that if there's an issue on this output over here
385.88s - 387.76s |  that is spitting out this widget,
387.76s - 389.72s |  it doesn't impact something over here?
390.84s - 392.48s |  And then the conduits are my way
392.48s - 394.36s |  of driving still the information,
394.36s - 396.44s |  the data flow that I need to have between them.
396.44s - 398.20s |  Now, here's the problem.
398.20s - 400.40s |  I just said five levels of something.
400.40s - 404.61s |  Doesn't that just feel like defense in depth?
404.61s - 405.85s |  Yes.
405.85s - 406.69s |  Yes.
408.41s - 410.69s |  You were shaking no because you knew where I was going.
410.69s - 412.45s |  The correct answer is in fact, yes.
412.45s - 415.13s |  There are no trick questions, just dumb answers.
415.69s - 417.53s |  I'm glad you all get my sense of humor.
419.17s - 421.25s |  So the point is that all collapses
421.25s - 423.89s |  into what we really see from the threat perspective.
423.89s - 425.73s |  So there's basically two ways,
425.73s - 427.41s |  well, there's actually five ways in,
427.41s - 429.77s |  but we're gonna simplify it to the two common.
429.77s - 431.33s |  The one which you probably hear the most
431.33s - 433.33s |  and gets the most press play is,
433.33s - 435.81s |  oh my gosh, my operational technology devices
435.81s - 437.53s |  are directly connected to the internet.
437.53s - 439.65s |  Look at what showdown or census turned up.
442.17s - 443.53s |  Yeah, it happens.
444.13s - 445.77s |  Yeah, it happens,
445.77s - 448.25s |  but it's not the most common access vector.
448.25s - 450.49s |  The most common access vector is what you see
450.49s - 453.57s |  in most of your daily enterprise IT lives
453.57s - 457.41s |  because IT is the big squishy thing on the internet.
457.41s - 459.25s |  That's its entire purpose.
459.25s - 461.25s |  And I'm not gonna guess you're all model employees.
461.25s - 463.29s |  So you're not just surfing the web
463.29s - 468.37s |  instead of doing your jobs.
468.37s - 469.21s |  Take the credit.
469.21s - 472.13s |  That's about the nicest thing I'm gonna say to you all day.
472.13s - 474.33s |  We can go back to Dr. Doom here if you want.
477.57s - 480.13s |  So all of those tactics that you see in IT
480.13s - 482.33s |  are the same ones that we have to worry about.
482.33s - 484.37s |  They come in, they pivot, they move.
484.37s - 486.21s |  And again, because an air gap is not an air gap,
486.21s - 488.73s |  it's not an air gap, I cross over.
488.73s - 491.33s |  Now we still have three to four levels,
491.33s - 493.49s |  actually four levels on that side,
493.49s - 495.09s |  but here's where they all collapse.
495.09s - 497.09s |  So you've all aware of the like gloom and doom
497.09s - 498.17s |  cyber weapons, right?
498.17s - 499.81s |  We know about indestroyer, indestroyer two,
499.81s - 502.29s |  we've seen the Russian military using in Ukraine.
502.29s - 504.89s |  That's not the thing we have to worry about most.
504.97s - 507.49s |  The same way that PowerShell pretty much defines
507.49s - 513.87s |  what happens in IT, same thing in OT.
513.87s - 514.95s |  It's the living off the land,
514.95s - 517.55s |  taking over those high level industrial control systems,
517.55s - 520.19s |  they tell everything else what to do.
520.19s - 522.39s |  So now we've anchored how this works,
522.39s - 523.71s |  what we got to worry about.
523.71s - 526.23s |  Now let's talk about how we start to teach ourselves.
527.31s - 528.15s |  Labs.
528.15s - 532.39s |  So if anybody has not been in the ISS village downstairs,
532.39s - 534.27s |  back in the corner, please stop by.
534.31s - 537.43s |  We'll show you what we have, our hands on demos.
537.43s - 538.75s |  Yes, we know where that is.
538.75s - 540.67s |  And it's far, but not that far.
541.59s - 543.43s |  It's not in another building, right?
543.43s - 546.19s |  So how do we build these systems?
546.19s - 548.87s |  How do we build in an environment where we can train?
548.87s - 551.51s |  We can see if our patches work.
551.51s - 552.59s |  That's a really important one.
552.59s - 554.27s |  Never patch production, right?
556.07s - 557.83s |  Live anyway, you want to patch production,
557.83s - 560.27s |  but you want to test those patches before you push it out
560.27s - 562.67s |  or things happen.
562.67s - 563.59s |  How do we do that?
563.59s - 567.83s |  Well, with ICS village and my day job and all that,
567.83s - 569.11s |  we build these systems out.
569.11s - 574.03s |  So what we've been doing, we don't use virtualized systems,
574.03s - 578.11s |  but we'll use virtualized systems when it should be used,
578.11s - 579.87s |  such as HMIs and things like that, right?
579.87s - 580.71s |  They're all virtualized.
580.71s - 582.95s |  They're just window assets.
582.95s - 586.15s |  When we get down to controllers,
587.11s - 589.03s |  we're using the real ones, right?
589.03s - 590.19s |  We're not using a Raspberry Pi.
590.19s - 592.19s |  Sure, you can use OpenPLC, you can do all these other ones.
592.19s - 594.39s |  But the reason why we're not doing that downstairs
594.39s - 598.47s |  in ICS village is they just don't work the same.
598.47s - 601.35s |  So when you go out and you want to learn
601.35s - 602.27s |  how these systems work,
602.27s - 603.87s |  whether you're interested in control system
603.87s - 604.71s |  to get a job in it,
604.71s - 608.35s |  or you're a working practitioner professional now in it,
608.35s - 609.55s |  how do you do this?
610.55s - 611.55s |  We source stuff from eBay.
611.55s - 613.07s |  We source stuff from our vendors.
613.07s - 615.95s |  We get stuff donated to us, but-
615.95s - 617.27s |  How can I buy something from eBay?
617.27s - 619.07s |  How would I make that work for home?
619.11s - 624.11s |  The, so I wouldn't recommend that actually.
626.75s - 629.03s |  The problem is that we run into,
629.03s - 630.47s |  you buy that thing from eBay.
630.47s - 631.63s |  Well, great, now you need a license.
631.63s - 632.47s |  Now you need a key.
632.47s - 633.31s |  Now you need that thing.
633.31s - 634.15s |  You need that thing.
634.15s - 635.07s |  You need that cable, all that stuff.
635.07s - 636.59s |  That stuff's not trivial.
636.59s - 638.99s |  Once you're using it, yes, now you understand.
638.99s - 641.95s |  But for somebody to take that thing from,
641.95s - 644.91s |  you know, that Allen Bradley controller from eBay
644.91s - 646.83s |  that you bought for 150 bucks,
646.83s - 647.95s |  well, where's the cable?
647.95s - 648.83s |  Where's the license?
649.59s - 651.63s |  That gets quite difficult.
651.63s - 653.39s |  Come volunteer for ICS Village.
653.39s - 655.59s |  We'll show you how to do that stuff.
655.59s - 658.47s |  We can get you connected with different universities,
658.47s - 661.79s |  work colleges, learning institutions,
661.79s - 662.99s |  show you how to do that.
664.23s - 667.55s |  One of the things that we're constantly saying
667.55s - 668.67s |  to people when they come up,
668.67s - 670.99s |  they're saying, hey, where do I start?
670.99s - 671.95s |  What do I do?
673.51s - 675.03s |  We're looking at authentication.
675.03s - 676.71s |  We're looking at segmentation.
676.75s - 679.35s |  We're looking at knowing what's on your network.
679.35s - 681.51s |  Well, what does that even mean?
681.51s - 683.79s |  So, you know, whether you're gonna walk down
683.79s - 686.55s |  your plant floor, whether you're gonna take PCAPs,
686.55s - 687.47s |  whether you're gonna do something,
687.47s - 690.51s |  know what's on your network, your asset detection.
690.51s - 693.39s |  Authentication, don't leave everything admin-admin.
693.39s - 696.35s |  However, that's a legitimate thing now.
696.35s - 699.27s |  You go into that, you know, nuclear plant
699.27s - 701.11s |  like Price just talked about here.
701.11s - 702.43s |  Well, you have guard gates and guns
702.43s - 703.75s |  and you're seven layers down.
703.75s - 704.91s |  Does it really matter at that point?
704.91s - 709.07s |  If your sticky note has that, I don't think it does.
709.07s - 712.63s |  Because if your adversary's in there that far anyway,
712.63s - 714.15s |  you're done.
715.07s - 717.83s |  But what you need is to be able to get into that HMI
717.83s - 719.23s |  or get into that thing really quick
719.23s - 721.11s |  to turn that thing off or on or whatever.
721.11s - 723.27s |  So it's a balance, right?
723.27s - 725.31s |  If you have a gateway device,
725.31s - 727.71s |  now don't use admin-admin, that's really bad,
727.71s - 729.39s |  complicated passwords.
729.39s - 731.47s |  And then segmentation.
731.47s - 734.79s |  Now, those are the three things that we come back
735.55s - 736.39s |  and say, hey, you do those three things,
736.39s - 738.51s |  you're going to make your life
738.51s - 741.55s |  or your network so much more secure.
741.55s - 742.87s |  Do we have a lot of other things off that?
742.87s - 744.19s |  Yes, but those are the three things
744.19s - 745.35s |  that we keep on going back.
745.35s - 747.11s |  So how does that tie in with labs?
747.11s - 748.23s |  Well, how do you patch something?
748.23s - 749.47s |  How do you go and change that password?
749.47s - 752.11s |  How do you update that X509 server
752.11s - 753.71s |  or whatever cert you have?
753.71s - 754.95s |  That's not trivial.
754.95s - 758.35s |  If you're doing it, okay, that works.
758.35s - 760.35s |  But now come back three years later
760.35s - 762.59s |  and learn how those certs work and how you updated that.
762.59s - 764.87s |  Guarantee, unless you're doing that on a day-by-day,
764.87s - 766.71s |  you're not going to figure it out.
766.71s - 769.39s |  But now it's running a real production device.
769.39s - 773.03s |  So it's, sorry, I hear they're yelling at us
773.03s - 775.03s |  to get off the stage now.
775.03s - 777.07s |  Anyway, we came late.
777.07s - 779.19s |  We have a lot of stuff to talk about.
779.19s - 781.95s |  Come downstairs, ICS Village.
781.95s - 784.03s |  We have a lot of really great volunteers down there.
784.03s - 785.39s |  Bryce and I are down there.
786.23s - 787.39s |  We'll show you what's going on.
787.39s - 788.91s |  We will do all that stuff.
788.91s - 791.47s |  He's yelling at me again the second time he's come in.
791.47s - 793.39s |  That guy in the red shirt,
793.39s - 795.31s |  yelling at the guys that were late.
795.31s - 796.43s |  Thank you, everyone.
796.43s - 801.03s |  Our apologies for coming up here and doing this.
801.03s - 802.91s |  Yes, yes, yes.
802.91s - 811.64s |  Ashley, yes.
811.64s - 813.44s |  So it's not what we do.
813.44s - 816.48s |  We go off of usually like SANS critical controls.
816.48s - 818.16s |  We go off of industry things
818.16s - 819.36s |  because why?
819.36s - 820.96s |  They work, they're right.
820.96s - 830.30s |  That's what you need.
830.30s - 831.54s |  Yep, we're happy to do that.
831.54s - 832.62s |  We're done, we're done.
832.62s - 833.46s |  Thank you.
