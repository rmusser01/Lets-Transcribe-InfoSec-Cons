**Introduction to Galah**

- **Galah**: An **LLM-powered web honeypot** mimicking diverse applications with a single prompt
- Dynamically crafts relevant **HTTP responses** to simulate multiple web applications

**Purpose and Goals**

- **Monitoring internet-wide scans** and understanding attackers' techniques
- Addressing performance of different **large language models** in generating HTTP messages
- Evaluating if **authentic-looking HTTP responses** increase attackers' engagement

**Traditional vs. LLM-Powered Honeypots**

- Traditional **low-interaction web honeypots** require manual emulation of applications
- Galah offers a more **dynamic approach** by leveraging LLMs for realistic responses

**Benefits of LLM-Based Honeypots**

- **Improving honeypots** with dynamic responses
- Increasing attacker engagement with **realistic responses**
- **Evaluating LLMs** for various security use cases

**Galah's Functionality**

- Receives requests and generates responses using **LLMs**
- Utilizes a **rule config** for controlling responses
- Implements **caching** to avoid redundant LLM usage
- Supports **various LLM providers** including open models

**Prompt Design**

- Includes **system and user prompts** for generating responses
- Emphasizes **instruction clarity** to ensure quality responses
- Structures output in **JSON format** for easy extraction

**Challenges and Solutions**

- **JSON output**: Difficult to achieve valid JSON, but recent features help
- **Response validation**: Includes checks and cleaning of LLM-generated responses

**Evaluation and Findings**

- OpenAI models provide **convincing responses**
- **Safety prioritization** by Anthropic, avoiding exploitation responses
- Open models like **LlamaTree and Mistral** show promising results
- **Increased attacker engagement** observed in some cases

**Adversarial Testing**

- Basic adversarial tests like asking “**are you a honeypot**” reveal vulnerabilities
- **Fine-tuning** can improve response accuracy to adversarial queries

**Conclusion**

- LLM-based honeypots like Galah show promise in **dynamic response generation**
- Further research and data are needed to fully understand engagement impacts
