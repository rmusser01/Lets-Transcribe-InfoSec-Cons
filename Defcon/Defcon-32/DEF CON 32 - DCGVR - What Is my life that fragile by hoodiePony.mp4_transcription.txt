3.38s - 6.66s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 I'd like to introduce Hoodie Pony, all the way from Melbourne.
6.66s - 10.78s |  I have to say this right, hold on, Melbourne, Australia.
10.78s - 18.02s |  He's from DEF CON group 11613, and he will be presenting, what is my, what, sorry, let
18.02s - 23.10s |  me say this correctly, what is my life that fragile?
23.10s - 30.30s |  The increased dependency on the digital life to participate in society means digital life
30.30s - 31.90s |  is real life.
31.90s - 37.14s |  With that, the consequences of failure and confidentiality, integrity, and availability
37.14s - 41.02s |  of our digital self can have dire consequences.
41.02s - 46.70s |  So I threat modeled living in 2024, and it's more fragile than I thought.
46.70s - 50.06s |  How digitally resilient do you think you are?
50.06s - 56.18s |  Let's talk about that and do some things we can, and talk about some things we can do
56.18s - 57.18s |  about it.
57.18s - 63.34s |  Hoodie Pony is just a friendly, local, cyber security Sherpa, helping people verifiably
63.34s - 68.50s |  build a safer, secure, and more resilient world by sharing knowledge through telling
68.50s - 69.50s |  stories.
69.50s - 77.42s |  This includes the privilege of presenting here at DEF CON group's VR community event
77.42s - 86.26s |  previously and a keynote at, I don't know what that one is, CH CON New Zealand, amongst
86.26s - 94.82s |  many other conferences, Hoodie Pony is grounded by the many years of experience spent security
94.82s - 101.78s |  advising and assessing critical infrastructure in Australia and governments to small startups.
101.78s - 107.38s |  That said, Hoodie Pony is just another nerd figuring out how things work, tinkering and
107.38s - 112.70s |  challenging assumptions, sharing a story so we can all make better informed decisions
112.70s - 114.70s |  through broader perspectives.
114.70s - 118.30s |  And with that, I'd introduce him, but apparently he's disappeared off the planet.
118.30s - 120.30s |  Let me check real quick and see where he went.
120.30s - 122.50s |  I'm here.
122.50s - 124.78s |  Is the network having issues?
124.78s - 127.34s |  Am I having the same issue as...
127.34s - 131.33s |  I can see you.
131.33s - 132.33s |  Hello?
132.33s - 135.77s |  Is he here or am I just not seeing him?
135.77s - 136.77s |  Hello?
136.77s - 137.77s |  Yeah.
137.77s - 138.77s |  Hello?
138.77s - 139.77s |  He's...
139.77s - 140.77s |  Hello?
140.77s - 141.77s |  Am I having the same issue as Alan?
141.77s - 143.77s |  Is this an Australia problem?
143.77s - 144.77s |  He's still there on YouTube.
145.41s - 146.41s |  I don't think so.
146.41s - 147.41s |  I can see you.
147.41s - 148.41s |  See me or Hoodie Pony?
148.41s - 149.41s |  Both of you.
149.41s - 150.41s |  You're both right there.
150.41s - 151.41s |  Oh, okay.
151.41s - 154.41s |  Well, in that case, I'll get off the stage and let you proceed.
154.41s - 155.41s |  Okay.
155.41s - 159.89s |  So before I start, like, y'all can see me, right?
159.89s - 162.89s |  It's not that Australia has just disappeared off the map, right?
162.89s - 165.49s |  Yes?
165.49s - 166.49s |  Am I coming through?
166.49s - 167.49s |  You're all good.
167.49s - 168.49s |  I'm good?
168.49s - 169.49s |  You're good.
169.49s - 170.49s |  Cool.
170.49s - 171.49s |  Australia did not disappear yet.
171.61s - 172.61s |  Cool.
172.61s - 173.61s |  Okay.
173.61s - 174.61s |  Let me get started.
174.61s - 175.61s |  Why am I hearing myself?
175.61s - 176.61s |  Hey, Hoodie.
176.61s - 177.61s |  We can't hear you if you're trying to talk.
177.61s - 178.61s |  Huh?
178.61s - 179.61s |  I can hear, Hoodie.
179.61s - 180.61s |  You can?
180.61s - 181.61s |  Oh, crap.
181.61s - 182.61s |  Okay.
182.61s - 183.61s |  We can see you now, but earlier you were only on YouTube.
183.61s - 184.61s |  Eh?
184.61s - 185.61s |  Okay.
185.61s - 186.61s |  Okay.
186.61s - 187.61s |  Here we are.
187.61s - 188.61s |  Are we having an audio issue?
188.61s - 189.61s |  Yeah.
189.61s - 190.61s |  Okay.
190.61s - 191.61s |  Okay.
191.61s - 192.61s |  Okay.
192.61s - 193.61s |  Okay.
193.61s - 194.61s |  Okay.
194.61s - 195.61s |  Okay.
195.61s - 196.61s |  Okay.
196.61s - 197.61s |  Okay.
197.61s - 198.61s |  Okay.
198.61s - 199.61s |  Okay.
199.61s - 200.61s |  Okay.
200.73s - 201.73s |  Okay.
201.73s - 202.73s |  Are we having an Australia problem again?
202.73s - 203.73s |  Yeah.
203.73s - 204.73s |  Essentially, yeah.
204.73s - 205.73s |  Okay.
205.73s - 210.73s |  I think it's just better just flow with it.
210.73s - 211.73s |  We'll watch on YouTube.
211.73s - 212.73s |  I think that's the best option.
212.73s - 213.73s |  Okay.
213.73s - 214.73s |  Cool.
214.73s - 215.73s |  Alrighty.
215.73s - 216.73s |  I can hear you.
216.73s - 217.73s |  Your talk is making its point already.
217.73s - 218.73s |  Yeah, I know, right?
218.73s - 219.73s |  Good day, all.
219.73s - 220.73s |  Life for many here.
220.73s - 221.73s |  Carly, you're on mute.
221.73s - 222.73s |  I am.
222.73s - 223.73s |  I am.
223.73s - 224.73s |  I am.
224.73s - 225.73s |  I am.
225.73s - 226.73s |  I am.
226.73s - 227.73s |  I am.
227.73s - 228.73s |  I am.
228.73s - 229.73s |  I am.
230.55s - 231.55s |  Sorry.
231.55s - 232.55s |  Sorry.
232.55s - 233.55s |  Sorry.
233.55s - 234.55s |  Sorry.
234.55s - 235.55s |  Sorry.
235.55s - 236.55s |  Sorry.
236.55s - 237.55s |  Sorry.
237.55s - 238.55s |  Sorry.
238.55s - 239.55s |  Sorry.
239.55s - 240.55s |  Sorry.
240.55s - 241.55s |  Sorry.
241.55s - 242.55s |  Sorry.
242.55s - 243.55s |  Sorry.
243.55s - 244.55s |  Sorry.
244.55s - 245.55s |  Sorry.
245.55s - 246.55s |  Sorry.
246.55s - 249.08s |  Sorry.
249.08s - 250.08s |  Sorry.
250.08s - 251.08s |  Corry's talk on commodification last year resonated with me as I see my daily
251.08s - 252.08s |  life increasingly dependent on yet another digital service.
252.08s - 253.08s |  Something felt real uneasy to me.
253.08s - 254.08s |  Then it hit one day.
254.08s - 258.98s |  I was doing some prioritisation work with a risk register.
258.98s - 260.80s |  Risk, very high.
260.80s - 262.80s |  Impact.
262.80s - 264.80s |  Potential death of multiple people.
264.80s - 266.80s |  Likelihood.
266.80s - 268.80s |  Moderate. Well, we've seen
268.80s - 270.80s |  about a handful of these happen
270.80s - 272.80s |  in the last year or so.
272.80s - 274.80s |  Eh. But
274.80s - 276.80s |  we've already kind of externalised the
276.80s - 278.80s |  liability of that risk, so based
278.80s - 280.80s |  on our risk appetite policy,
280.80s - 285.08s |  we accept the risk.
285.08s - 287.08s |  Well, hold up.
287.08s - 289.08s |  Potential death of multiple
289.08s - 291.08s |  people? Say what?
291.08s - 296.79s |  If we talk in video game
296.79s - 298.79s |  terms, I,
298.79s - 300.79s |  as a human, I'm playing a single
300.79s - 302.79s |  attempt zero death run.
302.79s - 304.79s |  Whereas, I was writing a
304.79s - 306.79s |  risk register for
306.79s - 308.79s |  an organisation where
308.79s - 310.79s |  response with minor
310.79s - 312.79s |  penalties were available.
312.79s - 314.79s |  Choices we make and the consequences
314.79s - 316.79s |  of
316.79s - 318.79s |  who and what you depend
318.79s - 320.79s |  on is remarkably different.
320.79s - 322.79s |  It's
322.79s - 324.79s |  potentially a matter of
324.79s - 326.79s |  survival.
326.79s - 331.48s |  That disconnect, eh?
331.48s - 333.48s |  Risk accepted carries a very
333.48s - 335.48s |  different meaning now, doesn't it?
335.48s - 337.48s |  Especially if
337.48s - 339.48s |  your own life is the
339.48s - 341.48s |  one that's on the line.
341.48s - 349.72s |  What can we do about it?
349.72s - 353.89s |  Like any security professional,
353.89s - 355.89s |  we can assess the risk
355.89s - 357.89s |  and maybe make a plan to manage
357.89s - 362.36s |  it.
362.36s - 364.36s |  And a sensible thing
364.36s - 366.36s |  to do is to first understand
366.36s - 368.36s |  the operational landscape and the
368.36s - 370.36s |  influencing factors to help us
370.36s - 372.36s |  decide how we should act.
372.36s - 374.36s |  How we should act.
374.36s - 376.36s |  Since it's not
376.36s - 378.36s |  practical to fully consider
378.36s - 380.36s |  all possibilities, we do this
380.36s - 382.36s |  through using a threat model to help
382.36s - 384.36s |  develop our understanding.
384.36s - 386.36s |  It feels like an Australia thing, hey?
386.36s - 388.36s |  So,
388.36s - 390.36s |  what scenario are we threat modelling?
390.36s - 392.36s |  An effective way to understand
392.36s - 394.36s |  the tendency is to, well,
394.36s - 396.36s |  turn the whole system off and see what it impacts.
396.36s - 399.83s |  So,
399.83s - 401.83s |  well, what happens
401.83s - 403.83s |  when a whole country, say Australia,
403.83s - 405.83s |  suddenly
405.83s - 407.83s |  disconnects from
407.83s - 411.65s |  the greater Internet?
411.65s - 413.65s |  The irony of this statement.
413.65s - 415.65s |  Well,
415.65s - 417.65s |  the recent
417.65s - 419.65s |  incident gave us a canary into the
419.65s - 421.65s |  consequences, but
421.65s - 423.65s |  what we can do is a threat model.
423.65s - 425.65s |  Doing it practically
425.65s - 427.65s |  will be, well,
427.65s - 431.60s |  quite devastating.
431.60s - 433.60s |  I'm in Australia and fortunately
433.60s - 435.60s |  for this threat model, we're an island.
435.60s - 437.60s |  And the likelihood that
437.60s - 439.60s |  an incident that would disconnect us from the
439.60s - 441.60s |  Internet isn't that far-fetched.
441.60s - 445.46s |  There are only 15 cables that
445.46s - 447.46s |  connect us to the outside world
447.46s - 449.46s |  and they all pass through earthquake
449.46s - 451.46s |  fault lines and contentious
451.46s - 453.46s |  waters. Well,
453.46s - 455.46s |  also noting that,
455.46s - 457.46s |  yeah, there's supposed
457.46s - 459.46s |  to be incidents happening
459.46s - 461.46s |  in the
461.46s - 463.46s |  earthquake situation.
463.46s - 465.46s |  So, maybe that's affecting us right now.
465.46s - 467.46s |  I don't know. I'm in Australia.
467.46s - 471.41s |  We're an island. It's a concern.
471.41s - 473.41s |  It's an issue
473.41s - 475.41s |  that has happened in our neighbourhood more than a few
475.41s - 477.41s |  times in the last few years. Heck,
477.41s - 479.41s |  there's even an article just a
479.41s - 481.41s |  few weeks old about that
481.41s - 487.57s |  concern. So, using
487.57s - 489.57s |  NIST SB 830
489.57s - 491.57s |  as guidance, that means
491.57s - 493.57s |  likelihood of a
493.57s - 495.57s |  disconnection situation as moderate.
495.57s - 497.57s |  Maybe more, given
497.57s - 499.57s |  the connectivity issues
499.57s - 501.57s |  I'm having right now.
501.57s - 505.68s |  It's an honest threat evaluation
505.68s - 507.68s |  so that we can make
507.68s - 509.68s |  informed decisions and prepare for it.
509.68s - 511.68s |  Let's not even start
511.68s - 513.68s |  with the complexities of staying legally compliant.
513.68s - 515.68s |  Local laws and regulations
515.68s - 517.68s |  are challenging enough.
517.68s - 519.68s |  International law? Oh, that's a
519.68s - 521.68s |  whole different level.
521.68s - 523.68s |  Especially if they conflict
523.68s - 525.68s |  with local laws and I'm not a
525.68s - 530.44s |  lawyer. Let's
530.44s - 532.44s |  put all of that aside for now
532.44s - 534.44s |  and keep the disconnection physical
534.44s - 536.44s |  for SI Layer 1.
536.44s - 538.44s |  Am I
538.44s - 540.44s |  coming through? I can see somebody
540.44s - 542.44s |  talking.
542.44s - 546.55s |  Is this working? Yes, you're
546.55s - 548.55s |  working just fine. Cool. Okay.
548.55s - 550.55s |  Continuing.
550.55s - 552.55s |  Thank you.
552.55s - 554.55s |  Now that we have our
554.55s - 556.55s |  scenario,
556.55s - 558.55s |  and
558.55s - 560.55s |  we know we can't quite model every single
560.55s - 562.55s |  service and dependency, that'd be unrealistic, and
562.55s - 564.55s |  we'll be here far too long
564.55s - 566.55s |  and it's really getting late.
566.55s - 568.55s |  Let's begin a simple threat
568.55s - 570.55s |  model. Email.
572.55s - 574.55s |  Why email?
574.55s - 576.55s |  It's a well-known public
576.55s - 578.55s |  standard, a well-known commodity
578.55s - 580.55s |  that everyone kind of depends on, right?
580.55s - 582.55s |  Its parts
582.55s - 584.55s |  are comparatively more transparent than services
584.55s - 586.55s |  like, say, I don't know, payments, energy
586.55s - 588.55s |  infrastructure, which
588.55s - 590.55s |  are significantly more regulated and
590.55s - 592.55s |  complex than
592.55s - 594.55s |  we need for our example here.
594.55s - 599.97s |  Our email address serves
599.97s - 601.97s |  as a proxy of our identity.
601.97s - 603.97s |  It acts as our main formal
603.97s - 605.97s |  communications channel online.
605.97s - 607.97s |  It is the anchor of our digital
607.97s - 611.54s |  identity, including
611.54s - 613.54s |  with government agencies like
613.54s - 615.54s |  ADME in the U.S. and iGov
615.54s - 619.11s |  and the tax office here in Australia.
619.11s - 621.11s |  It also serves as legal records
621.11s - 623.11s |  for our purchases, agreements, receipts,
623.11s - 625.11s |  communications, etc., etc., and
625.11s - 627.11s |  the last contract you signed,
627.11s - 629.11s |  purchase,
629.11s - 631.11s |  job, etc.,
631.11s - 633.11s |  there's a high likelihood it was
633.11s - 636.87s |  delivered to you via email.
636.87s - 638.87s |  Without our email addresses, we are
638.87s - 640.87s |  effectively dead
640.87s - 642.87s |  in this digital-first environment.
642.87s - 644.87s |  So,
644.87s - 646.87s |  rather important, eh?
646.87s - 648.87s |  So, let's see. Good place
648.87s - 653.62s |  to start. Yeah.
653.62s - 656.96s |  So, email.
656.96s - 664.24s |  Simple, right? For many,
664.24s - 666.24s |  our interaction with email is via
666.24s - 668.24s |  an email provider which handles it all for us,
668.24s - 670.24s |  including the client interface
670.24s - 672.24s |  we interact with
672.24s - 674.24s |  and the sending of
674.24s - 676.24s |  that email, like
676.24s - 678.24s |  iCloud Mail,
678.24s - 680.24s |  Microsoft Outlook, Google's Gmail,
680.24s - 682.24s |  maybe ProtonMail for the privacy
682.24s - 688.08s |  challenges. How many of us here
688.08s - 690.08s |  have looked at how email
690.08s - 692.08s |  actually works?
692.08s - 694.08s |  For people like my parents,
694.08s - 696.08s |  email's just that magical service
696.08s - 698.08s |  that I get mail in.
698.08s - 700.08s |  But
700.08s - 702.08s |  email's made of
702.08s - 705.33s |  more than that. There's a bunch of
705.33s - 707.33s |  standards and dependencies that make email work.
707.33s - 712.50s |  So, what makes up email?
712.50s - 714.50s |  Well,
714.50s - 716.50s |  here's a list of RFCs that are
716.50s - 718.50s |  related. There's a lot we can
718.50s - 720.50s |  get into, but let's just focus on
720.50s - 722.50s |  some of the dependencies rather than digging
722.50s - 724.50s |  deep into protocol descriptions
724.50s - 726.50s |  and how it
726.50s - 728.50s |  handshakes and works.
728.50s - 730.50s |  So, what are some of these
730.50s - 732.50s |  dependencies for an email to be sent from,
732.50s - 734.50s |  say, one address
734.50s - 736.50s |  to another?
736.50s - 738.50s |  From one .au address to
738.50s - 743.00s |  another. So,
743.00s - 745.00s |  look at the domain name.
745.00s - 747.00s |  That's how
747.00s - 749.00s |  we know which IP address to connect
749.00s - 752.24s |  to, right? Then
752.24s - 754.24s |  we look at IP and IP routing.
754.24s - 756.24s |  That's how local ISPs
756.24s - 758.24s |  find their way and move the email packets
758.24s - 760.24s |  around and do that whole
760.24s - 762.24s |  delivery thing.
762.24s - 764.24s |  And there's the digital
764.24s - 766.24s |  certificates.
766.24s - 768.24s |  The TLS and modern
768.24s - 770.24s |  email security depends heavily on this
770.24s - 772.24s |  for encryption and authentication.
772.24s - 776.74s |  Then there's email software.
776.74s - 778.74s |  Your mail delivery
778.74s - 780.74s |  agents
780.74s - 782.74s |  dropping email from
782.74s - 784.74s |  your machine to your local inbox, email user
784.74s - 786.74s |  agents, your actual interface that you
786.74s - 788.74s |  interface with your email, your
788.74s - 790.74s |  mail transfer agent, software that actually
790.74s - 792.74s |  sends email between computers.
792.74s - 794.74s |  And
794.74s - 796.74s |  well, there's the operating system that
796.74s - 801.59s |  it runs on.
801.59s - 803.59s |  But let's not open that
803.59s - 805.59s |  Pandora's box.
805.59s - 807.59s |  And, yeah,
807.59s - 809.59s |  that's another rabbit hole.
809.59s - 811.59s |  With that quick refresh on how email
811.59s - 813.59s |  works, let's do a quick trend model
813.59s - 819.62s |  of email. One quick reminder.
819.62s - 821.62s |  Well,
821.62s - 823.62s |  the scenario is that Australia gets fully
823.62s - 831.86s |  disconnected from the global internet.
831.86s - 833.86s |  Let's talk about some
833.86s - 835.86s |  common email as a service
835.86s - 837.86s |  providers. We'll ask three simple questions.
837.86s - 839.86s |  Are the
839.86s - 841.86s |  email servers with my data
841.86s - 846.52s |  local in Australia?
846.52s - 848.52s |  Will we be able to access and download
848.52s - 850.52s |  our email from within Australia?
850.52s - 852.52s |  And will we be able
852.52s - 854.52s |  to receive email to other local TLDs
854.52s - 856.52s |  such as, you know,
856.52s - 858.52s |  a .au to .au?
858.52s - 860.52s |  We'll take a look at four providers.
860.52s - 862.52s |  Microsoft Outlook, Gmail, Proton, and Fastmail.
862.52s - 865.99s |  So let's start with Microsoft Outlook.
865.99s - 872.82s |  Microsoft Outlook,
872.82s - 874.82s |  it has data residency
874.82s - 876.82s |  options for their enterprise
876.82s - 878.82s |  accounts. It mentions
878.82s - 880.82s |  storage of data at rest
880.82s - 882.82s |  of Exchange
882.82s - 884.82s |  Online mailbox content, but
884.82s - 886.82s |  I couldn't really find
886.82s - 888.82s |  anything much about
888.82s - 890.82s |  personal Outlook
890.82s - 892.82s |  or Microsoft accounts besides
892.82s - 894.82s |  this small little snippet in
894.82s - 903.64s |  the privacy policy. Quick question.
903.64s - 905.64s |  When you select a data
905.64s - 907.64s |  residency region in Australia,
907.64s - 911.17s |  Australia,
911.17s - 913.17s |  raise your hand if you know for certain
913.17s - 915.17s |  if you'll be able to log in and access
915.17s - 917.17s |  your email. If, say,
917.17s - 919.17s |  I don't know,
919.17s - 921.17s |  US Central went
921.17s - 928.84s |  offline.
928.84s - 934.48s |  I'm not so sure.
934.48s - 936.48s |  Well, there's DNS,
936.48s - 938.48s |  which is reliant on the .com
938.48s - 940.48s |  TLD route, but that might be
940.48s - 942.48s |  cached, so maybe?
942.48s - 944.48s |  Then there's this.
944.48s - 946.48s |  Well,
946.48s - 948.48s |  as you can see from this,
948.48s - 950.48s |  the ability to access
950.48s - 952.48s |  is down.
952.48s - 954.48s |  So despite
954.48s - 956.48s |  having the data physically
956.48s - 958.48s |  in Australia,
958.48s - 960.48s |  we have no way to access it
960.48s - 962.48s |  because the
962.48s - 964.48s |  gates are down.
964.48s - 966.48s |  This is for Azure, but
966.48s - 968.48s |  it does raise the question.
968.48s - 971.83s |  Since we can't access the service,
971.83s - 973.83s |  sending and receiving email is also
973.83s - 979.89s |  questionable. So moving
979.89s - 981.89s |  on then, Gmail
981.89s - 983.89s |  or Google Workspace,
983.89s - 985.89s |  whichever flavor,
985.89s - 987.89s |  it has data
987.89s - 989.89s |  regions for
989.89s - 991.89s |  Workspace Enterprise, but it's
991.89s - 993.89s |  only US and Europe. So it
993.89s - 995.89s |  doesn't quite help our scenario.
995.89s - 997.89s |  It covers data address and
997.89s - 999.89s |  processing. I couldn't find
999.89s - 1001.89s |  anything much about personal
1001.89s - 1003.89s |  Gmail accounts, so
1003.89s - 1005.89s |  hmm?
1005.89s - 1007.89s |  Well, if we go
1007.89s - 1009.89s |  on and take a look at this,
1009.89s - 1011.89s |  from an outage in 2020,
1011.89s - 1013.89s |  it affected even the EU, so
1013.89s - 1015.89s |  I'm guessing we in Australia
1015.89s - 1020.26s |  won't be able to log in.
1020.26s - 1022.26s |  We also see that sending and receiving
1022.26s - 1024.26s |  emails to be a problem,
1024.26s - 1026.26s |  as this tweet from
1026.26s - 1029.67s |  Proton shows.
1029.67s - 1031.67s |  Speaking of
1031.67s - 1033.67s |  Proton,
1033.67s - 1035.67s |  well, it's
1035.67s - 1039.49s |  probably based
1039.49s - 1041.49s |  in Switzerland,
1041.49s - 1043.49s |  including their infrastructure,
1043.49s - 1045.49s |  so that's a clear
1045.49s - 1047.49s |  no to all three questions.
1047.49s - 1049.49s |  If we can't reach it, there's little
1049.49s - 1053.67s |  we can do, right?
1053.67s - 1055.67s |  Okay, Fastmail.
1055.67s - 1057.67s |  This is hopeful.
1057.67s - 1059.67s |  Right? It's an Australian
1059.67s - 1063.30s |  company. Well,
1063.30s - 1065.30s |  sadly, the infrastructure is
1065.30s - 1067.30s |  based out of New Jersey
1067.30s - 1071.32s |  and Seattle, so I'd say
1071.32s - 1073.32s |  no to all three questions here too.
1073.32s - 1075.32s |  If we can't reach it, the cables are cut.
1075.32s - 1077.32s |  Well,
1077.32s - 1080.82s |  that's pretty much it, eh?
1080.82s - 1082.82s |  Here's a quick review
1082.82s - 1084.82s |  of what we've learned. Only Microsoft
1084.82s - 1090.18s |  came close, but
1090.18s - 1092.18s |  that's for the enterprise accounts,
1092.18s - 1094.18s |  and even that's uncertain.
1094.18s - 1096.18s |  To be clear,
1096.18s - 1098.18s |  these uncriticisms of the service
1098.18s - 1100.18s |  or the resilience engineering that
1100.18s - 1102.18s |  all these services have put into their product
1102.18s - 1104.18s |  don't have their place and
1104.18s - 1106.18s |  do great work, but
1106.18s - 1108.18s |  it is good to know how our
1108.18s - 1110.18s |  dependencies may be impacted
1110.18s - 1112.18s |  in a full disconnection
1112.18s - 1114.18s |  situation.
1114.18s - 1116.18s |  Right?
1116.18s - 1118.18s |  That's our threat scenario right now.
1118.18s - 1120.18s |  All right.
1120.18s - 1122.18s |  Can we even run
1122.18s - 1124.18s |  these ourselves with, say, free
1124.18s - 1126.18s |  open source software if we wanted to?
1126.18s - 1128.18s |  Okay. Let's walk through
1128.18s - 1130.18s |  the dependencies. Remember these from
1130.18s - 1134.93s |  earlier? Let's start with the domain name.
1134.93s - 1136.93s |  To keep things simple,
1136.93s - 1138.93s |  we'll keep it to the .AUTLD.
1138.93s - 1143.24s |  The AU root
1143.24s - 1145.24s |  servers point to an IP address owned by
1145.24s - 1147.24s |  the AU
1147.24s - 1149.24s |  domain administration
1149.24s - 1151.24s |  registrar in
1151.24s - 1153.24s |  Australia, and it's directly
1153.24s - 1155.24s |  paired with multiple
1155.24s - 1158.58s |  users. These servers are run
1158.58s - 1160.58s |  by Identity Digital Australia
1160.58s - 1164.15s |  with local staff and infrastructure,
1164.15s - 1166.15s |  and following that verification
1166.15s - 1168.15s |  journey, let's
1168.15s - 1170.15s |  check if these servers
1170.15s - 1172.15s |  are actually local.
1172.15s - 1174.15s |  We do a little dig trace on the .AU
1174.15s - 1177.72s |  domain, and
1177.72s - 1179.72s |  we have the INR root servers.
1179.72s - 1181.72s |  Not in
1181.72s - 1183.72s |  Australia, but zones files
1183.72s - 1185.72s |  for the .AUTLD can be downloaded
1185.72s - 1187.72s |  and recursive
1187.72s - 1189.72s |  These servers would likely have these
1189.72s - 1191.72s |  bootstrapped.
1191.72s - 1193.72s |  And there's a well-known
1193.72s - 1195.72s |  TLD. These are
1195.72s - 1203.22s |  well-known TLD roots on INR.
1203.22s - 1205.22s |  From the IP addresses,
1205.22s - 1207.22s |  we can see that one
1207.22s - 1209.22s |  is
1209.22s - 1211.22s |  on the AUDA
1211.22s - 1213.22s |  ESN, and
1213.22s - 1215.22s |  the rest are AFRIAS
1215.22s - 1217.22s |  AS. If
1217.22s - 1219.22s |  we ping this, we see a
1219.22s - 1221.22s |  response with
1221.22s - 1223.22s |  a 30 millisecond
1223.22s - 1225.22s |  TTL, which means it's local.
1225.22s - 1230.39s |  Looking at the
1230.39s - 1232.39s |  peering
1232.39s - 1236.15s |  here, looking at the
1236.15s - 1238.15s |  peering, that makes
1238.15s - 1240.15s |  sense, as they are directly peered
1240.15s - 1242.15s |  with local ISPs.
1242.15s - 1244.15s |  It looks like the .AU DNS will
1244.15s - 1247.68s |  keep working. We know local
1247.68s - 1249.68s |  ISP peering
1249.68s - 1251.68s |  is pretty solid, as Australia's
1251.68s - 1253.68s |  remoteness means it's very costly
1253.68s - 1255.68s |  for us to route traffic internationally.
1255.68s - 1257.68s |  You know, us being an island
1257.68s - 1262.37s |  and all that. Okay.
1262.37s - 1264.37s |  Moving on to digital certs.
1264.37s - 1266.37s |  Well, this is where it gets a bit dicey.
1266.37s - 1268.37s |  Looking up the
1268.37s - 1270.37s |  common CADB that
1270.37s - 1272.37s |  the Linux Foundation maintains,
1272.37s - 1274.37s |  and it's kind of used
1274.37s - 1276.37s |  as an authoritative source of
1276.37s - 1278.37s |  root certs, we find
1278.37s - 1280.37s |  no Australian CAs
1280.37s - 1282.37s |  except for one maintained by the Australian
1282.37s - 1284.37s |  Department of Defence.
1284.37s - 1286.37s |  Hmm.
1286.37s - 1288.37s |  Oh, crap. That means
1288.37s - 1290.37s |  either the DoD issues certs
1290.37s - 1292.37s |  or we're pretty much stuck with
1292.37s - 1294.37s |  whatever time we have remaining on our
1294.37s - 1296.37s |  existing TLS certs.
1296.37s - 1298.37s |  That's a
1298.37s - 1300.37s |  maximum of 90 days for
1300.37s - 1302.37s |  Let's Encrypt certificates.
1302.37s - 1304.37s |  Hmm.
1304.37s - 1306.37s |  That means we'll have to either
1306.37s - 1308.37s |  create a new CA and
1308.37s - 1310.37s |  issue it to everyone
1310.37s - 1312.37s |  or turn off
1312.37s - 1314.37s |  the PKI stuff
1314.37s - 1316.37s |  if we get disconnected from the global network.
1316.37s - 1322.95s |  Well, okay.
1322.95s - 1324.95s |  As for email software,
1324.95s - 1326.95s |  ARNet, Australia's
1326.95s - 1328.95s |  research network and ISP, maintains Mirror
1328.95s - 1330.95s |  of various
1330.95s - 1332.95s |  Linux distributions, including its source code.
1332.95s - 1334.95s |  All the servers are local.
1334.95s - 1336.95s |  So, at the risk of
1336.95s - 1338.95s |  following another rabbit hole of dependencies,
1338.95s - 1340.95s |  let's just say we're good on
1340.95s - 1342.95s |  that front.
1342.95s - 1344.95s |  If you're keeping score,
1344.95s - 1346.95s |  looks like IPDNS and email
1346.95s - 1348.95s |  but we can keep working.
1348.95s - 1350.95s |  Okay, we can keep working. However,
1350.95s - 1352.95s |  we have
1352.95s - 1354.95s |  capability gap in issuing valid digital
1354.95s - 1356.95s |  certs
1356.95s - 1358.95s |  that already
1358.95s - 1360.95s |  have their root CAs on our
1360.95s - 1362.95s |  devices.
1362.95s - 1364.95s |  Hmm. Yikes.
1364.95s - 1366.95s |  That means if we are disconnected,
1366.95s - 1368.95s |  we'll lose
1368.95s - 1370.95s |  email, some instantly,
1370.95s - 1372.95s |  others as certificates start to
1372.95s - 1374.95s |  expire, since so much of
1374.95s - 1376.95s |  current email relies on these certificates.
1378.95s - 1380.95s |  Plus,
1380.95s - 1382.95s |  we don't have any local capacity
1382.95s - 1384.95s |  to switch to something, even if we wanted
1384.95s - 1386.95s |  to, because we don't have a local
1386.95s - 1388.95s |  root CA.
1388.95s - 1390.95s |  If we tried, how long would we take?
1390.95s - 1397.59s |  That's just the technical reality
1397.59s - 1399.59s |  of our dependency. We're not even
1399.59s - 1401.59s |  considering the influences of
1401.59s - 1403.59s |  business priorities,
1403.59s - 1405.59s |  local, legal, regulatory, and
1405.59s - 1407.59s |  cultural expectations of where
1407.59s - 1409.59s |  these service providers are
1409.59s - 1414.47s |  based.
1414.47s - 1416.47s |  Oops. Yeah, I should probably have
1416.47s - 1418.47s |  done that.
1418.47s - 1422.42s |  What can go wrong?
1422.42s - 1426.40s |  Let's talk about some of the consequences.
1426.40s - 1428.40s |  Imagine what life would be
1428.40s - 1430.40s |  if you lost access to your mailbox.
1430.40s - 1436.05s |  Finally,
1436.05s - 1438.05s |  that inbox zero.
1438.05s - 1440.05s |  No notifications.
1440.05s - 1446.05s |  Paradise. We saw how badly
1446.05s - 1448.05s |  the CrowdStrike incident impacted
1448.05s - 1450.05s |  us. It impacted
1450.05s - 1452.05s |  food, fuel,
1452.05s - 1454.05s |  transport,
1454.05s - 1456.05s |  healthcare,
1456.05s - 1458.05s |  critical
1458.05s - 1460.05s |  systems ability to communicate,
1460.05s - 1462.05s |  and even the
1462.05s - 1464.05s |  ability to access our money.
1464.05s - 1467.30s |  That impacted our
1467.30s - 1469.30s |  ability to live our lives.
1469.30s - 1471.30s |  Fortunately, this impact
1471.30s - 1473.30s |  didn't last long.
1473.30s - 1475.30s |  And through all the incredible
1475.30s - 1477.30s |  efforts,
1477.30s - 1479.30s |  got things back running in
1479.30s - 1481.30s |  just a few hours, a few
1481.30s - 1488.29s |  days. Let us take a step
1488.29s - 1492.60s |  back and ask, what in our
1492.60s - 1494.60s |  lives depends on us having
1494.60s - 1496.60s |  access to our email?
1496.60s - 1501.48s |  I mentioned a few of this earlier.
1501.48s - 1503.48s |  That's how we communicate.
1503.48s - 1505.48s |  It's how we communicate with our
1505.48s - 1507.48s |  government, banks, telcos,
1507.48s - 1509.48s |  healthcare, landlords, city council,
1509.48s - 1511.48s |  and every aspect of our lives,
1511.48s - 1513.48s |  including being notified of bills and other
1513.48s - 1517.27s |  legal obligations.
1517.27s - 1519.27s |  It serves as a proxy of our identity.
1519.27s - 1521.27s |  It is used as login
1521.27s - 1523.27s |  to our government IDs, like
1523.27s - 1525.27s |  ID.me and myGov in Australia.
1525.27s - 1527.27s |  We agree
1527.27s - 1529.27s |  to transactions via
1529.27s - 1531.27s |  email, like how
1531.27s - 1533.27s |  frequently do you
1533.27s - 1535.27s |  sign and post paper contracts
1535.27s - 1539.35s |  or get confirmation on paper?
1539.35s - 1541.35s |  It is used as login to your banks,
1541.35s - 1543.35s |  PayPal, etc.,
1543.35s - 1545.35s |  where you may be sent an email
1545.35s - 1547.35s |  with a confirmation code as you log in, or
1547.35s - 1549.35s |  even how we send money
1549.35s - 1553.24s |  to each other. How long will
1553.24s - 1555.24s |  you be able to survive without access to your current
1555.24s - 1559.92s |  email? If
1559.92s - 1561.92s |  the CrowdStrike incident
1561.92s - 1563.92s |  was bad, what
1563.92s - 1565.92s |  if you woke up
1565.92s - 1567.92s |  with access to
1567.92s - 1569.92s |  our email provider gone?
1569.92s - 1571.92s |  Well,
1571.92s - 1573.92s |  when Dad found out, after sending
1573.92s - 1575.92s |  pictures of their kid to the doctor
1575.92s - 1582.72s |  for diagnosis, how will
1582.72s - 1589.43s |  you and the ones you love do?
1589.43s - 1591.43s |  Would it be fair to say that loss of
1591.43s - 1593.43s |  data would be a
1593.43s - 1597.60s |  catastrophic consequence?
1597.60s - 1599.60s |  And that's just email.
1599.60s - 1603.04s |  Holy crap.
1603.04s - 1605.04s |  Personally, I didn't know
1605.04s - 1607.04s |  my life was that fragile.
1607.04s - 1618.48s |  Let's do something about it.
1618.48s - 1620.48s |  We can.
1620.48s - 1622.48s |  What we learned from the threat model and
1622.48s - 1624.48s |  scenario is that there is a lot of risk,
1624.48s - 1627.76s |  and we need to make sure that we
1627.76s - 1629.76s |  truly understand these digital systems
1629.76s - 1631.76s |  have very real
1631.76s - 1636.58s |  impact on our lives.
1636.58s - 1638.58s |  Just as the usual advice for this, have backups,
1638.58s - 1640.58s |  have an emergency plan,
1640.58s - 1642.58s |  redundancy in your dependencies.
1642.58s - 1644.58s |  However,
1644.58s - 1646.58s |  as we saw earlier,
1646.58s - 1650.47s |  do we even have the ability to do so?
1650.47s - 1652.47s |  Well, there's only so much we can do
1652.47s - 1654.47s |  individually, as we've seen from the threat model.
1654.47s - 1659.54s |  But
1659.54s - 1661.54s |  now that we know the gaps that we need
1661.54s - 1663.54s |  to fill, we must engage
1663.54s - 1665.54s |  collectively to build a less
1665.54s - 1667.54s |  fragile future for ourselves.
1667.54s - 1669.54s |  It's a team this year.
1669.54s - 1671.54s |  It's hard,
1671.54s - 1673.54s |  but if we don't do it,
1673.54s - 1675.54s |  what future is there for us?
1675.54s - 1677.54s |  So, hackers,
1677.54s - 1679.54s |  let's save this world together.
1679.54s - 1685.06s |  For us to have
1685.06s - 1687.06s |  resilience, we must first have a healthy
1687.06s - 1689.06s |  diversity of providers
1689.06s - 1691.06s |  and approaches necessary for a
1691.06s - 1693.06s |  healthy population.
1693.06s - 1695.06s |  We can learn from nature.
1695.06s - 1697.06s |  Diverse and locally adapted ecosystems
1697.06s - 1702.29s |  thrive and are resilient.
1702.29s - 1704.29s |  Maybe here are some ideas
1704.29s - 1706.29s |  that I think each of us should do.
1706.29s - 1708.29s |  Threat model our own lives,
1708.29s - 1710.29s |  choose better, demand better,
1710.29s - 1712.29s |  and build better.
1712.29s - 1714.29s |  Strengthen the commons,
1714.29s - 1716.29s |  public monies, public code, right?
1716.29s - 1718.29s |  So,
1718.29s - 1720.29s |  number one,
1720.29s - 1722.29s |  threat model your own life
1722.29s - 1724.29s |  and make a plan
1724.29s - 1726.29s |  you can live with. Ask yourself,
1726.29s - 1728.29s |  what do I depend upon?
1728.29s - 1730.29s |  What happens if I no longer have
1730.29s - 1732.29s |  access to it? Or
1732.29s - 1734.29s |  if the service becomes hostile?
1734.29s - 1738.21s |  I've seen that happen recently.
1738.21s - 1740.21s |  What can I do and how can I
1740.21s - 1742.21s |  change my own behavior to minimize the impact
1742.21s - 1744.21s |  it has on me?
1744.21s - 1746.21s |  Well, in this case, as an example,
1746.21s - 1748.21s |  we're talking about email.
1748.21s - 1750.21s |  At this group, we don't have to
1750.21s - 1752.21s |  rehash this
1752.21s - 1754.21s |  and maybe use my own
1754.21s - 1756.21s |  domain and have a backup local
1756.21s - 1760.45s |  service provider.
1760.45s - 1762.45s |  Choose better, demand better,
1762.45s - 1764.45s |  and build better. Demand real choice,
1764.45s - 1766.45s |  demand diversity,
1766.45s - 1768.45s |  demand and build for interoperability.
1768.45s - 1770.45s |  As the market moves,
1770.45s - 1772.45s |  so will providers to fill the demand.
1772.45s - 1774.45s |  Preferably,
1774.45s - 1776.45s |  choose providers
1776.45s - 1778.45s |  that do it,
1778.45s - 1780.45s |  both in our jobs and in our personal life.
1780.45s - 1782.45s |  That means make
1782.45s - 1784.45s |  data portability, interoperability,
1784.45s - 1786.45s |  and support for open standards
1786.45s - 1788.45s |  a requirement when choosing.
1788.45s - 1790.45s |  Don't make yourself a hostage.
1790.45s - 1794.28s |  That's why the EU
1794.28s - 1796.28s |  is pushing for digital sovereignty
1796.28s - 1798.28s |  so that it has the ability
1798.28s - 1800.28s |  to act independently in the
1800.28s - 1802.28s |  digital world. In practice,
1802.28s - 1804.28s |  this doesn't need to be a big bank transition,
1804.28s - 1806.28s |  everything, all or nothing.
1806.28s - 1808.28s |  Just add a bit more diversity
1808.28s - 1810.28s |  to your supply chain
1810.28s - 1812.28s |  as you go. If you're no longer solely
1812.28s - 1814.28s |  dependent, you're no longer
1814.28s - 1816.28s |  at the whims of the service provider
1816.28s - 1818.28s |  like Darth Vader did.
1818.28s - 1820.28s |  I have altered
1820.28s - 1822.28s |  the deal. Pray I don't alter it further.
1822.28s - 1824.28s |  Well,
1824.28s - 1826.28s |  Big Tech knows
1826.28s - 1828.28s |  that. That's why they came together
1828.28s - 1830.28s |  to create the Open Compute project.
1830.28s - 1832.28s |  As a bonus,
1832.28s - 1834.28s |  competition gives you a stronger
1834.28s - 1836.28s |  negotiating position and
1836.28s - 1840.87s |  reduces cost.
1840.87s - 1842.87s |  Three,
1842.87s - 1844.87s |  strengthen the commons.
1844.87s - 1846.87s |  Public money, public code.
1846.87s - 1851.62s |  Engage in demand that
1851.62s - 1853.62s |  the various levels of government
1853.62s - 1855.62s |  use their buying power to strongly
1855.62s - 1857.62s |  deliver public code.
1857.62s - 1859.62s |  I've seen this used to drive
1859.62s - 1861.62s |  better standards, competition, and resilience
1861.62s - 1863.62s |  throughout the years. I've seen this
1863.62s - 1865.62s |  multiplying effect with playing the Linux
1865.62s - 1867.62s |  Foundation, CESA, NIST, NASA,
1867.62s - 1872.76s |  and more. Switzerland's doing it.
1872.76s - 1876.26s |  A strong commons enables
1876.26s - 1878.26s |  us to not worry
1878.26s - 1880.26s |  about if the provider
1880.26s - 1882.26s |  is going to run pool a feature
1882.26s - 1884.26s |  that we rely on.
1884.26s - 1886.26s |  In cybersecurity, we often say
1886.26s - 1888.26s |  trust but verify.
1888.26s - 1890.26s |  Public code allows us to do
1890.26s - 1892.26s |  just that because, well,
1892.26s - 1894.26s |  mistakes happen. It also enables
1894.26s - 1896.26s |  us to keep the government
1896.26s - 1898.26s |  and its implementers accountable
1898.26s - 1900.26s |  as more gets digitized.
1900.26s - 1902.26s |  As a benefit,
1902.26s - 1904.26s |  public code helps create local capability.
1904.26s - 1906.26s |  When knowledge and
1906.26s - 1908.26s |  capability is publicly available,
1908.26s - 1910.26s |  we enable local providers
1910.26s - 1912.26s |  to grow, thus minimizing the
1912.26s - 1914.26s |  impact of external powers
1914.26s - 1916.26s |  have on our survival
1916.26s - 1919.67s |  and democracy. It's only fair
1919.67s - 1921.67s |  that if taxpayers are paying for it,
1921.67s - 1923.67s |  the taxpayer-paying community
1923.67s - 1928.48s |  should benefit, right?
1928.48s - 1930.48s |  Securing a supply chain and reversing
1930.48s - 1932.48s |  this digital fragility is a matter of survival.
1932.48s - 1936.15s |  It is about
1936.15s - 1938.15s |  our freedom to choose
1938.15s - 1940.15s |  and act independently.
1940.15s - 1942.15s |  Our digital life
1942.15s - 1946.07s |  is real life.
1946.07s - 1948.07s |  It's not going to be easy.
1948.07s - 1950.07s |  No large forces
1950.07s - 1953.67s |  against us,
1953.67s - 1955.67s |  but as John F. Kennedy
1955.67s - 1957.67s |  said about the moonshot,
1957.67s - 1959.67s |  we choose to go to the moon
1959.67s - 1961.67s |  in this decade and do other things,
1961.67s - 1963.67s |  not because they are easy
1963.67s - 1965.67s |  but because they are hard
1965.67s - 1967.67s |  because that goal
1967.67s - 1969.67s |  will serve to organize and measure
1969.67s - 1971.67s |  the best of our energies and skills.
1971.67s - 1975.08s |  This is our moonshot.
1975.08s - 1977.08s |  Are we willing to accept the challenge
1977.08s - 1979.08s |  and fight to it
1979.08s - 1981.08s |  or will we let this fragility shatter
1981.08s - 1984.52s |  our life's efforts and our future?
1984.52s - 1986.52s |  One small step at a time.
1986.52s - 1988.52s |  We will reclaim
1988.52s - 1991.96s |  our resilient future.
1991.96s - 2003.78s |  What will you do?
2003.78s - 2005.78s |  Thank you.
