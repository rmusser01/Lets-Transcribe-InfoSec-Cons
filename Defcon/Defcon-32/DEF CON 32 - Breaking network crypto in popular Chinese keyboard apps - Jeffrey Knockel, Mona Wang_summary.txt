**Overview of Chinese Keyboard Apps**

- Popular Chinese **IME keyboards** can act as **keyloggers**, transmitting keystrokes over the internet.
- **Affected keyboards** include Sogou IME, Baidu IME, and iFlytek IME.
- These apps use **cloud-based prediction** for character prediction.
- Over 800 million users are affected, with these keyboards being pre-installed on many devices.

**Security Concerns**

- Data is transmitted using **insecure proprietary cryptography**.
- The cryptographic methods are vulnerable to **network eavesdroppers**.
- Lack of proper encryption makes keystrokes readable by state actors and third parties.

**Threat Model**

- Some attacks require an **active network adversary**, while others only need a **passive adversary**.
- **Network eavesdropping** allows silent collection and decryption of keystrokes.

**Cryptographic Vulnerabilities**

- **Sogo** encryption suffers from a **CBC padding oracle attack**.
- **iFlytek** uses **DES in ECB mode**, making it insecure.
- **Baidu** initially used a weak proprietary AES, later updated to a still insecure protocol.

**Response and Mitigation**

- After disclosures, some companies, like Tencent and iFlytek, switched to **TLS**.
- **Baidu's** response was inadequate, opting for a **proprietary protocol** over TLS.

**Call to Action**

- Emphasize the need for **standard encryption protocols** like TLS.
- Encourage **cryptographers** to analyze and improve security in understudied app ecosystems.
- Highlight the systemic issue of **rolling proprietary cryptography** in Chinese apps.

**Conclusion**

- The global security community should pay more attention to **popular but understudied apps**.
- Developers and companies must be urged to adopt **secure cryptographic practices**.
- Advocate for **platform-level restrictions** to enforce secure network communications.
