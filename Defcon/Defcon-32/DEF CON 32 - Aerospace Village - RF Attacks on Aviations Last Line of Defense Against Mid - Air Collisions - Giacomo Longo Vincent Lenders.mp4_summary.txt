**Introduction to RF Attacks on Aviation**

- Presentation on **radio frequency attacks** targeting aviation's last defense against mid-air collisions.
- Focus on the **Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)**.
- Presented by **Vincent Lenders**, a cybersecurity researcher, and **Giacomo Longo**, a PhD student.

**Air Traffic Control Systems**

- **Air traffic control** is crucial for safe air travel and involves organizing and optimizing air traffic flow.
- **Key technologies**: Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR), Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADSP), and TCAS.
- **MODIS**: A data frame format for wireless communication between aircraft and ground stations.

**TCAS Overview**

- Essential for preventing mid-air collisions and mandatory for certain aircraft.
- **Functions of TCAS**: Surveillance, traffic advisory, and resolution advisories.
- **Resolution Advisory**: Commands given to pilots to avoid collisions, typically involving one aircraft climbing and the other descending.

**Security Concerns with TCAS**

- **Unencrypted communication**: TCAS protocol is from 1987, lacks encryption, and is insecure.
- **Potential attacks**: Inducing traffic advisories (TA) and resolution advisories (RA) without authentication.
- **Experimental analysis**: Lack of convincing evidence that attacks are feasible with commercial hardware.

**Technical Challenges and Mitigations**

- **Latency issues**: Difficult to perform attacks due to the short response time required (128 microseconds).
- **Testbed construction**: Required for testing attacks, involving TCAS units, control panels, SDRs, and avionic simulators.
- **Software-defined radio (SDR)**: Used to explore attack feasibility due to cost and complexity of dedicated hardware.

**Experimental Findings**

- Successfully triggered **TA and RA** using software-defined radio.
- **Sensitivity level attacks**: Possible to disable TCAS systems remotely.
- **Feasibility**: Achievable with approximately $10,000 in equipment and technical expertise.

**Conclusion and Future Implications**

- **Workstation improvements**: Will increase the capability to carry out attacks over time.
- **Standard vulnerabilities**: Identified systemic issues that require addressing in future standards.
- **Disclosure to manufacturers**: Highlighted the need for updates and improvements in collision avoidance systems.
