**Overview of Presentation**

- Presented by Jake Jepson and Rik Chatterjee, Systems Engineering Master's students at Colorado State University
- Focus on **Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs)** and their security implications in the trucking industry
- Discuss **cyber-physical threats** due to networked nature and lack of standardized security protocols
- Key vulnerabilities include insecure defaults and poor security practices
- Importance of research in **embedded systems security** and vehicle network protocols

**Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs) and Security**

- ELDs are integral for compliance with **Hours of Service** regulations
- Initially lacked security considerations in the 2017 mandate
- Around 880 different ELDs, with many being rebranded clones
- ELDs require **read and write access** to vehicle networks, posing risks if exploited

**Cybersecurity Research and Findings**

- Successful **wireless drive-by attack** on a truck using ELD vulnerabilities
- Discovery of insecure wireless networks (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) on ELDs
- Use of **Ghidra** and other tools for reverse engineering firmware
- Identification of **default network credentials** and unsecured firmware updates

**Proof of Concept and Vulnerabilities**

- Development of a malicious firmware capable of **truck-to-truck worm** propagation
- Vulnerabilities include **unsupervised write access**, lack of firmware signing, and weak passwords
- Potential for ELDs to be compromised wirelessly, leading to unauthorized vehicle control

**Implications and Call to Action**

- Highlighted the need for **industry-wide security reforms** and regulatory standards
- Emphasis on the importance of **coordinated vulnerability disclosure** and manufacturer response
- Discussion on the systemic issues with **self-certified devices** mandated by government
- Urgent call for improved security practices in an increasingly interconnected world
