2.51s - 10.43s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Newman Lim, also known as Skuzzy Death, is from DC-604 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
10.43s - 14.95s |  And actually, and he's also, and DC-416 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
14.95s - 15.99s |  Apparently, he gets around.
16.19s - 19.55s |  He's also behind me as a giant talking head from Zardoz.
20.27s - 22.63s |  Oh, no, it's his first slide.
22.81s - 27.85s |  Sorry, no longer a talking head.
28.45s - 35.29s |  This talk is going to be frontline first aid, triaging your deferred emergency response.
35.45s - 40.05s |  Digital forensics and incident response, as well as other essential emergency workers,
40.41s - 44.73s |  often face high stress levels and risk burnout due to their demanding roles.
45.05s - 46.09s |  I can relate to that.
46.09s - 47.45s |  I was in that role for a while.
47.89s - 52.73s |  This talk is for professionals, spouses, managers, and corporations, and we'll cover
52.73s - 59.33s |  the following topics, self-care, hacking health, maintaining work-life balance, building a
59.33s - 64.73s |  support network, and developing mindfulness and relaxation techniques, using technology
64.73s - 69.05s |  to manage workload, working with management to create a positive work environment.
69.41s - 73.73s |  Having built and led successful deferred practices that dealt with some of Canada's
73.73s - 79.65s |  largest data breaches, I wish to impart that I have, what I have learned over the years
79.65s - 83.65s |  so others may protect and nurture their most sacred resources, people.
84.49s - 91.85s |  Newman Lim is a manager at Odlam, not sure which, Brown, where he leads the defense against
91.85s - 95.69s |  criminals and state-sponsored actors targeting the financial industry.
95.97s - 100.41s |  Prior to this role, Newman spent several years working with large enterprises and
100.41s - 106.53s |  governments specializing in digital forensics and incident response, investigating some of
106.53s - 110.89s |  Canada's largest data breaches from 2018 to 2023.
111.25s - 116.13s |  With more than 15 years of InfoSec experience, he's delivered numerous cyber risk
116.13s - 121.85s |  assessments, coordinated national incident responses across multiple industries.
122.41s - 126.93s |  Newman has been invited to share his research and thought leadership at many security
126.93s - 134.81s |  conferences, such as Gray Hat, DEF CON Blue Team Village, HTCIA, B-Sides Toronto, and
134.81s - 139.09s |  CISO Summit and CCTX, and now DEF CON Groups VR.
139.25s - 141.49s |  So we'd like to welcome Newman to the stage.
145.10s - 146.22s |  Hey, thank you, everyone.
146.66s - 149.26s |  And it's good to be here.
149.26s - 152.42s |  I'm across the street from the main conference.
153.82s - 157.38s |  I'm just going to basically move on to my very first slide here.
158.02s - 159.46s |  And it's really just about myself.
159.90s - 162.54s |  I think the introduction was fantastic.
162.58s - 164.14s |  I couldn't have said it better myself.
165.14s - 173.70s |  Hopefully that will kind of set us up for the rest of this talk, where we really try to
173.70s - 181.90s |  focus on tips and strategies on how we as practitioners, as well as managers or corporate
182.30s - 190.26s |  leaders, look at this particular issue in a more serious way, as well as come out of this
190.42s - 196.94s |  talk with some good, you know, good statistics as well as strategies to kind of deal with the
196.94s - 200.70s |  problem. Because let's be honest, this is a problem that we're all trying to solve.
201.10s - 204.62s |  And I don't believe anyone has a very good idea of how to solve it.
206.50s - 210.70s |  So let's just start with, OK, well, why listen to this person chat about this?
211.30s - 218.50s |  I've been a digital forensics consultant for probably most of my career.
219.90s - 226.22s |  In 2018, I led CGI's digital forensics and incident response team.
226.62s - 233.06s |  I built that team as well as the digital forensics lab and in the Toronto area.
234.06s - 240.10s |  In 2019, I became the director of digital forensics and incident response at ISA.
241.02s - 247.62s |  And then after that, in 2023, I was the senior manager of detect and response, also doing
247.70s - 250.82s |  incident response for Deloitte, one of the big fours.
251.94s - 257.58s |  During that time, I've dealt with some of the largest data breaches, helped our clients with
257.78s - 264.54s |  not just the investigation, but also the remediation of some of these issues at hand.
267.76s - 276.96s |  One of the main things that I wanted to kind of talk about today is legally, without
276.96s - 283.00s |  prejudice, of course, here are just some headlines of some of the casework that I may or
283.00s - 284.04s |  may not have been involved.
291.57s - 299.21s |  As we know, this is a major, major industry problem, and burnout within the
299.21s - 303.57s |  cybersecurity industry is extremely high.
304.81s - 312.01s |  A lot of our peers, as you can see in some of these social posts from various times, I
312.01s - 317.49s |  think as far back as as 2021, have been talking about some of these issues that they've
317.49s - 320.65s |  been facing. And these are some notables in our industry.
321.85s - 323.85s |  Why is this such a major problem?
323.93s - 330.05s |  Well, first of all, the constant threats that we face, these don't go away.
330.05s - 332.09s |  In fact, they are getting worse.
333.13s - 338.21s |  And in some cases, you know, we're constantly dealing with evolving threats.
338.41s - 343.81s |  I mean, the nature of the job really means that we are always on high alert for new types
343.81s - 346.05s |  of attacks and vulnerabilities.
346.05s - 350.61s |  And therefore, you know, it's unbelievably mentally exhausting.
351.53s - 357.33s |  In some cases, either we're working for government agencies or hospitals, it's a high
357.33s - 358.33s |  stakes environment.
359.61s - 367.77s |  You know, the the consequences of a security breach can be increasingly severe, not just
367.77s - 375.41s |  impacting financial losses, but also, you know, you could also incur reputational damage
375.41s - 379.25s |  or legal repercussions, and in some cases, even the loss of life.
380.17s - 385.85s |  These high pressure environments contribute to a significant amount of stress, and
385.85s - 389.89s |  therefore the burnout problem is quite high in those industries.
391.57s - 397.41s |  Oftentimes, in order for us to stay ahead of the cyber threats, you know, practitioners
397.41s - 401.05s |  will work long hours, including long nights and weekends.
401.97s - 407.89s |  I mean, let's be honest, the bad guys don't, I mean, they themselves don't rest.
408.89s - 411.41s |  And they target people, you know, sometimes in the middle of the night.
413.37s - 419.45s |  So for that, we need to be constantly vigilant and in rapid response.
420.53s - 425.81s |  You know, most of the times it can be very disruptive to work life balance because, hey,
425.81s - 426.93s |  you could get hit at 3 a.m.
426.93s - 435.12s |  in the morning. Fourth one is I think we're no stranger to we all know there's a skills
435.24s - 440.80s |  shortage. It's difficult enough as it is to learn a lot of these investigative techniques.
441.88s - 449.28s |  There is a significant gap in the way that institutions such as universities or colleges
449.72s - 451.80s |  are teaching students today.
453.56s - 458.04s |  And they're not really catching up with the amount of knowledge and skills that are
458.04s - 462.44s |  required for what we need to do in the industry.
463.00s - 465.48s |  And therefore, the skill shortage just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
468.17s - 476.17s |  The complex and evolving threat landscape, as we know, the rapid pace of technology
476.17s - 481.49s |  change really means that cybersecurity professionals have to constantly update their
481.49s - 488.57s |  skills. Oftentimes, most folks will, you know, do a four year degree, take a science
488.57s - 490.09s |  course and.
491.17s - 496.69s |  Feel like that is enough for them to to leverage to build their career, and there's
496.69s - 504.21s |  nothing wrong with that, but that that type of of knowledge expires fairly quickly, given
504.21s - 511.49s |  how quickly things change, such as new technology, new new abilities in cloud technologies,
511.49s - 516.25s |  for example, as we start to move a lot of our on prem systems away from what we have
516.25s - 519.01s |  today to more modern technologies.
520.29s - 527.09s |  And so the the the threat of change creates a stressful environment.
528.93s - 535.65s |  And of course, incident response stress, as you well know, during cyber incidents, the
535.65s - 542.13s |  pressure to act quickly and efficiently is immense, the stress of managing and mitigating
542.13s - 549.81s |  cyber attacks, especially in the middle of one, often with a complete lack of resources.
549.81s - 554.13s |  And of course, the high stakes, especially if you're working for a hospital, can be
554.13s - 558.09s |  extremely draining, not just physically, but also mentally as well.
559.09s - 566.05s |  And last but not least, there's a huge lack of recognition and support for our industry.
567.13s - 571.41s |  Oftentimes I hear from practitioners, they keep saying things like, hey, this is a
571.41s - 576.25s |  unbelievably thankless job, and it keeps reflecting it in that in that way.
576.41s - 583.01s |  Organizations don't seem to recognize their staff enough that have worked all of these
583.01s - 589.56s |  long hours. So based on that, what can we do?
591.32s - 596.00s |  First things first, I just want us to call out my disclaimer, I'm not a medical
596.00s - 601.08s |  professional. The information and opinions that I'm providing here today is based on my
601.08s - 603.04s |  personal views and my experience.
604.04s - 608.88s |  If you are suffering from some medical condition, please make sure that you consult with a
608.88s - 610.36s |  qualified health care professional.
611.04s - 616.00s |  The content here is really for educational and informational purposes and should not be
616.32s - 619.96s |  substitute for professional medical advice and treatment.
622.49s - 626.89s |  So let's take a quick look at what is the definition of burnout.
627.45s - 636.33s |  And now the World Health Organization has defined burnout as a occupational phenomenon or
637.17s - 645.17s |  occupational. I wouldn't call it an illness, it's more of a condition, and it's actually
645.17s - 648.73s |  being recognized as a classification under diseases.
650.37s - 654.93s |  So it is what they would consider a medical phenomenon.
655.93s - 665.53s |  Burnout defined in ICA 11 is as follows, burnout is a syndrome conceptualized as a result
665.53s - 670.73s |  of chronic workplace stress that have not been successfully managed.
671.25s - 677.01s |  And that's the key word here that they're trying to flesh out here is that it has not been
677.01s - 678.25s |  successfully managed.
678.73s - 687.25s |  So that said, how can we as individuals, spouses, co-workers, managers manage this
687.25s - 693.77s |  successfully? So here the WHO has characterized three different dimensions.
694.17s - 700.25s |  The feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion, increased mental distance from one's jobs
700.25s - 703.73s |  feelings, the reduced professional advocacy.
703.81s - 706.53s |  Now, these are at a very high level.
706.77s - 708.05s |  Some of those symptoms.
709.05s - 715.41s |  But as part of my of my presentation, I will take you through a lot more different symptoms
715.41s - 719.17s |  on how to identify what could potentially constitute as burnout.
726.48s - 731.40s |  So here in Canada, I just want everyone to know that that organization, you have a
731.40s - 736.84s |  responsibility to their employees, especially the well-being of their employees.
737.88s - 741.24s |  And generally, these kind of fall into the following categories.
741.64s - 746.24s |  So organizations are responsible for creating healthy work environments.
746.48s - 751.64s |  We have physical safety requirements.
752.16s - 756.92s |  We have to ensure that the workplace is safe and free from hazards that could cause
756.92s - 763.40s |  physical harm. That said, there is also another category, what we call mental health
763.40s - 770.20s |  support. Organizations must foster a work environment that supports mental well-being
770.20s - 773.36s |  and reduce stigma around mental health issues.
777.51s - 782.79s |  Organizations in Canada also must provide resources and support, so we do have things
782.79s - 785.67s |  like employee assistance programs or EAPs.
786.23s - 788.35s |  I believe this is the same in the U.S.
788.35s - 796.67s |  as well. They must offer access to, sorry, they must offer access to counselling
796.67s - 800.07s |  services, mental health resources and support programs.
800.99s - 803.59s |  Here in Canada, we have something very special.
803.59s - 805.63s |  We call them mental health days.
806.39s - 810.79s |  We're allowed to take a number of days off specifically for mental health needs.
810.79s - 815.55s |  And that's been phenomenal because it does not take away from your sick days.
816.67s - 821.63s |  And our regular sick leave here in Canada is, sorry, in B.C.
821.63s - 823.39s |  in particular, is five days.
823.39s - 826.31s |  We're given five days of sick days.
826.55s - 828.67s |  And these mental health days are on top of that.
831.04s - 840.88s |  Workplaces must allow for reasonable working hours in order for staff members to manage
840.88s - 842.32s |  their workload and stress.
842.32s - 849.08s |  So employees or employers are regulated to maintain those.
850.20s - 851.52s |  Do they follow them?
851.52s - 855.24s |  I can tell you not too many do, but they are actually required to do so.
856.24s - 865.28s |  Stress management organizations are supposed to be following or allowing for the
865.28s - 869.68s |  implementation of practices and programs that will help employees manage and reduce
869.68s - 875.72s |  stress, such as providing training for stress management techniques.
877.20s - 884.24s |  And organizations must also promote work-life balance, and these could include things
884.72s - 887.32s |  like allowing for flexible work arrangements.
887.32s - 890.04s |  But again, not every organization follows this.
891.00s - 894.88s |  They must also allow for time off or have time off policies.
896.16s - 900.56s |  And I think most corporations do follow that particular guideline.
903.22s - 906.42s |  Organizations must also encourage open communications.
907.18s - 914.14s |  In this particular case, they must support a corporate culture that creates an
914.14s - 919.66s |  environment, a safe environment where employees feel comfortable discussing not just
919.66s - 922.38s |  their physical, but also their mental health concerns.
923.78s - 931.34s |  And they must also provide mechanisms to allow employees to voice concerns as well as
931.34s - 934.74s |  suggest improvements to those policies and programs.
936.50s - 940.82s |  One that is very important, and I can't stress enough, is really the training and
940.82s - 941.66s |  awareness piece.
942.54s - 948.42s |  Organizations are responsible for providing training for managers and employees as well
948.42s - 954.82s |  on how to recognize the signs of physical and mental health issues and also how that
954.82s - 956.18s |  they can get support and help.
956.86s - 963.30s |  So those EAP programs, for example, they need to have documentation as well as policies
963.30s - 966.18s |  and procedures to say, here's how you can access all of these.
968.62s - 974.26s |  There are some legal compliance in terms of what an organization is responsible for.
975.74s - 981.50s |  There are some federal and provincial or state regulations regarding workplace health and
981.50s - 990.38s |  safety. If you do not follow these, you can be ordered by the government to adhere or
991.26s - 993.22s |  or meet those standards.
993.50s - 1000.66s |  There are also accommodations given by law for employees with mental health conditions,
1000.66s - 1002.14s |  and these are required by law.
1002.22s - 1009.10s |  So, say, for example, if you have a staff member that has ADHD, for example, you must
1009.10s - 1011.30s |  allow for accommodations within your workplace.
1012.66s - 1015.26s |  And last but not least, employee engagement and support.
1015.26s - 1022.22s |  There must be supports provided for employees, for career development, as well as
1022.58s - 1023.62s |  recognition and reward.
1023.66s - 1028.74s |  Now, I can tell you a lot of companies don't actually follow that one, even though they
1028.74s - 1033.10s |  are in the guidelines from from an organization's responsibilities.
1033.74s - 1040.90s |  So of all of these that I've mentioned, I would say that most organizations probably
1040.94s - 1047.66s |  adhere to about 75 percent of them and they fall behind on about 25 percent of them.
1048.22s - 1057.50s |  So we really, as employees, need to keep our organizations honest and make sure that they
1057.50s - 1063.50s |  are doing what they have to do and following some of these legal guidelines.
1063.50s - 1079.28s |  One thing I want to stress is there is there is a a financial hit on having your employees
1079.28s - 1081.36s |  suffer from from burnout.
1083.24s - 1091.36s |  When I was building some of my different practices and in the big fours, we have a very
1091.36s - 1098.56s |  quick calculation for me to basically drum up support from senior leadership to support
1098.56s - 1101.32s |  staff members in the practice.
1101.88s - 1107.56s |  The on the left hand side, I've got a graph here that basically shows the ideal scenario for
1107.56s - 1115.52s |  growth by determining a small pod or small incident response work or a quick response team
1115.52s - 1122.52s |  of one senior with a couple of analysts following the train the trainer trainee model.
1122.52s - 1135.52s |  If this model works the way that it should, the economics behind that is a linear trajectory up.
1135.52s - 1144.04s |  And for every senior with three analysts, they can generate quite a lot of revenue with extremely
1144.04s - 1153.64s |  low cost as long as the seniors are providing most of the support to the junior analysts and there
1153.64s - 1161.52s |  is rotation amongst the resources so that you don't hit the burnout stage on the right hand side.
1161.72s - 1169.52s |  Is a more realistic model of what usually happens in a in a in a different practice.
1169.52s - 1177.52s |  So what happens is that the seniors or analysts start to burn out, they quit and or they leave the
1177.52s - 1183.52s |  organization incurring a significant opportunity cost.
1183.52s - 1192.52s |  And as such, organizations that suffer from this cannot take on any additional casework, causing
1192.52s - 1195.52s |  loss of potential revenue.
1195.52s - 1205.52s |  And if your senior quits in the middle of a case, there could be some potential reputational damage.
1205.52s - 1213.52s |  Typically, when I present to my leadership teams, I would have a lot more modeling behind it with
1213.52s - 1222.52s |  actual numbers, cost training, as well as how much a senior analyst or a consultant can actually
1222.52s - 1225.52s |  contribute to the organization.
1225.52s - 1228.52s |  So just this is just for illustrations purposes.
1228.52s - 1233.52s |  I want to show that, you know, in an ideal scenario, it can be sustainable.
1233.52s - 1236.52s |  It can be good business model.
1236.52s - 1243.52s |  And on the right hand side, the ideal is to basically avoid, you know, the loss of potential
1243.52s - 1245.52s |  revenue.
1246.52s - 1249.52s |  So here, I want to talk about the stress to performance.
1249.52s - 1255.52s |  Now, we have to understand that every individual has a different amount of capacity and a different
1255.52s - 1267.45s |  ability to handle or take on stress.
1267.45s - 1272.45s |  In this particular case, you're really starting to look at, you know, how do you handle stress?
1272.45s - 1274.45s |  How do you deal with it?
1274.45s - 1276.45s |  How do you deal with it?
1276.45s - 1278.45s |  How do you deal with it?
1279.45s - 1285.45s |  In this particular case, you're really starting to look at the optimal stress levels for each and
1285.45s - 1288.45s |  every one of your team members.
1288.45s - 1290.45s |  So I'll give you an example.
1290.45s - 1297.45s |  At the higher echelon or the bigger, the higher curve, that could be like a senior consultant.
1297.45s - 1301.45s |  They may have more experience.
1301.45s - 1304.45s |  They may have a better support structure.
1305.45s - 1313.45s |  They may have more capacity to handle the stressful situations.
1313.45s - 1318.45s |  A junior would maybe be at the lower curve.
1318.45s - 1323.45s |  They do not have the capacity to handle as much of the workload.
1323.45s - 1331.45s |  They tend to fall into, I guess, the stressful or the burnout stages a lot faster because their
1331.45s - 1337.45s |  curve is at a much lower intensity.
1337.45s - 1345.45s |  Now, in this particular model, what we're really trying to do is shift left as best as we can.
1345.45s - 1346.45s |  Right?
1346.45s - 1349.45s |  We really do not want to get into that red.
1349.45s - 1356.45s |  Red would be all the red flags that would basically cause someone to not function anymore.
1356.45s - 1359.45s |  And that's something that we are really trying to get out of.
1359.45s - 1366.45s |  If you start to see yourself in that stage, you really need to start looking at getting help.
1366.45s - 1373.45s |  Because once you start taking on too much stress, sometimes it will overload your system.
1373.45s - 1382.45s |  So the key here is to recognize where you are in this curve and try to bring yourself back left as best as you can.
1382.45s - 1384.45s |  So how can you do that?
1384.45s - 1395.45s |  And there are some methods that managers who are here that are attending this can implement in their organizations.
1395.45s - 1399.45s |  So here are some of the ways that you could do.
1399.45s - 1403.45s |  So what you could do is you could lead through some of this stress.
1403.45s - 1406.45s |  And the key here is point number five.
1406.45s - 1412.45s |  What you're trying to do is you're trying to shoot for that sustainable best effort.
1412.45s - 1413.45s |  Sorry about that.
1413.45s - 1414.45s |  Yeah.
1414.45s - 1421.45s |  And what you want to do throughout all of this is constantly check in with your staff members.
1421.45s - 1424.45s |  Be curious at what's going on in their lives.
1424.45s - 1426.45s |  Listen to them.
1426.45s - 1429.45s |  During that time, make sure you talk about stress.
1429.45s - 1431.45s |  Hey, how are people's stress levels going?
1431.45s - 1441.45s |  As part of this presentation, I put together a checklist, which I took from a partner of mine.
1441.45s - 1453.45s |  And the checklist is included as a PDF on the stage, I believe, on the right-hand side of the stage, so that this is something that you can download.
1453.45s - 1459.45s |  And it's really just a checklist for you to kind of go through what kind of stressors are in your life.
1459.45s - 1469.45s |  So as managers, I would highly recommend that you put together some similar checklist so that you can talk to your staff about how they're feeling.
1469.45s - 1472.45s |  What is their current stress level right now?
1472.45s - 1480.45s |  And having that conversation as open as possible will really start to reduce some of those stress levels and at least help you identify.
1480.45s - 1488.45s |  And then once you understand that there is an issue or a stress-related issue, that you can start to look at managing it.
1488.45s - 1497.45s |  As managers, and in some cases as part of the legal requirements or guidelines, it is your responsibility to manage your staff time as well.
1497.45s - 1503.45s |  So look at how many hours each staff member is putting into their projects.
1503.45s - 1509.45s |  Look at rotating them out if they are doing way too many hours per day.
1509.45s - 1518.45s |  And last but not least, really advocate and support for those EAP programs that will help reduce some of the stress.
1518.45s - 1522.45s |  And last but not least, really try to focus on that sustainable best.
1523.45s - 1536.80s |  So as employees or as people, how do we identify the stressors that will lead us to burnout?
1536.80s - 1539.80s |  Now, the WHO has given us three factors.
1539.80s - 1544.80s |  I think that is, I think, a very brief summary.
1544.80s - 1552.80s |  I'm going to go into a lot more areas here that will help you identify what could potentially be an indicator.
1553.80s - 1556.80s |  And the key here is really identifying those indicators.
1556.80s - 1569.80s |  If you can find or identify these indicators ahead of time, it will allow you to have some strategies or tips that you can basically try to move left and mitigate some of this before it becomes a major issue.
1571.80s - 1574.80s |  So the number one would be an emotional indicator.
1574.80s - 1582.80s |  So things like chronic fatigue or feelings of tiredness, lack of energy, you don't want to get up in the morning and go to work.
1582.80s - 1594.80s |  Those types of emotional indicators are very, very useful to identify that you are under stress and that you may potentially be facing a burnout situation.
1595.80s - 1605.80s |  Other physical indicators such as sleep deprivation, headaches, muscle pain, and in some cases, major illnesses.
1605.80s - 1613.80s |  And I can tell you from my own experience, I, in my second burnout, I actually had a doctor tell me that I need to stop working.
1613.80s - 1620.80s |  My health cannot take, you know, the 18 hours that I was pulling.
1621.80s - 1629.80s |  And, you know, a medical professional, when a medical professional tells you that, you know, your work is causing you or creating illness, you need to stop.
1631.80s - 1633.80s |  So that's my experience from that one.
1633.80s - 1645.80s |  If you are developing, you know, health problems related to your current work, you need to seek medical help.
1645.80s - 1648.80s |  And if the doctor tells you to stop, you've got to stop.
1648.80s - 1657.61s |  Other behavioral indicators, behavioral indicators, things like decreased performance.
1657.61s - 1666.61s |  As you start to work the long hours, there will be times where your performance will start to decrease.
1666.61s - 1671.61s |  And it's just a function of the ability for you to do things right.
1671.61s - 1673.61s |  It's economies of scale.
1673.61s - 1680.61s |  The longer hours you work, the more tired you become, the less, the poorer the quality of your work.
1681.61s - 1685.61s |  In some cases, the behavioral indicator is withdrawal.
1685.61s - 1689.61s |  Effectively, you're so tired, you just don't want to do any more work.
1689.61s - 1693.61s |  Or you would start to push work that you would normally do off to other colleagues.
1694.61s - 1697.61s |  So those are other indicators that you should be aware of.
1698.61s - 1701.61s |  Cognitive indicators, concentration.
1701.61s - 1704.61s |  And I can tell you that I've suffered from this quite a bit.
1704.61s - 1706.61s |  Someone would tell me something.
1706.61s - 1708.61s |  Typically, I have pretty good memory.
1708.61s - 1713.61s |  I would memorize it and I'd be able to bring it back out or regurgitate it, no problem.
1713.61s - 1719.61s |  If I'm overworked or stressed, I have difficulty remembering things.
1721.61s - 1724.61s |  And that's, like I said, another cognitive indicator.
1724.61s - 1730.61s |  As you start to tire, your brain just stops becoming very efficient.
1731.61s - 1734.61s |  The next other indicator changes in attitude.
1734.61s - 1738.61s |  Oftentimes, I have high-performance staff members.
1738.61s - 1740.61s |  And this is the same with me as well.
1740.61s - 1742.61s |  We're typically very high-performance folks.
1742.61s - 1745.61s |  We're very enthusiastic about the work that we do.
1745.61s - 1747.61s |  We want to keep hospitals safe.
1747.61s - 1749.61s |  We want to protect government agencies.
1749.61s - 1752.61s |  We're usually very enthusiastic about it.
1752.61s - 1758.61s |  But when we hit that, once we cross the middle line and start going towards the right-hand side,
1759.61s - 1761.61s |  our attitude starts to change.
1761.61s - 1763.61s |  We lose our enthusiasm.
1763.61s - 1766.61s |  We're not there 100% of the time.
1766.61s - 1770.61s |  Our interest in doing the work that we loved to do previously just isn't there anymore.
1770.61s - 1776.61s |  And again, that affects, like I said, our productivity and our work rate.
1776.61s - 1783.01s |  And the last parts of indicators are social indicators.
1785.01s - 1790.01s |  When you get tired, people get grumpy.
1790.01s - 1795.01s |  I am definitely one that happens too.
1797.01s - 1800.01s |  And that sometimes causes conflicts with others.
1800.01s - 1812.01s |  Because one word, one social cue, one physical sign, and it could create an argument.
1813.01s - 1816.01s |  That has happened before, and it will lead to conflict with others
1816.01s - 1821.01s |  or withdrawal from social activities because I'm just not feeling it.
1823.26s - 1826.26s |  Others would be, and the last one would be sort of the changes in work habits.
1826.26s - 1831.26s |  As you start to overwork, you're going to have a very difficult time
1831.26s - 1835.26s |  disassociating yourself from the work that you're doing.
1835.26s - 1839.26s |  And that is typical in most high-performance staff members.
1839.26s - 1841.26s |  They just can't let it go.
1841.26s - 1847.26s |  And as managers, as well as spouses, you need to really look and see if,
1847.26s - 1851.26s |  hey, are you missing all of your meals today,
1851.26s - 1855.26s |  just so that you can finish up the last log that you're analyzing?
1855.26s - 1862.26s |  Are you skipping out on going to bed today because you have to process another hard drive?
1864.26s - 1868.26s |  Sometimes, like I said, staff members, individuals,
1868.26s - 1871.26s |  they just want to push through and power through things.
1871.26s - 1876.26s |  And that is not ideal because it will increase stress and it will lead to burnout.
1876.26s - 1886.91s |  So what can we do to protect ourselves, to make ourselves better
1886.91s - 1891.91s |  and try to get away from the right side of that curve?
1892.91s - 1897.91s |  Well, there are five strategies that I'd like to share with you today.
1897.91s - 1899.91s |  First one is self-care.
1900.91s - 1902.91s |  Second one is hacking health.
1902.91s - 1910.91s |  And I can tell you that we have a lot of industry folks here that are 100% promoting that.
1911.91s - 1914.91s |  Third one is maintain a good work-life balance.
1914.91s - 1919.91s |  And this requires your organizations to be part of this.
1919.91s - 1922.91s |  And in some cases, it is their responsibility.
1922.91s - 1925.91s |  So you have to work with them and they have to work with you.
1925.91s - 1928.91s |  Fourth one is building a support network around yourself
1928.91s - 1934.91s |  that will help you gain the capacity and to increase your sustainable best.
1934.91s - 1941.91s |  And last but not least, relaxation techniques that help you deal with the current situation.
1941.91s - 1945.91s |  And I can tell you that I have used some of these techniques
1945.91s - 1949.91s |  and some of them are as simple as literally breathing deeply into a bag.
1950.91s - 1953.91s |  And it does help, as silly as it sounds.
1954.91s - 1958.41s |  So self-care techniques.
1959.41s - 1965.41s |  Well, I mean, some of this seems very straightforward.
1966.41s - 1970.41s |  But one is you need to understand and you need to identify
1970.41s - 1974.41s |  that you are suffering from stress first and foremost.
1975.41s - 1979.41s |  And you need to be aware of your own stress levels to get to a problem.
1980.41s - 1984.41s |  Second part is there are some things that you could do to prevent burnout.
1984.41s - 1986.41s |  So you need to take proactive steps.
1988.41s - 1994.41s |  We need to then establish routine because let's be honest, as human beings, we love routine.
1995.41s - 2001.41s |  And routine really helps us deal with things that come out of the ordinary.
2002.41s - 2005.41s |  So the more routine we have, the less surprises we have.
2006.41s - 2012.41s |  The less surprises we have, the easier it is for us to build capacity to deal with other things that come up.
2013.41s - 2020.41s |  And so the 1-3-5 rule or the 80-20 rule really comes into play
2020.41s - 2027.41s |  where 80% of your day is regulated routine and 20% of it could be emergencies.
2028.41s - 2033.41s |  And that would give you the capacity to deal with some issues, additional issues, that is.
2034.41s - 2038.41s |  I would like to also tell people to kind of practice mindfulness.
2039.41s - 2043.41s |  There is a whole slide on this one, but deep breathing, I find, is really helpful,
2044.41s - 2047.41s |  especially when you're dealing with a stressful situation.
2047.41s - 2052.41s |  So just take one second, take a deep breath, and then breathe out.
2053.41s - 2057.41s |  And it will help you think about what you're going to do next,
2058.41s - 2060.41s |  think about the strategies for the next little while.
2061.41s - 2065.41s |  And if you have already a healthy lifestyle,
2066.41s - 2072.41s |  that actually provides additional capacity for you to take on extra work or extra stressors in your life.
2072.41s - 2078.41s |  But if you do not already have a healthy lifestyle, it will actually exacerbate the problem at hand.
2079.41s - 2084.41s |  There is a technique to help us take regular breaks.
2085.41s - 2091.41s |  The Pomodoro technique has actually been implemented in some pieces of software.
2092.41s - 2099.41s |  And I can tell you that some of the forensic software have introduced some of this technique into the software for officer care.
2099.41s - 2102.41s |  And what this technique does is basically this.
2103.41s - 2108.41s |  When you choose or select a task that you work on, set a timer.
2109.41s - 2111.41s |  Say, for example, set a timer for 25 minutes.
2112.41s - 2113.41s |  And this is the traditional technique.
2114.41s - 2121.41s |  When that timer goes off, right, you can basically, I'm sorry, when the timer is on,
2122.41s - 2124.41s |  you're basically focusing on the task at hand.
2125.41s - 2128.41s |  Once the timer goes off, you take a five-minute break.
2129.41s - 2136.41s |  Whether the 25 minutes is good for your own self, that's up to you.
2137.41s - 2139.41s |  You can extend it. You can shorten it.
2140.41s - 2146.41s |  Some folks that I work with like to extend the 25 minutes to two hours, for example,
2147.41s - 2149.41s |  because it takes, say, two hours to process a hard drive.
2150.41s - 2152.41s |  So during that time, they're working.
2153.41s - 2155.41s |  Once that alarm goes off, they're off on a break.
2156.41s - 2158.41s |  Software can do that for you.
2159.41s - 2161.41s |  Your phones can be programmed to do that for you as well.
2162.41s - 2169.41s |  So I highly recommend people look at using technology to regulate your breaks
2170.41s - 2173.41s |  and to build that routine in there, as I mentioned earlier.
2174.41s - 2179.41s |  The next one is to obviously schedule your time off and vacation so that you can recharge.
2180.41s - 2183.41s |  You have to disassociate yourself from work responsibly.
2184.41s - 2185.41s |  You've got to disconnect.
2186.41s - 2187.41s |  I am guilty of this.
2187.41s - 2192.41s |  I have always not taken my vacations until the very last minute.
2193.41s - 2196.41s |  So I can tell you that from my own experience,
2197.41s - 2200.41s |  it's something that I really try to remind people to do
2201.41s - 2204.41s |  because I personally in the past have not done so.
2206.79s - 2210.79s |  And last but not least, if you can maintain and nurture good relationships
2211.79s - 2212.79s |  with your friends and families and colleagues,
2213.79s - 2215.79s |  the reason for that is that you need that social support.
2215.79s - 2221.79s |  You have to build this network so that if and when there's an anomaly in your behaviors,
2222.79s - 2224.79s |  they typically are the first to notice it,
2225.79s - 2228.79s |  and they typically are the first to raise the red flag around you.
2229.79s - 2235.79s |  And if it comes from family members, that alert, that notification isn't as harsh
2236.79s - 2241.79s |  as if a medical professional tells you that you've got a problem.
2241.79s - 2245.79s |  So it's better to have the early detection than to wait to the very last minute
2246.79s - 2248.79s |  when things are starting to fall apart and you're too far to the right,
2249.79s - 2251.79s |  that it becomes a serious issue.
2252.79s - 2253.79s |  Next, I want to talk about hacking health.
2259.91s - 2265.91s |  Now, in our industry, there has been a lot of groups and movement towards hacking health.
2266.91s - 2271.91s |  And so these are actually, you know, very fun events if you've got the time.
2271.91s - 2277.91s |  And I think I feel like you do need to specify and build the time to do this,
2278.91s - 2279.91s |  dedicate the time to do this.
2280.91s - 2284.91s |  And it can be as simple as basically choosing an exercise that you like to do.
2285.91s - 2287.91s |  Things like walking, for example.
2288.91s - 2294.91s |  So instead of, I don't know, playing an extreme sport,
2295.91s - 2298.91s |  I can opt to take a 15-minute walk around my office building.
2298.91s - 2301.91s |  Because I enjoy taking a walk and it relaxes me.
2302.91s - 2305.91s |  And I'm not thinking about work during the time that I'm taking this walk.
2306.91s - 2312.91s |  Other areas that you should also think about is what is the intensity level?
2313.91s - 2319.91s |  So regular, moderated exercise is typically more beneficial for stress management
2320.91s - 2322.91s |  than the occasional very, very intense workouts.
2322.91s - 2329.91s |  So again, back to that routine, build the regular exercise into your health routine
2330.91s - 2331.91s |  so that you can really reduce the stress levels.
2332.91s - 2336.91s |  And last but not least, simple one is just listen to your body, right?
2337.91s - 2343.91s |  So if you overdo things, you're actually creating more stress for yourself.
2344.91s - 2348.91s |  Say, for example, you did an intense workout and you injure yourself.
2348.91s - 2350.91s |  And the next day you have to respond to an IR.
2351.91s - 2353.91s |  You're not doing yourself a service.
2355.91s - 2357.91s |  Last but not least, squat up.
2358.91s - 2360.91s |  Again, think about building that support network.
2361.91s - 2366.91s |  So there are groups out there that promote this, such as Blue Team Fit, Defer Fit,
2367.91s - 2368.91s |  even here at DEF CON.
2369.91s - 2373.91s |  The DEF CON run was done, I think, a couple of mornings ago.
2373.91s - 2377.91s |  And just today on the conference floor, I bumped into a new group,
2378.91s - 2382.91s |  or at least a new group to me, which is the Hacking Your Health group.
2383.91s - 2386.91s |  And their website is HackingYourHealth.com.
2387.91s - 2392.91s |  So again, there are many groups out there that promote this.
2393.91s - 2398.91s |  And I think the best notable in our industry for this is Hacking Dave.
2398.91s - 2403.91s |  And he posts a lot about his workouts and how he hacks health
2404.91s - 2406.91s |  while running a cybersecurity company.
2407.91s - 2411.91s |  Highly recommend that you follow him and you look at the things that he's been doing.
2412.91s - 2414.91s |  And last but not least, post your successes.
2415.91s - 2417.91s |  Hey, I've done a workout today.
2418.91s - 2422.91s |  You know, I ran two miles on the threat mill.
2423.91s - 2424.91s |  I've taken a 15-minute walk.
2424.91s - 2425.91s |  Post it.
2426.91s - 2427.91s |  Revel in your success.
2428.91s - 2433.91s |  Like, we need the achievements to lower our stress levels.
2434.91s - 2435.91s |  Work-life balance.
2436.91s - 2443.71s |  I feel like we talk about work-life balance a lot.
2444.71s - 2448.71s |  And this one is, again, you know, pretty straightforward.
2450.71s - 2456.71s |  We do need to look at marrying what organizations are responsible for.
2456.71s - 2459.71s |  Marrying what organizations are responsible for.
2460.71s - 2462.71s |  And keeping our organizations honest.
2463.71s - 2468.71s |  So, as an employee, absolutely, you've got to start setting work limits,
2469.71s - 2471.71s |  if possible, within your environment.
2472.71s - 2473.71s |  Make sure there are clear boundaries.
2474.71s - 2476.71s |  One really good one is cell phones.
2477.71s - 2481.71s |  I personally force my company to always pay for a work phone.
2482.71s - 2484.71s |  And my personal phone is my personal phone.
2484.71s - 2488.71s |  What I do is, for work, if I am on call, I would have the phone on.
2489.71s - 2491.71s |  If I'm not on call, it stays off.
2492.71s - 2494.71s |  And that way, if anybody needs to reach me,
2495.71s - 2499.71s |  I have processes in place to say, call my second-in-command.
2500.71s - 2501.71s |  You're not talking to me.
2502.71s - 2504.71s |  You're talking to the other individuals that is on call.
2505.71s - 2506.71s |  And learn to say no.
2507.71s - 2509.71s |  I feel like, as high-performance individuals,
2510.71s - 2511.71s |  learning to say no is difficult for us.
2511.71s - 2514.71s |  But you really have to protect your time and your energy.
2515.71s - 2516.71s |  And you've got to decline things.
2517.71s - 2518.71s |  I've talked to my bosses in the past,
2519.71s - 2521.71s |  where I say, do we really need to take on this case?
2522.71s - 2525.71s |  Most of our team is already engaged on an engagement.
2526.71s - 2528.71s |  If we add this to them, we have no capacity
2529.71s - 2530.71s |  to deal with other emergencies that may arise.
2531.71s - 2533.71s |  So, again, back to that 80 to 20% rule.
2534.71s - 2537.71s |  Effectively, I'm telling my boss, we are at 80.
2538.71s - 2539.71s |  If you want us to take on anything else,
2539.71s - 2541.71s |  there's a chance that if something comes sideways at us,
2542.71s - 2544.71s |  we have no capability to deal with.
2545.71s - 2546.71s |  Plan your day.
2547.71s - 2548.71s |  Start to look at routines, right?
2549.71s - 2550.71s |  Use calendars.
2551.71s - 2552.71s |  Use task management applications.
2553.71s - 2554.71s |  There are tons of these things out there now
2555.71s - 2558.71s |  that effectively can schedule all eight hours of your day
2559.71s - 2560.71s |  very easily.
2561.71s - 2563.71s |  And if you start seeing things start to overflow from those,
2564.71s - 2565.71s |  you know you're stretched.
2565.71s - 2568.71s |  Always look at setting long-term and short-term goals,
2569.71s - 2571.71s |  both for your work and personal life.
2572.71s - 2574.71s |  I typically have weekly meetings with my staff members
2575.71s - 2576.71s |  to look at the short-term goals,
2577.71s - 2578.71s |  things that we can win very easily,
2579.71s - 2581.71s |  and as well as long-term projects and goals
2582.71s - 2586.71s |  to try to keep things organized and in a routine.
2587.71s - 2589.71s |  We're not getting things coming out of the woodwork
2590.71s - 2591.71s |  and scaring us or, you know,
2592.71s - 2593.71s |  having emergency work for no apparent reason.
2593.71s - 2595.71s |  Try to schedule it as far ahead as we can.
2596.71s - 2597.71s |  Communications, obviously.
2598.71s - 2599.71s |  You need to communicate all of these things.
2600.71s - 2602.71s |  If you don't feel like you're capable of doing the work,
2603.71s - 2604.71s |  let your employees know,
2605.71s - 2606.71s |  let your organization know,
2607.71s - 2609.71s |  so they can provide you the adequate training
2610.71s - 2611.71s |  to be able for you to do the job.
2612.71s - 2614.71s |  Supports such as the EAP programs
2615.71s - 2616.71s |  and the wellness initiatives.
2617.71s - 2620.71s |  I hope companies are providing those
2620.71s - 2623.71s |  to their employees because that's very key.
2624.71s - 2626.71s |  There's many times where I would utilize
2627.71s - 2628.71s |  some of these programs
2629.71s - 2631.71s |  so that I can seek medical or psychological help.
2632.71s - 2634.71s |  And so those are very important programs,
2635.71s - 2636.71s |  and I 100% want to make sure
2637.71s - 2639.71s |  that you check out what you're entitled for
2640.71s - 2642.71s |  within your organization's benefit plans.
2643.71s - 2647.71s |  The last two here are really for my own personal experience.
2647.71s - 2649.71s |  Dealing with digital forensics and response.
2650.71s - 2653.71s |  Perfection is something that we do strive for.
2654.71s - 2657.71s |  However, it may be unrealistic,
2658.71s - 2661.71s |  or at least we may set unrealistic standards for yourself.
2662.71s - 2664.71s |  So really set achievable goals
2665.71s - 2668.71s |  and then try to avoid things that you cannot achieve.
2669.71s - 2671.71s |  Next, try to simplify your life.
2672.71s - 2674.71s |  If you have a singular task, singular goal,
2674.71s - 2675.71s |  try to focus on those.
2676.71s - 2678.71s |  Too often, I find folks try to multitask
2679.71s - 2681.71s |  or juggle a number of different things at the same time.
2682.71s - 2685.71s |  And those tend to fall apart pretty quickly.
2686.71s - 2689.71s |  Now, not to say that you can't multitask.
2690.71s - 2692.71s |  I've seen some folks do it very well.
2693.71s - 2694.71s |  This is just coming from myself.
2695.71s - 2696.71s |  I'm not a good multitasker.
2697.71s - 2704.06s |  The next one is to really build a support network.
2705.06s - 2707.06s |  So you really need to identify
2707.06s - 2710.06s |  key members who are supporters of yourselves,
2711.06s - 2712.06s |  allies of yourselves.
2713.06s - 2716.06s |  I find that family really helps in this particular case.
2717.06s - 2718.06s |  As you can see on the right here,
2719.06s - 2721.06s |  from a quote from John Sullivan,
2722.06s - 2724.06s |  his kids were his first indicator
2725.06s - 2727.06s |  when they notified him that,
2728.06s - 2729.06s |  hey, you're grumpy.
2730.06s - 2731.06s |  And the first thing he did was unplug.
2732.06s - 2734.06s |  That said, like I said,
2734.06s - 2737.06s |  there is other folks that will support you.
2738.06s - 2739.06s |  Friends, colleagues,
2740.06s - 2743.06s |  they typically are the first to notice things off about you,
2744.06s - 2746.06s |  and they will tell you in a nice way.
2747.06s - 2748.06s |  Open communication.
2749.06s - 2751.06s |  So try to be as open and honest and transparent
2752.06s - 2754.06s |  with your peers and your friends and your family members.
2755.06s - 2760.06s |  If you don't tell them that you're feeling down,
2761.06s - 2764.06s |  it's a lot harder for them to get you help.
2766.06s - 2768.06s |  Participate in professional networks.
2769.06s - 2771.06s |  So join associations like DEF CON, DEF CON groups.
2772.06s - 2774.06s |  If you're not feeling well,
2775.06s - 2776.06s |  feel free to talk to somebody there.
2778.47s - 2780.47s |  The rest, I think, are pretty straightforward.
2781.47s - 2783.47s |  So take a look at regular check-ins,
2784.47s - 2786.47s |  look at your company's EAP programs,
2787.47s - 2788.47s |  seek professional help.
2788.47s - 2791.47s |  If you're feeling like you're on the right-hand side of those curves,
2792.47s - 2794.47s |  if you need counseling or therapy,
2795.47s - 2797.47s |  I highly recommend that you seek those professionals out
2798.47s - 2799.47s |  and get a professional assessment.
2800.47s - 2802.47s |  Last but not least, talk to a career coach.
2803.47s - 2805.47s |  Maybe there is something in your personal life
2806.47s - 2808.47s |  or maybe your career that could require some adjusting
2809.47s - 2811.47s |  in order for you to manage and reduce your stress levels.
2812.47s - 2818.28s |  This is the last part of my presentation.
2819.28s - 2821.28s |  I find these work really well for me.
2822.28s - 2827.28s |  Especially when I'm in the middle of a 12- to 18-hour day,
2828.28s - 2831.28s |  I'm on calls with government officials,
2832.28s - 2835.28s |  everything's on fire, or hospital CEOs.
2836.28s - 2839.28s |  Breathing exercises is huge for me.
2840.28s - 2843.28s |  Taking a deep breath and then breathing out slowly
2844.28s - 2846.28s |  and just thinking about what to do next
2847.28s - 2850.28s |  is one that I find very, very useful.
2850.28s - 2854.28s |  Another one is the progressive massage relaxation technique.
2855.28s - 2857.28s |  What it means is I'm tensing all the muscles,
2858.28s - 2859.28s |  typically in my shoulder and my neck.
2860.28s - 2862.28s |  I tense it really, really hard, and then I relax them.
2863.28s - 2865.28s |  And I do that for about 10 times.
2866.28s - 2868.28s |  And after I've done that,
2869.28s - 2871.28s |  it seems to bring my stress levels down.
2872.28s - 2875.28s |  Meditation, not thinking about work,
2876.28s - 2878.28s |  thinking about maybe my last vacation,
2878.28s - 2880.28s |  visualizing that vacation,
2881.28s - 2883.28s |  also helps me not think about the stress
2884.28s - 2885.28s |  that I have to deal with at work.
2886.28s - 2887.28s |  Yoga is a pretty straightforward one.
2888.28s - 2890.28s |  I've been dragged to yoga many times by HR folks.
2891.28s - 2894.28s |  I find it very helpful just to be at those classes
2895.28s - 2896.28s |  and not think about work.
2897.28s - 2899.28s |  Self-massage, I have a Terragon.
2900.28s - 2901.28s |  I use it often.
2902.28s - 2904.28s |  If you're sitting in front of a computer staring at a screen,
2905.28s - 2907.28s |  I guarantee you your arms and your shoulders hurt a lot.
2908.28s - 2909.28s |  You might want to use that.
2910.28s - 2911.28s |  It's awesome.
2912.28s - 2914.28s |  Aromatherapy, my wife has introduced me to this.
2915.28s - 2916.28s |  Lavender is awesome.
2917.28s - 2918.28s |  And if you've got one of those little machines
2919.28s - 2922.28s |  that puff out the steam as well as the lavender smells, amazing.
2923.28s - 2926.28s |  That basically concludes my presentation for today.
2927.28s - 2929.28s |  If there are any questions, I am available.
2930.28s - 2933.28s |  But before I go, I will leave you with some external resources.
2934.28s - 2936.28s |  The self-care checklist is attached,
2936.28s - 2937.28s |  and on the side of this stage,
2938.28s - 2940.28s |  feel free to download it and use it for yourself.
2941.28s - 2945.28s |  Now, why are we not using some resources
2946.28s - 2947.28s |  that are already available to us?
2948.28s - 2951.28s |  Well, I don't know why our industry doesn't do that,
2952.28s - 2954.28s |  but you can take a look at what first responders,
2955.28s - 2958.28s |  such as paramedics, firefighters, have already in place.
2959.28s - 2962.28s |  So the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
2963.28s - 2965.28s |  actually has a guide to managing stress
2966.28s - 2967.28s |  for those types of first responders.
2968.28s - 2970.28s |  We can learn lessons from their guide.
2971.28s - 2973.28s |  That said, the Canadian Red Cross
2974.28s - 2976.28s |  and the Canadian Mental Health Association
2977.28s - 2979.28s |  have a number of indexes and quizzes
2980.28s - 2983.28s |  that you can utilize to gauge and identify your stresses.
2984.28s - 2986.28s |  Again, if you can identify your stress,
2987.28s - 2989.28s |  you can then plan and manage it.
2991.84s - 2992.84s |  So that's all I have for you today.
2993.84s - 2996.84s |  If you have any questions, I am around to answer them.
2997.84s - 3002.15s |  Thank you for an excellent presentation.
3012.94s - 3014.94s |  For those who might want those slides,
3015.94s - 3017.94s |  where they're posted is right here on this wall,
3018.94s - 3027.92s |  the wall to my right here on the side of the wall.
3028.92s - 3031.92s |  There's three documents there you can click on and view
3032.92s - 3034.92s |  and download them if you'd like.
3035.92s - 3036.92s |  Any questions for our speakers?
3046.76s - 3047.76s |  Quick question.
3048.76s - 3051.76s |  In your research, have you come across any statistics
3051.76s - 3058.76s |  on drug and alcohol abuse as it relates to incident responders?
3059.76s - 3060.76s |  So here's an interesting one.
3061.76s - 3065.76s |  We actually haven't had a chance to collect statistics and evidence
3066.76s - 3070.76s |  for digital forensics and incident response personnel.
3071.76s - 3073.76s |  Now, if you look at the first responder groups,
3074.76s - 3077.76s |  such as police, fire, they actually do collect that.
3077.76s - 3081.76s |  Now, here's my challenge to you for the industry.
3082.76s - 3088.76s |  We really do need to have that sort of industry statistic and metrics
3089.76s - 3093.76s |  for us to be able to better deal with this situation that we have.
3094.76s - 3097.76s |  Because I can tell you that once we start getting those numbers,
3098.76s - 3100.76s |  it may be quite alarming.
3101.76s - 3122.20s |  I'm curious if there's any initiative to help the general public
3122.20s - 3126.20s |  as we become more and more dependent upon technology in our daily lives.
3127.20s - 3131.20s |  Are we looking at the impact these cyber crimes and incidents
3132.20s - 3136.20s |  and outages have on the general public, especially our young folks?
3137.20s - 3139.90s |  Oh, good question.
3140.90s - 3145.90s |  I think the impacts haven't crossed into the general public just yet.
3146.90s - 3148.90s |  I think they are secondary impacts.
3149.90s - 3151.90s |  The main impact would be to the direct organization
3151.90s - 3155.90s |  that have been hit by or that have suffered the cyber crime.
3156.90s - 3162.08s |  The most direct one would be obviously the financial impact.
3163.08s - 3169.08s |  Say, for example, if the bad guys ransomwared a financial institution.
3170.08s - 3177.60s |  Right. I'm thinking generalized anxiety about,
3178.60s - 3179.60s |  is the hospital system going to fail?
3180.60s - 3182.60s |  Is 911 going to fail again?
3182.60s - 3188.60s |  Are we looking at the impact of when 911 goes down?
3189.60s - 3190.60s |  How does that affect our community?
3191.60s - 3192.60s |  Are we offering resources?
3193.60s - 3194.60s |  Are we addressing that?
3195.60s - 3197.60s |  Are we allowing it to be one of those, I believe you talked about,
3198.60s - 3200.60s |  kind of like a suppressed stress?
3201.60s - 3204.60s |  Are we paying attention to that and monitoring it?
3205.60s - 3208.60s |  So, it's an interesting question you ask because in Canada,
3209.60s - 3211.60s |  we actually did have a 911 outage.
3212.60s - 3213.60s |  It wasn't a cyber attack.
3214.60s - 3215.60s |  It was actually an IT issue.
3216.60s - 3223.60s |  But 911 services was offline to Canadians across the country.
3224.60s - 3227.60s |  And yes, it does increase the stress levels.
3228.60s - 3233.60s |  In fact, it created some issues for people who were needing those services.
3234.60s - 3239.60s |  Do we have, like I said, research and statistics on it?
3239.60s - 3240.60s |  I don't know.
3241.60s - 3243.60s |  I don't believe there is any that has been captured.
3244.60s - 3248.60s |  But the impact of that outage was very significant.
3253.66s - 3255.66s |  Thank you. I hope we consider things like that in the future
3256.66s - 3259.66s |  and put forth resources into that type of research.
3260.66s - 3261.66s |  Because as we become more dependent upon it,
3262.66s - 3265.66s |  it isn't impacting our lives when systems fail.
3266.66s - 3268.66s |  I 100% agree with you.
3269.66s - 3271.66s |  And having talks like this is really to raise that awareness.
3271.66s - 3275.66s |  And we need to all collectively start asking questions
3276.66s - 3277.66s |  to our government agencies.
3278.66s - 3280.66s |  Hey, are we doing this? And are we doing this right?
3342.65s - 3344.65s |  Our next speaker will be up in about 15 minutes.
3356.12s - 3358.12s |  A bunch of wonderful topics.
3359.12s - 3361.12s |  Wow, I'm like bedazzled over here.
3362.12s - 3366.36s |  Yeah, and if there's any sections that you missed
3367.36s - 3370.36s |  or would like to be able to pause and fast forward and rewind,
3371.36s - 3372.36s |  this is available on YouTube.
3372.36s - 3375.36s |  So this entire event is streamed to YouTube,
3376.36s - 3377.36s |  and you can watch it there.
3430.10s - 3431.10s |  Just thinking on that a little more,
3432.10s - 3435.10s |  talking about the economic impact of the stress and anxiety
3436.10s - 3438.10s |  that, you know, we'll just say tech situations
3439.10s - 3442.10s |  or tech outages in general can cause.
3443.10s - 3448.10s |  You know, it really is not talked about enough
3449.10s - 3453.10s |  when we look at things like attrition and losing employees and such.
3454.10s - 3458.10s |  And how often, you know, our tech issues
3459.10s - 3462.10s |  are relating to that kind of mental fatigue.
3463.10s - 3464.10s |  But it really is very interesting.
3465.10s - 3466.10s |  I appreciate you having a talk about it.
3467.10s - 3469.10s |  It is something that we need to encourage people to think more on.
3470.10s - 3473.10s |  Yeah, and I think there needs to be more research on this.
3474.10s - 3478.10s |  My ultimate goal here is to try to get,
3479.10s - 3480.10s |  not just government agencies,
3481.10s - 3483.10s |  I feel like government agencies can't really help us with this.
3484.10s - 3486.10s |  The industry itself has to come together
3487.10s - 3490.10s |  and look at perhaps putting together a framework
3491.10s - 3492.10s |  for us to work on.
3493.10s - 3494.10s |  And if the framework is successful,
3495.10s - 3496.10s |  it may turn into a standard.
3497.10s - 3499.10s |  Like, let's be honest, there are so many frameworks out there
3500.10s - 3501.10s |  in cybersecurity.
3502.10s - 3503.10s |  We should have one that basically says,
3504.10s - 3507.10s |  let's look at stress reduction.
3508.10s - 3510.10s |  Let's look at burnout prevention frameworks
3511.10s - 3513.10s |  so that we can save our staff members.
3514.10s - 3515.10s |  Let's be honest.
3516.10s - 3517.10s |  Without our people, we can't make money.
3522.84s - 3523.84s |  Very true.
3524.84s - 3526.84s |  I'm glad someone finally admitted that.
3527.84s - 3532.52s |  Hey, you're done.
3533.52s - 3540.04s |  Yeah, I wanted to ask about the mindfulness
3541.04s - 3542.04s |  and staying calm and everything.
3543.04s - 3545.04s |  What happens to someone who's located in a country
3546.04s - 3547.04s |  at a war?
3548.04s - 3551.04s |  Like, just feeling that major anxiety
3552.04s - 3553.04s |  over something you can't really control.
3553.04s - 3555.04s |  How can you maintain balance in that situation?
3556.04s - 3557.04s |  Do you have any thoughts?
3559.74s - 3560.74s |  That's a tough question.
3561.74s - 3562.74s |  Yeah, I know. Sorry.
3563.74s - 3564.74s |  No, it's good.
3565.74s - 3566.74s |  I actually have a friend.
3567.74s - 3568.74s |  He's Ukrainian.
3569.74s - 3570.74s |  Yeah, exactly.
3571.74s - 3572.74s |  I'm talking about situations like that.
3573.74s - 3574.74s |  He's got similar...
3575.74s - 3576.74s |  You don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.
3577.74s - 3579.74s |  So how do you make long-term plans
3580.74s - 3581.74s |  when you don't know if you're going to lose your legs tomorrow
3582.74s - 3583.74s |  or something? I don't know.
3584.74s - 3585.74s |  No, I 100% agree with you.
3586.74s - 3588.74s |  And I feel like if you have an employee
3589.74s - 3591.74s |  that has either family members
3592.74s - 3594.74s |  or are impacted by war,
3595.74s - 3597.74s |  I would say that you should try to be closer to them.
3598.74s - 3599.74s |  Be part of their support network.
3600.74s - 3602.74s |  If you start seeing things
3603.74s - 3604.74s |  or their behavior change,
3605.74s - 3606.74s |  reach out to them and find out.
3607.74s - 3608.74s |  You could find out that, hey,
3609.74s - 3610.74s |  they just found out some bad news
3611.74s - 3613.74s |  from their country that maybe a family member got killed.
3614.74s - 3615.74s |  And you should just be there for them.
3623.30s - 3625.30s |  Our heart definitely goes out to everyone
3626.30s - 3627.30s |  struggling in war.
3628.30s - 3631.12s |  Sorry, someone else was speaking.
3632.12s - 3633.12s |  I didn't want to interrupt. Go ahead.
3634.12s - 3635.12s |  No, I just wanted to say
3636.12s - 3638.12s |  it's one of the most simplest answers
3639.12s - 3640.12s |  you can think of,
3641.12s - 3642.12s |  but there's probably nothing more helpful than that.
3643.12s - 3644.12s |  Just lending an ear,
3645.12s - 3646.12s |  I guess a shoulder.
3647.12s - 3648.12s |  Yeah.
3649.12s - 3651.12s |  And humans are complex,
3651.12s - 3653.12s |  but I feel like there are some simple solutions
3654.12s - 3656.12s |  such as being part of their support structure,
3657.12s - 3658.12s |  just being there for them.
3659.12s - 3661.12s |  And if you're the employer, for example,
3662.12s - 3664.12s |  look at providing them some assistance
3665.12s - 3666.12s |  in terms of time off or long-term disability,
3667.12s - 3668.12s |  that sort of thing, so that they can go
3669.12s - 3672.12s |  and potentially deal with the issues at hand,
3673.12s - 3675.12s |  such as seeking medical help or psychosocial help.
3676.12s - 3680.07s |  Okay. Thank you.
3681.07s - 3682.07s |  From a research perspective,
3682.07s - 3683.07s |  do we have any data on,
3684.07s - 3685.07s |  you know, I don't know about y'all,
3686.07s - 3687.07s |  but I work in tech.
3688.07s - 3689.07s |  I work from home.
3690.07s - 3691.07s |  We are dependent upon a number of tools.
3692.07s - 3693.07s |  Anytime there's a tool outage
3694.07s - 3695.07s |  and it affects my employees' ability
3696.07s - 3697.07s |  to do their job,
3698.07s - 3699.07s |  it's a high-stress environment.
3700.07s - 3701.07s |  I would love to see those protocols
3702.07s - 3703.07s |  you were talking about in research
3704.07s - 3705.07s |  on developing skills and techniques
3706.07s - 3707.07s |  to help us in management be able to,
3708.07s - 3709.07s |  you know, offer the employees
3710.07s - 3711.07s |  some relief during these periods
3712.07s - 3713.07s |  of time, because of course we're,
3714.07s - 3715.07s |  you know, we're building bridges.
3716.07s - 3717.07s |  We're doing everything we can
3718.07s - 3719.07s |  to get these tools back online.
3720.07s - 3721.07s |  But it is highly stressful,
3722.07s - 3723.07s |  and we probably should have some,
3724.07s - 3725.07s |  you know, procedures in place
3726.07s - 3728.07s |  to help them deal with the stress of it as well.
3729.07s - 3730.07s |  Yeah. I find that,
3731.07s - 3732.07s |  so, for example, when we looked
3733.07s - 3734.07s |  at what happened with CrowdStrike,
3735.07s - 3736.07s |  when teams, IT teams,
3737.07s - 3738.07s |  were working around the clock
3739.07s - 3740.07s |  to restore some of these systems,
3740.07s - 3741.07s |  if you have the capacity
3742.07s - 3743.07s |  of people, for example,
3744.07s - 3745.07s |  you're able to rotate teams out,
3746.07s - 3747.07s |  that's probably the most ideal.
3748.07s - 3749.07s |  But if you don't have
3750.07s - 3751.07s |  that particular capacity,
3752.07s - 3753.07s |  then look at either bringing
3754.07s - 3755.07s |  additional or third-party help in
3756.07s - 3757.07s |  at a moment's notice.
3758.07s - 3760.07s |  Again, a lot of this requires preparation, right?
3761.07s - 3763.07s |  And that's one of the topics here as well,
3764.07s - 3765.07s |  is to kind of build that capacity
3766.07s - 3767.07s |  ahead of time, be a bit more prepared
3767.07s - 3769.07s |  by having some of these support structures in place
3770.07s - 3771.07s |  before you have an emergency,
3772.07s - 3773.07s |  and try not to overload your team already,
3774.07s - 3775.07s |  so try to keep them at 80%,
3776.07s - 3777.07s |  as opposed to 100%.
3778.07s - 3779.07s |  I talk about these as in,
3780.07s - 3781.07s |  you know, they seem like luxuries,
3782.07s - 3783.07s |  but if we plan ahead
3784.07s - 3785.07s |  and do things right,
3786.07s - 3787.07s |  then we should be at that point.
3788.07s - 3789.07s |  But I understand that, you know,
3790.07s - 3791.07s |  emergencies, things come out of us
3792.07s - 3793.07s |  from the side.
3794.07s - 3796.07s |  Yeah, when technology like CrowdStrike
3797.07s - 3798.07s |  happens, it's definitely
3799.07s - 3800.07s |  a huge stressor.
3801.07s - 3802.07s |  My team, for example,
3803.07s - 3804.07s |  worked around the clock to get things done.
3805.07s - 3806.07s |  And yeah,
3807.07s - 3809.07s |  other than having additional staff members
3810.07s - 3811.07s |  or bringing third-party help,
3812.07s - 3813.07s |  yeah, I'm not sure how management
3814.07s - 3815.07s |  can deal with that
3816.07s - 3817.07s |  in a more effective way.
3818.07s - 3819.07s |  Right.
3820.07s - 3821.07s |  And my concerns are also not just
3822.07s - 3823.07s |  for my IT tech team
3824.07s - 3825.07s |  that's dealing with it head-on,
3825.07s - 3826.07s |  but employees in other sectors
3827.07s - 3828.07s |  that are being affected.
3829.07s - 3830.07s |  They're not being able to do their job.
3831.07s - 3832.07s |  They may not be directly responsible
3833.07s - 3834.07s |  or directly be able to even assist.
3835.07s - 3836.07s |  But, you know, we need something
3837.07s - 3838.07s |  to help combat their level of stress
3839.07s - 3840.07s |  because they're unable
3841.07s - 3842.07s |  to utilize the tools that they needed.
3843.07s - 3844.07s |  You know what I mean?
3845.07s - 3846.07s |  Yeah, yeah.
3847.07s - 3848.07s |  It's a tough question.
3849.07s - 3850.07s |  I don't know.
3851.07s - 3853.07s |  I don't quite have the full answer for you.
3853.07s - 3854.07s |  And like I said,
3855.07s - 3856.07s |  this could be things
3857.07s - 3858.07s |  that we continue our discussion on
3859.07s - 3865.92s |  and try to find the answer for.
3866.92s - 3867.92s |  Well, I appreciate your bringing awareness
3868.92s - 3869.92s |  to the subject,
3869.92s - 3870.92s |  and hopefully we will be able to,
3871.92s - 3872.92s |  you know, move forward
3873.92s - 3876.46s |  with progress in that area.
3877.46s - 3878.46s |  I'm hoping that maybe in a year or two
3879.46s - 3880.46s |  you can do a follow-up talk
3881.46s - 3882.46s |  and tell us about all the improvements
3883.46s - 3884.46s |  that have been made in the industry
3885.46s - 3886.46s |  or positive one.
3887.46s - 3888.46s |  Thank you.
3888.46s - 3889.46s |  Thank you for the follow-up.
3890.46s - 3891.46s |  Thank you.
