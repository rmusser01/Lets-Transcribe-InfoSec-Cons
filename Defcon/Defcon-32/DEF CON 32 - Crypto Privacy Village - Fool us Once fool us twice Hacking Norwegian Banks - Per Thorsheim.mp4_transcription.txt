 Yeah, so just for the audience, we will do our talk,
3.76s - 6.64s |  and then we have some time afterwards
6.64s - 9.24s |  to answer any questions.
9.24s - 12.32s |  We are really interested in feedback from people from,
12.32s - 14.44s |  well, not from Norway, where we are from,
14.44s - 17.56s |  but from US and any other country in the world.
17.56s - 19.28s |  And we will also be around here
19.28s - 22.28s |  both on tomorrow and on Sunday.
22.28s - 24.44s |  But it's time to get started.
24.44s - 27.08s |  Hello, my name is Per, I'm from Norway,
27.12s - 29.20s |  and I have with me Cecilia.
30.12s - 33.96s |  And we are going to talk about Fool Me Once, Fool Me Twice,
33.96s - 36.88s |  Hacking Norwegian Banks Using Paper ID.
38.52s - 41.04s |  So Cecilia, about yourself.
41.04s - 44.20s |  Yes, whenever people ask me,
44.20s - 45.44s |  how did you get into security?
45.44s - 49.56s |  I have to tell them, my background is psychology.
49.56s - 51.84s |  I don't know anything about programming.
51.84s - 55.80s |  I have a master's in philosophy of technology.
57.12s - 59.80s |  And I have a background as a software tester.
59.80s - 61.76s |  I've been doing that for years.
61.76s - 64.60s |  And after testing a lot of software,
64.60s - 66.64s |  that's how I got into security.
66.64s - 68.52s |  More specifically, abusability.
70.08s - 73.68s |  I, by the way, I love, I adore humans.
73.68s - 75.32s |  I may elude a few individuals,
75.32s - 77.68s |  but I love humans in general.
77.68s - 78.52s |  Yeah.
79.76s - 84.44s |  So when I do software testing,
84.44s - 86.24s |  I keep asking myself,
86.24s - 89.84s |  how can I mess up someone's life with this software?
89.84s - 93.00s |  And of course I'm asking this because I'm a nice person,
93.00s - 94.36s |  because I want to fix it.
94.36s - 99.62s |  I'm not trying to mess up your lives.
99.62s - 102.94s |  Yeah, and on September 1st, it's to the day,
102.94s - 105.42s |  30 years since I started in information security.
105.42s - 107.46s |  So that's the stuff I know.
107.46s - 111.86s |  I have a very healthy obsession into passwords.
111.86s - 113.22s |  I'm also divorced.
113.22s - 115.38s |  There's no connection there, of course.
115.38s - 119.50s |  And been working in my two previous positions as a CISO
119.50s - 123.30s |  for what we in Norway would say big corporations
123.30s - 127.46s |  that would be very small sized companies here in the US.
127.46s - 131.26s |  And yeah, I have done all kinds of stuff
131.26s - 133.54s |  within information security.
133.54s - 135.62s |  But today it's a little bit more, you know,
135.62s - 140.30s |  the basics of our talks has to do a little bit with hacking.
140.30s - 145.06s |  The term abusability, I, you know, show of hands,
145.06s - 146.74s |  do you know the term abusability
146.74s - 148.62s |  and what we mean by that?
148.62s - 149.46s |  Some do, okay.
149.46s - 151.86s |  Very quickly, abusability again,
151.86s - 153.66s |  I'm gonna use a piece of software
153.66s - 156.30s |  to make your life really, really bad.
156.30s - 159.14s |  As a stalker, your ex, your spouse for that matter,
159.14s - 160.46s |  and so on.
160.46s - 162.34s |  And then we also have responsible disclosure,
162.34s - 165.50s |  which you should also be known to you.
165.50s - 169.06s |  The work that we two do together, you know,
169.06s - 171.14s |  we are, it is very important for us
171.14s - 172.62s |  to follow responsible disclosure.
172.62s - 175.30s |  We don't want to mess up things for real.
175.30s - 177.94s |  We find problems and we try to fix them.
177.94s - 179.82s |  We don't want to give any recipe
179.82s - 182.90s |  for the bad actors out there to do bad things.
184.30s - 186.98s |  And Norway, where we live,
186.98s - 188.82s |  we are four and a half, 5 million people.
188.82s - 192.78s |  So it's a small country in population.
192.78s - 195.06s |  And we are very indigital.
195.06s - 197.90s |  I actually found out just a short while ago,
198.86s - 201.06s |  I suddenly had to sign a piece of paper
201.10s - 204.82s |  and I discovered that I don't have a pen at home.
204.82s - 206.34s |  And I tried to remember,
206.34s - 209.10s |  and it's probably like four or five years
209.10s - 212.06s |  since the last time I actually used a pen.
212.06s - 214.38s |  Whenever I do interact with the government
214.38s - 218.18s |  for healthcare, for insurance, banks, whatever,
218.18s - 219.78s |  I do it online.
219.78s - 225.06s |  And the last time I used cash back at home in Norway,
225.06s - 227.02s |  I'm not sure really,
228.62s - 230.62s |  four, five, six, seven years ago,
230.62s - 232.26s |  maybe something like that.
232.86s - 234.18s |  We use card and we have Apple Pay,
234.18s - 236.26s |  Google Pay and all that stuff.
236.26s - 237.58s |  We don't do, yes, yes,
237.58s - 240.54s |  we don't do our elections online.
243.34s - 244.94s |  And if it is up to me,
244.94s - 248.18s |  we're going to continue doing that on paper.
248.18s - 251.74s |  But okay, so we can do credit checks.
251.74s - 253.02s |  We have a debt register,
253.02s - 255.98s |  so you can go online and find out how much money you owe.
255.98s - 258.34s |  And also if you want to get a mortgage for a house
258.34s - 260.06s |  or a car, anything like that,
260.06s - 262.38s |  the bank can check how much money do you owe
262.38s - 265.14s |  to which companies, as an example.
265.14s - 266.86s |  So it's sort of like, I will say,
266.86s - 269.34s |  a very transparent society that we have,
269.34s - 270.70s |  and we trust our government,
270.70s - 272.22s |  we trust each other,
272.22s - 273.94s |  which can be a problem sometimes,
273.94s - 276.74s |  but again, we are really happy about the democracy
276.74s - 278.46s |  that we have in Norway.
279.66s - 281.98s |  And of course, we're a little bit curious about,
281.98s - 284.50s |  you know, how this works in the US,
284.50s - 285.90s |  being here right now.
286.46s - 291.38s |  And this talk is a little bit about power of attorney,
291.38s - 294.86s |  giving somebody else access to your bank account.
297.14s - 299.66s |  In Norway, it's easy to do.
300.70s - 301.82s |  You can do it online.
301.82s - 303.22s |  I can log on to my bank,
303.22s - 305.74s |  and I can say that I want my friend Cecilia
305.74s - 307.02s |  to have access to my bank account
307.02s - 309.50s |  because I'm sick, I'm disabled,
309.50s - 311.30s |  I'm going to the hospital for surgery,
311.30s - 312.98s |  I will be away for some time,
313.02s - 316.22s |  and I will allow her to handle my financial stuff.
318.10s - 322.34s |  This can be useful in romantic partnerships,
322.34s - 324.38s |  this for kids.
327.14s - 328.46s |  And of course, as I said,
328.46s - 331.38s |  if you have disabilities and stuff like that,
331.38s - 333.82s |  this can be really useful.
333.82s - 337.42s |  At least that's what we saw from the advertisements
337.42s - 340.18s |  from the banks that came about many years ago.
340.18s - 342.94s |  They said, do not give away your digital identity
342.94s - 344.02s |  to somebody else.
344.02s - 345.78s |  Give them a power of attorney access
345.78s - 346.94s |  to your account instead.
346.94s - 349.46s |  That's the proper way of doing it.
349.46s - 352.82s |  Because we have a digital ID in Norway called bank ID.
352.82s - 354.02s |  I used to be a CISO there,
354.02s - 356.94s |  so I know a lot about it.
356.94s - 360.34s |  And that's your digital ID that is legally you.
360.34s - 365.48s |  So never give that away to anyone.
365.48s - 366.32s |  Now,
369.24s - 370.76s |  this gets interesting
370.76s - 374.44s |  because if I give Cecilia access to my bank account,
374.44s - 377.24s |  we saw this and I have no special needs.
377.24s - 379.20s |  I don't need anyone to handle my finances
379.20s - 380.44s |  in the same way around.
381.64s - 382.48s |  But the bank said,
382.48s - 386.16s |  we have a paper form to do this as well
386.16s - 388.96s |  because in some cases you don't have bank ID.
388.96s - 391.56s |  As an example, Norway is now receiving
391.56s - 394.04s |  quite a lot of Ukrainian refugees.
394.04s - 395.96s |  I'm happy that we do that.
395.96s - 398.56s |  But since we don't have a credit history for them,
398.56s - 400.40s |  we don't know anything about them,
400.40s - 402.28s |  they will have to wait for quite some time
402.28s - 406.68s |  before they get into the digital society of Norway.
406.68s - 408.68s |  Then you have disabled people,
408.68s - 410.64s |  people that have a legal guardian, as an example,
410.64s - 412.84s |  they will not receive a bank ID
412.84s - 415.36s |  because you can do quite a few stupid things
415.36s - 417.68s |  with a legal ID online as well.
418.56s - 420.88s |  So I thought that,
420.88s - 424.48s |  well, Cecilia, we got to test this stuff.
424.48s - 427.88s |  Would you like access to my bank account?
427.88s - 431.76s |  And she said, yeah, sure.
432.24s - 433.08s |  Let's try it out.
433.08s - 434.92s |  Let's see what happens.
434.92s - 436.04s |  And by the way,
436.04s - 439.44s |  I tend to sometimes be a bit stupid on these things.
439.44s - 440.84s |  So I like to challenge people
440.84s - 443.00s |  and usually I'm proven wrong and I regret it.
443.00s - 445.00s |  But here's the thing.
445.00s - 447.24s |  So the challenge was sort of,
447.24s - 450.68s |  for Cecilia, instead of giving her legal access,
450.68s - 452.44s |  it was like a game of,
452.44s - 455.92s |  you will try to obtain a legal access to my account,
455.92s - 457.32s |  but we are cooperating on this.
457.32s - 458.96s |  So we don't break the law,
458.96s - 461.20s |  we don't break the rules of the bank,
461.20s - 464.24s |  but you will need to get access to my bank accounts
464.24s - 467.88s |  using a paper form, plain old paper,
467.88s - 472.65s |  and let's see if that is going to work.
472.65s - 473.49s |  Yes.
478.13s - 481.65s |  Banks have a lot of security, a lot of security.
481.65s - 485.13s |  If you're going to do any kind of pen testing or hacking
485.13s - 488.09s |  or bounty hunting, don't bother with the banks.
489.73s - 492.25s |  There's so many measures in place.
492.25s - 494.85s |  However, it's important to remember that
494.89s - 496.97s |  those measures that they have in place,
496.97s - 500.25s |  they're not your security measures.
500.25s - 502.21s |  They are their security measure.
502.21s - 504.49s |  And most of the time there's an overlap.
504.49s - 505.65s |  You don't want to get robbed
505.65s - 508.65s |  and they don't want to be the bank that gets robbed.
508.65s - 513.65s |  However, once in a while, these things tend to split.
515.79s - 517.23s |  This is the paper form.
517.23s - 518.83s |  The challenge is, of course,
518.83s - 523.19s |  I have to figure out his name, his address,
523.19s - 526.99s |  his social security number, his bank account number.
526.99s - 531.51s |  I also need some witnesses and I need to sign it,
531.51s - 533.59s |  both as him and me.
534.79s - 536.43s |  And this is very interesting because,
536.43s - 539.31s |  well, name and address, look up the phone book.
539.31s - 540.55s |  It's not difficult.
540.55s - 543.55s |  Social security numbers are not secrets.
545.51s - 547.51s |  They are absolutely not secrets.
547.51s - 550.67s |  They are treated like secrets, but they are not secrets.
550.67s - 553.27s |  It's an identification number.
553.27s - 555.23s |  So it's a predictable number.
556.23s - 558.23s |  Roughly speaking, it doesn't take a lot of guessing.
558.23s - 562.23s |  And also there was some services that were very helpful
562.23s - 563.67s |  letting me verify it.
564.91s - 566.83s |  They didn't know that.
566.83s - 568.35s |  The most difficult part here
568.35s - 570.99s |  is actually the bank account number.
570.99s - 575.99s |  Now, bank account numbers are by design, not a secret.
578.91s - 579.99s |  They're not secret.
580.99s - 584.79s |  However, I didn't happen to have his bank account number,
584.79s - 586.03s |  so I need a little bit help,
586.03s - 588.35s |  but we found a way around it.
589.91s - 592.63s |  Some back and forth and we got hold,
592.63s - 596.11s |  and I got a hold of his bank account number.
596.11s - 597.87s |  Witnesses, beautiful.
597.87s - 600.23s |  I love all the helpful people around.
600.23s - 602.23s |  They're not always sure what they're signing,
602.23s - 603.71s |  but they are very helpful.
603.71s - 605.95s |  Thank you for your service.
605.95s - 606.95s |  Signature.
607.95s - 610.91s |  Signature is very, very, very interesting
610.91s - 615.91s |  because when did you last sign your name
616.15s - 617.95s |  on a piece of paper?
617.95s - 621.99s |  This week, last week, a month?
621.99s - 624.07s |  I don't sign my name on anything,
624.07s - 625.71s |  and I don't sign my name on anything
625.71s - 627.39s |  and give it to the bank.
627.39s - 629.95s |  So if they're gonna compare my signature
629.95s - 631.79s |  and probably his as well,
631.79s - 635.51s |  it's gonna be to a very, very, very old signature.
637.27s - 643.74s |  So that was the part that I was nervous about.
644.10s - 648.22s |  So yeah, you're 100% not surprised,
648.22s - 651.02s |  but yes, I did get access.
653.26s - 654.86s |  I didn't know what was gonna happen
654.86s - 657.10s |  when we started this project,
657.10s - 660.82s |  but we discovered there were absolutely no controls.
660.82s - 665.46s |  And most surprisingly, he didn't get notify.
665.46s - 667.42s |  I didn't get notify.
667.42s - 671.22s |  I just happened to discover I have access now.
671.22s - 674.58s |  One evening that I was logging on to see how is it going?
674.58s - 676.30s |  Did I get access soon?
676.30s - 678.22s |  Yes, I have full access.
680.46s - 681.30s |  Full access.
681.30s - 682.70s |  I have full access.
682.70s - 686.10s |  I have 10 years of your history, banking history.
687.78s - 689.18s |  I didn't really think about that.
689.18s - 692.70s |  She could actually see 10 years of transactions
692.70s - 693.78s |  on my credit card.
693.78s - 694.74s |  That was like,
695.22s - 697.30s |  um, shit.
699.02s - 700.74s |  I know you really well.
700.74s - 702.26s |  I did get-
702.26s - 704.38s |  I had already been several times to Vegas.
708.42s - 710.06s |  Yes, you are my retirement plan.
712.30s - 715.34s |  Anyways, yes, I did get all your money as well.
717.02s - 720.58s |  What I didn't, what I couldn't do was pay his bills.
720.98s - 723.54s |  Which, what?
723.54s - 726.94s |  If I was gonna do this for legal and good reasons
726.94s - 730.34s |  to help you out and not just mess around with you,
731.38s - 734.62s |  paying the bills is the most important part of this.
735.54s - 737.02s |  Anyways.
737.02s - 740.18s |  She could do all the bad things.
740.18s - 743.14s |  And the one thing that I really want her to help me with
743.14s - 746.30s |  because I'm sick or disabled is to pay my bills.
746.30s - 749.98s |  And that's the one thing she couldn't do.
749.98s - 752.46s |  And she can't do that today either.
752.46s - 753.30s |  Nope.
753.30s - 754.42s |  So we have been sort of saying like,
754.42s - 758.54s |  this system is, uh, it doesn't actually work.
758.54s - 760.10s |  No, it does not work.
761.82s - 764.10s |  Anyways, we're very nice people.
764.10s - 766.30s |  You can trust us, really.
766.30s - 770.10s |  So of course we did the right thing.
770.10s - 772.10s |  Number one, we did tell the banks.
773.82s - 777.74s |  We also let them fix the issue before we told anyone else.
777.78s - 780.10s |  Now, this was an unpaged project,
780.10s - 783.18s |  so we can't tell anyone else.
783.18s - 788.18s |  And then we dutifully warned the public.
788.58s - 790.66s |  Let me emphasize that.
790.66s - 794.62s |  We warned the public by going into the newspapers,
794.62s - 797.30s |  telling about this, so that other banks,
797.30s - 799.22s |  because there are more than, you know, a few,
799.22s - 800.38s |  there's a lot of them,
800.38s - 803.54s |  and I cannot spend all my evenings and weekends
803.54s - 805.82s |  fixing their stuff and giving them
805.82s - 809.54s |  one-on-one consultations, unpaid.
809.54s - 812.14s |  So, you know, they have to learn
812.14s - 815.66s |  from what's out in the media and so on.
817.06s - 821.10s |  So we did this, exhaled, waited a little bit.
823.26s - 824.42s |  Do you want to go on?
824.42s - 827.12s |  Yeah.
827.12s - 830.60s |  You know, you find a vulnerability and go public about it
830.60s - 833.96s |  as soon as it's been fixed in one bank.
833.96s - 835.40s |  And the reason for going public
835.40s - 836.72s |  is to warn all the other banks
836.72s - 838.08s |  that we found this vulnerability
838.08s - 839.48s |  and you should check your systems,
839.48s - 844.48s |  your procedures for checking paper forms
844.64s - 847.96s |  and the hand signature on that, on them.
847.96s - 852.96s |  And we thought they actually read the articles and did that.
854.24s - 856.04s |  So we waited a couple of years,
856.04s - 860.96s |  and then it was like, do you think they'll fix it now?
861.96s - 864.40s |  And then we went at it at a new bank.
864.40s - 866.72s |  And yeah, you know the answer.
867.64s - 870.24s |  We did it again, exact same way.
870.24s - 873.68s |  But we also found some interesting differences
873.68s - 876.28s |  between the first bank and the second bank.
876.28s - 878.76s |  And that was also with approximately four years
878.76s - 880.48s |  between those two hacks.
881.64s - 886.64s |  And in the new hack, the second bank that we did this,
887.64s - 890.40s |  suddenly we saw that, well, me as the account owner,
890.40s - 892.96s |  I could actually see that her name
892.96s - 896.12s |  was on the transactions that she had done
896.12s - 898.20s |  on sort of like my behalf.
898.20s - 899.48s |  She couldn't pay my bills,
899.48s - 902.24s |  but she could move all my money to a foreign account
902.24s - 904.64s |  in Aruba or someplace like that.
904.64s - 905.48s |  Go figure.
906.76s - 910.68s |  You know, perfect power attorney access.
910.68s - 911.72s |  And it's also important to say,
911.72s - 913.60s |  this is, you know, it's all or nothing.
913.60s - 915.00s |  There's no, you know,
915.00s - 916.12s |  it's all or nothing.
916.12s - 920.32s |  There's no granular access here, all or nothing access.
920.32s - 924.48s |  So that was a good thing compared to the previous test.
924.48s - 926.52s |  Now I could see that the transactions
926.52s - 930.32s |  had been carried out by Cecilia or myself.
930.32s - 934.88s |  First bank, all transactions showed up as I did it.
934.88s - 937.56s |  We even called the bank and I said, I didn't do this.
937.56s - 939.12s |  And they said, yes, you did.
940.20s - 942.92s |  And I say, well, I have sort of a legal guardian
942.92s - 944.68s |  or power of attorney given to another friend.
945.36s - 946.80s |  And they said, well, it's, you know,
946.80s - 949.72s |  if you trust that person, that's your problem, not ours.
949.72s - 951.28s |  So there we go.
951.28s - 953.96s |  So it was good to see that in the second bank,
953.96s - 957.12s |  I could actually see she had been doing the transactions.
957.12s - 959.64s |  But there was also some bad things here.
961.92s - 962.80s |  Cecilia.
962.80s - 964.24s |  Yeah.
964.24s - 967.64s |  So there was only one bank that had started
967.64s - 970.80s |  improving the interfaces to help people like Per
970.80s - 974.16s |  that may get taken advantage of
974.36s - 977.12s |  and robbed by loved ones.
977.12s - 979.96s |  And this is the conclusion from the investigation
979.96s - 982.36s |  and the project is that protecting yourself
982.36s - 987.36s |  from this kind of fraud or scam is pretty much impossible
987.80s - 991.48s |  because a lot of the time you, well, you don't get notified
991.48s - 993.68s |  and it's hard to see that someone else
993.68s - 995.68s |  have access to your account.
995.68s - 998.12s |  And when you don't see in transaction list
998.12s - 1001.28s |  the different names, it's even more,
1001.28s - 1003.00s |  you end up gaslighting yourself.
1003.00s - 1005.32s |  What did, did I buy that online?
1005.32s - 1006.80s |  I didn't know that.
1006.80s - 1008.88s |  You know, you start questioning yourself.
1008.88s - 1012.72s |  Should I get my brain tested?
1012.72s - 1014.60s |  Is this early dementia?
1014.60s - 1019.00s |  You know, so super hard to see if someone have access
1019.00s - 1020.44s |  and that is not a good thing.
1021.32s - 1025.96s |  Now, of course, I don't know, like, is there anyone here?
1025.96s - 1027.12s |  No, you don't have to put your hand up,
1027.12s - 1031.32s |  but I hope some of you either working at bank
1031.32s - 1035.60s |  or at least have a bank and feel like complaining to them
1035.60s - 1038.80s |  because what's really important
1038.80s - 1041.64s |  is to be notified ahead of time,
1041.64s - 1045.92s |  not just like five minutes, but a week at least
1045.92s - 1050.44s |  so that the sick and disabled pet have time to worry
1050.44s - 1052.84s |  and figure out and get out of his sick bed
1052.84s - 1056.20s |  and call the bank and say, hey, I got this notification.
1056.20s - 1057.36s |  I don't know what's going on.
1057.36s - 1061.08s |  Could you tell me so they can stop it before I rob him?
1063.28s - 1066.60s |  It should absolutely be visible for the account holder
1066.60s - 1070.44s |  to see who's done transactions on his account.
1070.44s - 1075.20s |  And if I can really, really ask, be difficult and ask,
1075.20s - 1077.52s |  can we get transaction limits
1077.52s - 1080.28s |  and co-signing for bigger amounts?
1080.28s - 1084.32s |  It is insane that I can, there's an all or nothing.
1085.28s - 1087.12s |  Now, what can you do?
1087.88s - 1090.68s |  Except from complaining to your bank, because you should.
1092.20s - 1094.00s |  If you need a power of attorney
1094.00s - 1096.20s |  or gonna have a what's called a joint account
1096.20s - 1101.00s |  that we have here in US, make sure it's a new account.
1101.00s - 1105.96s |  Like, sweetie, whoever you're sharing your account with,
1105.96s - 1108.48s |  they don't need to know the last 10 years
1108.48s - 1109.60s |  what you've been up to.
1111.00s - 1113.40s |  Also, you need to spread your money out
1113.40s - 1115.92s |  on several accounts or banks.
1115.92s - 1117.84s |  Remember that banking in the US
1117.84s - 1119.84s |  is very much a locking situation
1119.84s - 1124.20s |  because of your credit system, but try spread it out.
1124.20s - 1126.64s |  So in case it turns out,
1126.64s - 1129.92s |  whoever you're trusting is not as trustworthy,
1129.92s - 1132.56s |  you're not losing all of your money.
1133.84s - 1135.36s |  That's it, really.
1135.36s - 1138.64s |  That's the only advice I can give you.
1138.64s - 1145.82s |  Now, do you have any questions?
1145.82s - 1147.82s |  Yes, I have a question.
1149.58s - 1150.42s |  Yes.
1151.90s - 1152.74s |  Say again.
1155.02s - 1157.22s |  No, but I can tell what I did with the money.
1158.82s - 1161.14s |  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's okay.
1161.14s - 1164.02s |  Tell them what you did with my money, my money.
1164.02s - 1165.46s |  I'm a very nice person.
1165.46s - 1168.90s |  So in addition to transfer a very small amount to myself,
1168.90s - 1172.22s |  I, of course, donated to cancer, breast cancer,
1172.22s - 1173.54s |  I think, specifically.
1173.54s - 1175.66s |  Breast cancer research, yes.
1176.50s - 1179.34s |  However, you may not be familiar with European law,
1179.34s - 1182.82s |  but if you donate money or contact any organization,
1182.82s - 1184.30s |  they are allowed to contact you.
1184.30s - 1185.14s |  Right, Ted?
1186.02s - 1190.34s |  So earlier this year, I was visiting Gdansk in Poland.
1190.34s - 1191.70s |  I went for the first time in my life
1191.70s - 1196.42s |  to one of the concentration camps to remember history.
1196.42s - 1198.54s |  And walking in the streets in Gdansk,
1198.54s - 1202.10s |  relaxing for a few days, my phone calls,
1202.10s - 1204.82s |  I answer because I usually do that.
1205.66s - 1208.14s |  And it's the Norwegian Cancer Society
1208.14s - 1209.94s |  or something like that in Norway calling me like,
1209.94s - 1212.90s |  oh, thank you so much for your gift to us.
1212.90s - 1214.86s |  And we would really like to ask you
1214.86s - 1218.02s |  if you're interested in supporting us anymore.
1219.02s - 1224.42s |  And I was like, dementia?
1224.42s - 1227.50s |  I'm just 52, like,
1227.50s - 1230.98s |  did I ever donate to the Norwegian Cancer Association?
1232.38s - 1233.22s |  Ah.
1235.14s - 1237.74s |  You know, I gotta come back to you again,
1237.78s - 1239.62s |  but it's a really good cause.
1239.62s - 1242.94s |  And yeah, I would probably donate more money later on.
1242.94s - 1244.98s |  And then it came to me like,
1244.98s - 1247.90s |  somebody had access to my bank accounts.
1247.90s - 1250.26s |  So, well, a really good cause,
1250.26s - 1252.46s |  fully supported, gonna donate again.
1252.46s - 1255.90s |  But that was, yeah, that was a little bit of surprise.
1255.90s - 1257.94s |  We can also go back to the paper form
1257.94s - 1260.54s |  just to make sure that you really understand
1260.54s - 1262.46s |  the lack of controls.
1262.46s - 1265.46s |  We used several colored pens.
1267.98s - 1269.58s |  To sign the form,
1269.58s - 1272.34s |  we had several people write our names,
1272.34s - 1274.26s |  first and last name and so on.
1274.26s - 1276.02s |  So if you look at the fill out paper form,
1276.02s - 1277.26s |  it's like crazy.
1277.26s - 1279.74s |  It's, it doesn't make sense at all.
1279.74s - 1281.02s |  And of course the signatures
1281.02s - 1282.42s |  were completely wrong as well.
1282.42s - 1285.02s |  So if they did a signature verification
1285.02s - 1287.86s |  against my 30 year old signature on file
1287.86s - 1289.54s |  that they have in my bank,
1289.54s - 1292.10s |  it's like, it doesn't look anything
1292.10s - 1293.90s |  like my original signature at all.
1293.90s - 1295.62s |  So they didn't verify anything.
1295.62s - 1297.26s |  It just went through.
1297.26s - 1300.58s |  That was crazy to us.
1300.58s - 1303.90s |  So going forward into a more digital world,
1303.90s - 1306.70s |  be it in the US or in Iceland or Japan
1306.70s - 1308.42s |  or wherever you are,
1308.42s - 1310.74s |  remember that going digital,
1310.74s - 1312.54s |  there will still be a lot of people
1312.54s - 1314.86s |  that need to use paper forms.
1314.86s - 1316.66s |  And the security of those paper forms
1316.66s - 1319.54s |  has to be equal to the digital security
1319.54s - 1320.38s |  that you're implementing.
1320.38s - 1321.98s |  And that's sort of the, you know,
1321.98s - 1324.94s |  important end of our talk here.
1324.94s - 1326.18s |  And we'll be around for a little bit.
1326.18s - 1327.82s |  So questions, feel free.
1327.82s - 1329.14s |  Thank you so much again.
