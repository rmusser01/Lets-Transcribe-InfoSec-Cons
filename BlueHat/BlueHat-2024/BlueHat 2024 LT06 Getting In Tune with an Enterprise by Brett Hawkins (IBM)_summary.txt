**Event Overview**
- **Title**: BlueHat 2024: LT06: Getting "In Tune" with an Enterprise by Brett Hawkins (IBM)
- **Platform**: Microsoft Intune
- **Focus**: Detecting Microsoft Intune Lateral Movement

**Introduction**
- **Presenter**: Brett Hawkins, IBM X-Force Red
- **Research Objective**: Explore Microsoft Intune for lateral movement and code execution

**Background**
- **Hybrid Identity Environments**: Integration of on-premises Active Directory with Microsoft Entra ID
- **Microsoft Intune**: Popular device management solution in hybrid environments
- **Target for Attackers**: Intune's integration with on-premises services makes it a prime attack vector

**Research Highlights**
- **Code Execution**: Deploy custom Windows applications via Intune
- **Detection Rules**: Public release of Microsoft Sentinel rules for detecting Intune abuse
- **Defensive Hardening**: Guidance for securing the Intune platform

**Offensive Use Cases**
- **Compromising Intune Administrator**: Use privileges to deploy malicious applications
- **Payload Deployment**: Transfer and execute payloads on target hosts using Intune
- **Script Execution**: Deploy PowerShell scripts, MSI files, and Win32 apps

**Defensive Measures**
- **Intune Audit Logs**: Capture auditable events for monitoring
- **Microsoft Sentinel**: Stream logs for detection and threat hunting
- **Multi-Admin Approval**: Require approvals for deploying apps or scripts

**Best Practices**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for Azure Portal and Intune Admin Center
- **Review Privileged Access**: Regular audits of cloud-only accounts for privileged roles
- **Secure Device Management**: Critical as organizations adopt hybrid identity architectures

**Conclusion**
- **Offensive Insights**: Device management systems offer stealthy lateral movement opportunities
- **Defensive Importance**: Securing device management systems and administrators is crucial
- **Research Contribution**: Development of detection rules for potential misuse scenarios
