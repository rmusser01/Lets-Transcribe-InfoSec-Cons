**Event Overview**
- Title: BlueHat 2024: S01: The two sides of UnOAuthorized
- Presenters: Eric Woodruff (Semperis), Cameron Vincent (Microsoft)
- Focus: Privilege elevation to **Global Administrator** in **Entra ID**

**Research Background**
- **Global Administrator (GA)**: Critical role for **Microsoft 365** and **Azure**
- **Role-based access control** and **application consent model**: Intended to limit GA access
- Exploration of **application permissions** in **Entra ID**

**Research Findings**
- **Service Principles**: Often misunderstood by enterprises; can be exploited by attackers
- **Previous Research**: Dirk Janâ€™s 2019 article on Microsoft application permissions
- **Application Administrator Role**: Prerequisite for identified vulnerability

**Technical Exploration**
- **Multi-tenant Applications**: Security implications of app registration and permissions
- **OAuth 2 Client Credential Grant Flow**: Methodology for accessing **Graph API**
- **Graph API**: Central to the research; used for impersonating Microsoft applications

**Privilege Tests Conducted**
- Actions tested: Disabling users, changing passwords, managing roles, creating/deleting users
- **Findings**: Ability to manage roles and users without appropriate permissions

**Response and Remediation**
- **MSRC Process**: Case analysis begins immediately, prioritization based on clarity and impact
- **Case Management**: Multiple cases opened for different services (Viva Engage, Device Registration)
- **Authorization Systems**: Importance of understanding underlying models beyond **OAuth scopes**

**Security Recommendations**
- **Workload Identities**: Emphasis on securing non-human identities in the cloud
- **App Role Management**: Risks associated with role management permissions
- **Workload Identity Premium**: Conditional access for highly privileged applications

**Key Takeaways**
- Importance of **role-based access control** and **security research**
- Need for comprehensive **security measures** for application permissions
- **MSRC's** role in addressing and mitigating security vulnerabilities
