**Firmware Security: Importance and Challenges**
- **Firmware** is often de-prioritized in security.
- **Assumption**: Firmware vulnerabilities are hard to exploit and require sophisticated actors.
- **Goal**: Break this assumption and prioritize patching firmware vulnerabilities.

**Understanding Firmware**
- **Firmware**: Low-level software controlling hardware components.
- **BIOS**: Type of firmware on motherboards.
- **UEFI**: Specification for secure firmware implementation.

**Importance of Firmware Security**
- **First code** to run when a machine starts, setting up the environment for the operating system.
- **Supply chain complexity**: Many players make patching difficult.

**Establishing Trust in Firmware**
- **Chain of Trust**: Verifies and measures each piece of code.
- **DB and DBX**: Lists of allowed and revoked hashes/signatures.
- **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**: Stores cryptographic hashes.

**Boot Process and Secure Boot**
- **Secure Boot**: Verifies and measures each component during boot.
- **Measured Boot**: Continues the chain of trust.
- **Microsoft Program**: Verifies and signs firmware for consistency.

**Supply Chain Complexity**
- **Original Device Manufacturers (ODMs)**: Produce PCBs and components.
- **OEMs**: Sell machines with components.
- **Silicon Providers**: Develop CPUs.
- **Independent BIOS Vendors (IBVs)**: Develop firmware.

**Patching Challenges**
- **Dependency Chain**: Vulnerabilities higher up cause more impact and are harder to patch.
- **Examples**: 
  - **Boothole** in Grub2: Took a year to update revocation lists.
  - **Logo Fail**: Vulnerability in BIOS vendors.
  - **Black Lotus**: Exploited Windows Bootloader vulnerability.

**Solutions and Future Directions**
- **Community Effort**: Eliminate bottlenecks in DB and DBX updates.
- **Secure Boot Advanced Targeting**: Use version numbers for firmware validity.
- **Hold OEMs accountable**: Ensure they patch vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion**
- Prioritize firmware patching to avoid prolonged vulnerabilities.
- **Motivation**: Address firmware vulnerabilities promptly.
