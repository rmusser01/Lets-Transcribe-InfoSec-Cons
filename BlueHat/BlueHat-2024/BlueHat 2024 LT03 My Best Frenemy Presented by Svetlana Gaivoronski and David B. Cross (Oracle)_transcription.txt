  "description": "BlueHat 2024: LT03: My Best Frenemy Presented by Svetlana Gaivoronski and David B. Cross (Oracle)\n\nAbstract: At Oracle, we maintain a robust security posture through the dynamic synergy of our Red Team and Blue Team, functioning as best frenemies. While the Red Team simulates attackers by seeking out vulnerabilities and testing our defenses, the Blue Team serves as vigilant defenders, monitoring systems, detecting threats, and responding to incidents. However, the true challenge lies in managing the human aspects of this relationship.\n\nThe success of a Red Team exercise can often feel like a failure for the Blue Team, leading to potential friction and demoralization. To navigate these human challenges, we have fostered a culture of communication and empathy. After each exercise, both teams come together for debriefs, where they share insights and discuss what worked and what didn't. This approach ensures that every Red Team success is viewed as an opportunity for Blue Team improvement, fostering a sense of shared accomplishment.\nWhen the Blue Team detects Red Team activities, they are encouraged to monitor and analyze rather than immediately shutting them down. This strategy allows the Blue Team to learn and enhance their defensive measures while understanding the tactics used by potential adversaries. It's a controlled environment where both teams can test and improve their skills without fear of failure.\nBy maintaining a clear separation yet promoting collaboration, we create a seamless integration that strengthens our security posture. This careful balance helps manage the emotional aspects of the Red and Blue Team relationship, ensuring continuous improvement and a robust security framework.\n\nIn this talk, we'll cover all these challenges and the practical steps we're taking to overcome them, as well as share some anecdotes from day-to-day Red/Blue collaboration.",

0.00s - 8.00s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 So, we got in here and I updated the slides real quickly before it started because it's Oracle versus Microsoft, right?
8.00s - 11.00s |  We're ex-Microsofties and we're Oracle, but...
11.00s - 13.00s |  I thought that's about elections.
13.00s - 20.00s |  Uh-huh, the elections. Red versus blue. Hmm, maybe we're going to change this up a little bit here.
20.00s - 26.00s |  So, overall, the reality is we're not enemies. We're actually...
26.00s - 27.00s |  I think we're friends.
27.00s - 30.00s |  We're friends. Wow, how can that be?
30.00s - 33.00s |  Well, it's hard to imagine, right?
33.00s - 37.00s |  Yes. Red versus blue. How can you be friends?
37.00s - 46.00s |  Yeah, I think we're actually mastering our frenemy idea between David and I.
46.00s - 48.00s |  And so, first, let's introduce ourselves.
48.00s - 55.00s |  Hi, I'm David Cross. I'm a CISO and Senior Vice President at Oracle, but I'm also an ex-Microsoftie with lots of people.
55.00s - 59.00s |  Yeah, I also spent quite a number of years in Microsoft before.
59.00s - 64.00s |  Now, I'm with Oracle, leading detection engineering and some automation teams.
64.00s - 69.41s |  So, let's talk about what in the world is a frenemy.
69.41s - 77.41s |  So, frenemy is a term that actually started to be popular kind of like five years ago or so.
77.41s - 83.41s |  And it's about friends. You won't believe it, but it's about friends who care deeply about each other.
83.41s - 89.41s |  But it's a relationship of rivalry and competition and challenging each other.
89.41s - 92.41s |  So, like driving yourself to be better.
92.41s - 102.41s |  Uh-huh. So, I think it's that when you think about red team and blue team, we all kind of actually have a common enemy, don't we?
102.41s - 112.41s |  We do, indeed. And I think that's the challenge of being red versus blue, because we keep forgetting that we don't compete with each other.
112.41s - 120.41s |  We compete against common enemy that could be like North Korea, that could be Russia, I'm afraid to say.
120.41s - 123.41s |  Russia? We don't have any Chinese or Russian attackers here, do we?
123.41s - 127.41s |  I don't know. I don't really know anyone from Russia, so I won't admit it.
127.41s - 128.41s |  Let's forget about it.
128.41s - 132.41s |  Okay. Now, what's the challenge, Sveta?
132.41s - 140.41s |  So, the challenge is actually understanding that, again, we're on the same side.
140.41s - 144.41s |  It's not about wins of red team, it's not about wins of blue team.
144.41s - 152.41s |  Keeping in mind that we have one common goal, that we have one common enemy, and we're playing on the same side.
152.41s - 160.41s |  So, it's not about scoring like, you know, like I broke in, so you're a bad guy or vice versa.
160.41s - 166.41s |  And if I'm on the red team and I'm always breaking in and you never detect me, like, how can you be possibly successful?
166.41s - 168.41s |  What do you guys think?
168.41s - 172.41s |  I think it hurts feelings pretty badly.
172.41s - 177.41s |  Being a millennial, I can say it's all about hurt feelings for me all the time.
177.41s - 181.41s |  And it's not nice because, like, you know, it's coming to finger points and all the time.
181.41s - 185.41s |  It's like you're doing a bad job, you don't have enough detections.
185.41s - 191.41s |  Like, you know, how you possibly cannot find this guy breaking in.
191.41s - 193.41s |  But I think vice versa works as well, right?
193.41s - 197.41s |  When I see what you're doing, you're not happy camper.
197.41s - 199.41s |  You know, it's a great question.
199.41s - 202.41s |  I remember for like Blue Hat last year, was it John Lambert, his opening keynote?
202.41s - 205.41s |  And he says, wow, security teams should collaborate.
205.41s - 207.41s |  And I thought he was making that crap up.
207.41s - 212.41s |  But the reality is, if there's no collaboration, how can you be successful?
212.41s - 216.41s |  It's like, wow, man, I've known John for all this time.
216.41s - 219.41s |  And the first time he actually told me something true, I couldn't believe it.
219.41s - 221.41s |  Yeah, hardly believable.
221.41s - 224.72s |  I agree with you.
224.72s - 229.72s |  Now, the real challenge I can say is that management,
229.72s - 233.72s |  if they don't understand the common goals of red team and blue team,
233.72s - 237.72s |  and they see when the red team gets in and the blue team doesn't detect,
237.72s - 238.72s |  they see that as a failure.
238.72s - 241.72s |  That's actually the biggest problem of it all.
241.72s - 242.72s |  And so you have to ask yourself,
242.72s - 246.72s |  does your management actually know how red team and blue team work together?
246.72s - 247.72s |  Yeah, that's a challenge.
247.72s - 248.72s |  I agree.
248.72s - 253.72s |  And it hurts the common culture, overall culture of organization,
253.72s - 256.72s |  and it makes everything so much worse.
256.72s - 261.72s |  I think it's a challenge of us to let our management understand
261.72s - 264.72s |  what it really means, that, as we say,
264.72s - 270.72s |  apocalypse is not following this collaboration culture within our group.
270.72s - 272.72s |  Agreed.
272.72s - 276.72s |  So then, based on that, what does true success look like?
276.72s - 278.72s |  Because the red team is always getting in, right?
278.72s - 281.72s |  How does a blue team become successful?
281.72s - 284.72s |  I'd say, again, you're pointing finger to me.
284.72s - 285.72s |  What?
285.72s - 288.72s |  It's like how blue team become successful.
288.72s - 291.72s |  No, it's how we all become successful.
291.72s - 297.72s |  I would say it's iterations approach that you become a sneaker,
297.72s - 299.72s |  I'm closing my gaps.
299.72s - 301.72s |  And every time we're becoming better and better,
301.72s - 303.72s |  that's what success looks like.
303.72s - 308.72s |  It's not about, like, you know, pointing to a blue team and saying,
308.72s - 309.72s |  now you're a bit better.
309.72s - 311.72s |  We're both a bit better.
311.72s - 313.72s |  Wow, so we're supposed to work together
313.72s - 317.72s |  in saying that there's something that you want to work on,
317.72s - 319.72s |  and you may ask my help to do that?
319.72s - 321.72s |  Exactly.
321.72s - 324.72s |  Oh, wait, maybe a revelation here.
324.72s - 327.72s |  So it's then like a team culture, right?
327.72s - 330.72s |  I was kind of thinking that we know some people love football,
330.72s - 333.72s |  so I thought I'd use a football analogy here, right?
333.72s - 335.72s |  It's kind of like, I'm a Seahawks fan.
335.72s - 337.72s |  You've got the offense and the defense.
337.72s - 338.72s |  They're battering each other.
338.72s - 341.72s |  Offense and defensive team are fighting, right?
341.72s - 343.72s |  No, they're on the same team.
343.72s - 345.72s |  Yeah, when we talk about football,
345.72s - 347.72s |  nobody thinks about, you know,
347.72s - 350.72s |  oh, like offense team scored some points
350.72s - 353.72s |  so that make defense team look bad.
353.72s - 355.72s |  It's nonsense.
355.72s - 357.72s |  So I would encourage us to think
357.72s - 360.72s |  when we talk about cybersecurity organizations
360.72s - 362.72s |  and red versus blue collaboration
362.72s - 364.72s |  that we're on the same team.
364.72s - 366.72s |  Again, it's just like we're scoring differently.
366.72s - 368.72s |  And with that in mind,
368.72s - 371.72s |  like if the other team, red team, does something sneaky,
371.72s - 373.72s |  blue team should keep in mind
373.72s - 375.72s |  not what they do but why they do it.
375.72s - 378.72s |  Again, we're all becoming better.
378.72s - 379.72s |  Absolutely.
379.72s - 381.72s |  It's that, you know, the failures, right?
381.72s - 383.72s |  That's an opportunity to improve,
383.72s - 385.72s |  and we work to improve as a team.
385.72s - 388.72s |  Yeah, another thing that I would also mention on this
388.72s - 391.72s |  is, like, you know, if you're a red team member,
391.72s - 393.72s |  give, like, you know,
393.72s - 396.72s |  tap a shoulder of your blue team counterpart.
396.72s - 398.72s |  It will feel nice.
398.72s - 400.72s |  The same, like, you know, if you're in a blue team,
400.72s - 402.72s |  take red team member how great they are
402.72s - 404.72s |  and how sneaky they were
404.72s - 406.72s |  and, like, you know, how tricky it was
406.72s - 408.72s |  for you to detect them this time.
408.72s - 410.72s |  It's all about, like, you know,
410.72s - 412.72s |  having all the small wins,
412.72s - 414.72s |  and it drives the culture forward.
415.72s - 417.72s |  You know, Sveta, the other question I was wondering is that,
417.72s - 419.72s |  great, the blue team being very successful.
419.72s - 421.72s |  You spotted the red team getting in.
421.72s - 423.72s |  You should shut them down immediately, right?
423.72s - 425.72s |  Isn't that the best thing to do?
425.72s - 427.72s |  Absolutely not.
427.72s - 430.72s |  And, again, as a blue team representative,
430.72s - 434.72s |  I must admit how many times I wanted to do just that.
434.72s - 436.72s |  Because, you know, like,
436.72s - 438.72s |  otherwise it's all finger points and that, like,
438.72s - 440.72s |  I detected you on early stage,
440.72s - 442.72s |  but then I didn't do this, this, and that.
442.72s - 444.72s |  Doesn't feel good, does it?
444.72s - 447.72s |  But if we go towards real-life scenario,
447.72s - 449.72s |  like, you know, when we're developing vaccines,
449.72s - 451.72s |  we don't shut down
451.72s - 453.72s |  disease progression in lab rats
453.72s - 455.72s |  to see what's happening, right?
455.72s - 457.72s |  We want to understand how disease works
457.72s - 459.72s |  to be able to make the best
459.72s - 461.72s |  defense mechanism for this.
461.72s - 463.72s |  The same here.
463.72s - 465.72s |  You don't want to shut the red team down.
465.72s - 467.72s |  Even it will hurt your ego.
467.72s - 469.72s |  You want to observe what they do
469.72s - 471.72s |  to be better.
471.72s - 473.72s |  So if you really think about, like,
473.72s - 475.72s |  what it's like to be a spy, right?
475.72s - 477.72s |  As a spy, right, when you get one thing
477.72s - 479.72s |  that you find and take a picture of it,
479.72s - 481.72s |  do you go away?
481.72s - 483.72s |  How do you deal with that?
483.72s - 485.72s |  I think it's another thing we need to move on.
485.72s - 487.72s |  Okay.
487.72s - 489.72s |  Now, I think the reality also is that,
489.72s - 491.72s |  you know, when you shut down, right,
491.72s - 493.72s |  what happens, right?
493.72s - 495.72s |  You miss all these things, right?
495.72s - 497.72s |  The spies escape to other places, right?
497.72s - 499.72s |  And then what did you actually collect?
499.72s - 501.72s |  Yeah.
501.72s - 503.72s |  You're basically missing all the opportunities
503.72s - 505.72s |  in the world.
505.72s - 506.72s |  We don't want that.
506.72s - 508.72s |  No, we don't.
508.72s - 510.72s |  Now, the other element I think is important to call out
510.72s - 512.72s |  is, you know, with stealth, right?
512.72s - 513.72s |  We're talking about collaboration.
513.72s - 515.72s |  We're all friends, right, Sveta?
515.72s - 517.72s |  And so that means the red team has to tell the blue team
517.72s - 519.72s |  everything we're going to do, right?
519.72s - 521.72s |  Is that really good?
521.72s - 522.72s |  Well...
522.72s - 524.72s |  I would appreciate that.
524.72s - 528.00s |  But you don't do that.
528.00s - 530.00s |  Absolutely not, because the element is that
530.00s - 532.00s |  it's part of the exercise, because if you know
532.00s - 534.00s |  everything that's going to happen,
534.00s - 535.00s |  you're going to likely detect it.
535.00s - 537.00s |  You're going to be hunting for it.
537.00s - 538.00s |  And I'll give you examples.
538.00s - 540.00s |  You know, a military veteran myself is an element
540.00s - 542.00s |  is that you have standard operation procedures
542.00s - 544.00s |  that you understand.
544.00s - 545.00s |  I go back many years ago.
545.00s - 547.00s |  Was it 20, 30 years ago?
547.00s - 549.00s |  We're off the coast of Washington here.
549.00s - 551.00s |  We're doing a jamming exercise with a nuclear-powered cruiser.
551.00s - 553.00s |  Can we get through the Aegis system?
553.00s - 555.00s |  And we blew out the bleed-over,
555.00s - 557.00s |  shut down the tack end for the entire west coast
557.00s - 559.00s |  of the country, and, like, stop, right?
559.00s - 561.00s |  We stopped the exercise because we followed
561.00s - 563.00s |  the playbook, and that's so very important
563.00s - 565.00s |  in every red team and blue team exercise.
565.00s - 567.00s |  Yeah.
567.00s - 570.00s |  I would say it's extremely important
570.00s - 572.00s |  to be stealthy, again,
572.00s - 574.00s |  so we can get better.
574.00s - 576.00s |  Agreed.
576.00s - 578.00s |  Now, at the end, right, we do root cause analysis,
578.00s - 580.00s |  our postmortems, our debrief, right?
580.00s - 582.00s |  It's kind of just like we have
582.00s - 584.00s |  upcoming Thanksgiving, right?
584.00s - 586.00s |  It's just like at work.
586.00s - 588.00s |  We talk about politics and religion
588.00s - 590.00s |  and Thanksgiving dinner, right?
590.00s - 592.00s |  That's what we should do in the red team, blue team debriefs, right?
592.00s - 594.00s |  Again, I would disagree.
594.00s - 596.00s |  Absolutely not.
596.00s - 598.00s |  And, yeah, I agree
598.00s - 600.00s |  family dinner gathering can be messy.
600.00s - 602.00s |  I would suggest to think about
602.00s - 604.00s |  it as, like, you know, potluck
604.00s - 606.00s |  when friends, right,
606.00s - 608.00s |  keeping their best dishes.
608.00s - 610.00s |  For red team, it would be, like, you know,
610.00s - 612.00s |  what intrusion tactics
612.00s - 614.00s |  they come up with this time.
614.00s - 616.00s |  For blue team, what defense
616.00s - 618.00s |  strategies they had.
618.00s - 620.00s |  And it's really cool when you have
620.00s - 622.00s |  this aha moment
622.00s - 624.00s |  in the room on
624.00s - 626.00s |  red versus blue exercise debriefs.
626.00s - 628.00s |  It's like, you know,
628.00s - 630.00s |  you want to see this excitement
630.00s - 632.00s |  in your team members that, like,
632.00s - 634.00s |  oh, that's how you do that.
634.00s - 636.00s |  So next time, I won't let it fly.
636.00s - 638.00s |  But red team also
638.00s - 640.00s |  wants to be sneakier and sneakier.
640.00s - 642.00s |  So, again,
642.00s - 644.00s |  it's all about shared wins.
644.00s - 646.00s |  Agreed.
646.00s - 648.00s |  Now, so, it's, you know, coming back to Nick
648.00s - 650.00s |  on the end, it's all about winning the election,
650.00s - 652.00s |  right? Oh, wait, no. We're talking about the
652.00s - 654.00s |  Super Bowl, right? Right? It's like
654.00s - 656.00s |  the team, the teamwork,
656.00s - 658.00s |  you know, together, right? How we all together,
658.00s - 660.00s |  how we adapt, right? And
660.00s - 662.00s |  at the same time, he's talking about stealth, things like
662.00s - 664.00s |  you've got to be agile to switch tactics
664.00s - 666.00s |  and other types of things. But
666.00s - 668.00s |  offensive defense on a football team,
668.00s - 670.00s |  we celebrate what?
670.00s - 672.00s |  Shared victories. Exactly.
673.00s - 675.00s |  There's only one goal, one trophy.
675.00s - 677.00s |  It's the team, you know, working together.
677.00s - 681.08s |  So, yeah, what's
681.08s - 683.08s |  our takeaway?
683.08s - 685.08s |  First of all, it's
685.08s - 687.08s |  all about culture. So,
687.08s - 689.08s |  first and foremost, stop
689.08s - 691.08s |  this blaming culture within the organization.
691.08s - 693.08s |  Think about collaboration.
693.08s - 695.08s |  Think about family gathering.
695.08s - 697.08s |  And teach
697.08s - 699.08s |  your leadership to be better
699.08s - 701.08s |  in this, to deliver this message to all
701.08s - 703.08s |  the team, because we always need to
703.08s - 705.08s |  keep this bigger picture in mind.
705.08s - 707.08s |  Absolutely. You know, I think
707.08s - 709.08s |  as Sveta calls out, there's an element that
709.08s - 711.08s |  management has to understand what does success look
711.08s - 713.08s |  like? Success looks like
713.08s - 715.08s |  by being a team, working together,
715.08s - 717.08s |  continually improving, because we're
717.08s - 719.08s |  frenemies, right? In that
719.08s - 721.08s |  we're always going to improve, right?
721.08s - 723.08s |  Is the red team, they're always going to get
723.08s - 725.08s |  in. The blue team is always going to
725.08s - 727.08s |  grow. There's always going to be opportunities, right?
727.08s - 729.08s |  And so that's so very important.
729.08s - 731.08s |  And in the end, also, it's just
731.08s - 733.08s |  like when the attackers, whether it's
733.08s - 735.08s |  the red team or the outsiders,
735.08s - 737.08s |  you monitor. Don't panic.
737.08s - 739.08s |  Think about it. Watch carefully,
739.08s - 741.08s |  because that's where the greatest learning comes from,
741.08s - 743.08s |  right? You can always stop,
743.08s - 745.08s |  just like in a military exercise, when the time is
745.08s - 747.08s |  right, but it's all about learning.
747.08s - 749.08s |  Yeah. So, our
749.08s - 751.08s |  suggestion would be to master
751.08s - 753.08s |  the art of being frenemies,
753.08s - 755.08s |  real frenemies, taking care
755.08s - 757.08s |  about each other.
757.08s - 759.08s |  Thank you, everybody.
