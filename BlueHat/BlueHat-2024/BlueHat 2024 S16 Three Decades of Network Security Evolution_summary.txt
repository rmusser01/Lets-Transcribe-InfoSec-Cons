**Introduction to Network Security Evolution**
- The talk focuses on how the **network security landscape** has evolved over the past three decades.
- Discusses the **challenges of defending networks** and the rapid arrival of new threats.
- Explores the **deployment of security improvements** and what attackers typically target.

**Data and Analysis**
- Presentation includes data from **large operational environments**.
- Discusses the **changes in network security** from the 1990s to the modern era.
- Emphasizes the importance of understanding **invariant factors** in network changes.

**Historical Data Examination**
- In the 1980s, network data showed **exponential growth** at 80% per year.
- **Usenet bulletin board** data showed significant growth post-1992.
- **Log-linear plots** revealed exponential growth patterns.

**1990s to Early 2000s: Network Security Events**
- The **1990s** were marked by **abuse of network systems** for pornography and stolen software.
- **2001** marked the beginning of the **modern worm era** with the Code Red worm.
- Network scanning activity increased **dramatically overnight** in 2001.

**Modern Era Developments**
- **IPv4 and IPv6**: IPv4 still dominates; IPv6 adoption is minimal.
- **NTP servers** added to the global pool resulted in sudden traffic increases.
- **Scanning activities**: Indiscriminate scanning remains prevalent.

**The Rise of Encryption**
- **Encryption growth** is a key focus in network security.
- **QUIC and TLS** protocols are examined for their prevalence in network traffic.
- **TLS 1.3** adoption is increasing but still not universally deployed.

**Security Technology and Challenges**
- Technologies such as **SMB v3** face slow adoption rates.
- **QUIC protocol**, although significant, does not dominate the network landscape.
- **TLS 1.3** is on the rise, with slow but steady growth.

**Enterprise Network Insights**
- **Enterprises struggle** with adopting new technologies due to **complex operational challenges**.
- **Data from multiple enterprises** shows varied adoption rates of new protocols.
- **Security technologies** often require **years to implement** effectively.

**Conclusion**
- **Network threats and defenses** evolve at multiple paces, with some changes being rapid and others slow.
- The reality of network security is that **many technologies take time** to be broadly adopted.
- **Continuous data analysis** is essential for understanding and adapting to network security challenges.
