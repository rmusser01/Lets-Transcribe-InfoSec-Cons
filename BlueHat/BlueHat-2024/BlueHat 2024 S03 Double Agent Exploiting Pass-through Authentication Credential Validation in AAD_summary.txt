**Session Overview**
- Presented by Avihai Ben Yossef on behalf of Ilan Kalendarov and Elad Beber from Cymulate
- Focus on vulnerabilities in Microsoft Azure Active Directory's **Pass-Through Authentication (PTA)** mechanism
- Examines weaknesses in **credential validation** process
- Offers practical examples and attack scenarios
- Aims to improve security of **Azure AD** deployments

**Introduction**
- Avihai Ben Yossef: Co-founder and CTO at Cymulate
- Cymulate focuses on **attack simulation**
- Research driven by hybrid environments in enterprises

**Cloud and Hybrid Environments**
- Increasing adoption of **cloud services**
- Enterprises moving services to the cloud using **AD Connect**
- **Hybrid environments**: On-prem Active Directory and Azure AD
- **Pass-through authentication**: Critical for seamless user experience

**Pass-Through Authentication Process**
- User signs in to a cloud resource
- Redirected to **Azure AD** for authentication
- **Credentials** are validated via on-prem **domain controller**
- **PTA service** ensures user access to cloud resources

**Vulnerability Exploration**
- Two domains linked to one **Azure tenant**
- Inconsistencies in login process observed
- POC created to exploit the inconsistency
- Use of **DLL injection** to hook PTA agent functions

**Attack Demonstration**
- Injected DLL logs and manipulates credential validation
- Demonstrated ability to force authentication success
- Potential for unauthorized access to **Azure services**

**Potential Impact**
- **Unauthorized access** to Azure services
- **Credential theft** through PTA agent hooking
- Possibility of lateral movement between domains
- Risk of **privilege escalation** in cloud environments

**Mitigation Strategies**
- Implement **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- Monitor and secure **PTA agents** as critical infrastructure
- Recommended making authentication process **domain-aware**

**Collaboration with Microsoft**
- Research shared with Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)
- Suggestions made for mitigating vulnerabilities
- Acknowledged by Microsoft, though not listed as a CVE

**Conclusion**
- Research contributes to improving **Azure AD** security
- Offering insights into mitigating discovered vulnerabilities
- Encouraging collaboration to enhance security measures
