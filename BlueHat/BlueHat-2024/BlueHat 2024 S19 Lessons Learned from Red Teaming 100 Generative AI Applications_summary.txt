**BlueHat 2024 Overview**
- Event: BlueHat 2024, Session 19
- Topic: Lessons Learned from Red Teaming 100 Generative AI Applications
- Presenter: Blake Bullwinkel, Microsoft AI Red Team

**AI Red Teaming Insights**
- **Definition**: Emulating adversarial attacks to find security vulnerabilities.
- **Microsoft's AI Red Team**: Established in 2018, conducted over 80 operations on 100+ AI products.
- **Tools**: Use of OSS automation tool PyRIT to save time on manual probing.

**Key Lessons from Red Teaming**
- **Prompt Injection and Security Failures**: Traditional security issues remain critical alongside prompt injections.
- **Evolving Risks with Model Advancements**: As models improve, associated risks evolve.
- **LLM Guided Red Teaming**: Helps cover risk landscape but can be unpredictable.
- **Trade-offs in AI Safety**: Efforts to make AI safe come with trade-offs, e.g., smaller models are less susceptible to jailbreaks.

**Challenges in AI Safety**
- **Simple Attacks' Impact**: Even simple attacks can have significant consequences.
- **Distinguishing Failures**: Difficulty in differentiating between inadvertent and intentional failures in AI systems.

**Example Operations and Tools**
- **PHY3 Language Models**: Example of Red Teaming to test for responsible AI harms.
- **Break-Fix Cycle**: Iterative process to make AI models safer by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.

**Lessons on AI System Testing**
1. **Understanding System Capabilities**: Critical for anticipating potential harms and testing vulnerabilities.
2. **Attacks Without Gradients**: Simple prompt engineering can be effective without complex techniques.
3. **System-Level Thinking**: Consider the broader application beyond just the AI model for more realistic attacks.

**Automation and Human Element**
- **Automation**: Tools like Pirate enhance testing capabilities and efficiency.
- **Human Expertise**: Essential for deep subject matter understanding, cultural competence, and emotional intelligence.

**Responsible AI and Security**
- **Pervasiveness of AI Harms**: AI harms are prevalent but challenging to quantify and address.
- **Amplification of Risks by LLMs**: LLMs introduce new security vulnerabilities and amplify existing ones.

**Final Thoughts on AI Safety**
- **Continuous Evolution**: AI safety and security are ongoing challenges that require constant adaptation.
- **Economic Perspective**: Raising the cost of attacks through effective defenses and regulation.
- **Community Engagement**: Encouragement to think about the future of AI technology and its implications.

**Open Questions for Consideration**
- **Adapting Practices**: How to update red teaming practices for new capabilities and risks.
- **Multilingual and Cultural Contexts**: Translating practices into different linguistic and cultural settings.
- **Standardization of Practices**: Need for standardization to improve communication and effectiveness across organizations.
