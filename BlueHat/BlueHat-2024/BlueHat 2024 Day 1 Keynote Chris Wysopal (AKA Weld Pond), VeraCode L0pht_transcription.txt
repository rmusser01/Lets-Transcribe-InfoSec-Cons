 All right. Thanks everybody for being here.
2.08s - 4.80s |  We have a great show lined up for you.
4.80s - 8.28s |  A couple of things, Blue Hat by the Numbers.
8.28s - 12.84s |  We have attendees and presenters from 20 different countries.
12.84s - 15.16s |  So thanks for making the journey.
15.16s - 18.52s |  There's a large majority of you that have attended
18.52s - 22.22s |  Blue Hat before many times multiple,
22.22s - 24.96s |  and there's over 250 people
24.96s - 28.36s |  here where this is their first Blue Hat.
28.36s - 32.56s |  I'd like to give a big thanks to the Call for Papers board.
32.56s - 34.72s |  We received over a 100 submissions.
34.72s - 36.60s |  They were really high quality.
36.60s - 39.06s |  That's why we have such a good lineup.
39.06s - 41.16s |  But it's a lot of work to go through
41.16s - 44.96s |  and read up on all those talks.
44.96s - 49.06s |  So since the last time we had Blue Hat in Redmond,
49.06s - 52.00s |  it's been quite an eventful year.
52.36s - 56.36s |  Right after Blue Hat last year,
57.32s - 62.08s |  we started this thing called the Secure Future Initiative.
62.08s - 65.20s |  The theme that you see for Blue Hat is you see
65.20s - 68.84s |  the security above all else and that's from Satya Nadella
68.84s - 70.52s |  talking to all the employees
70.52s - 72.76s |  about the Secure Future Initiative.
72.76s - 77.56s |  So we started the SFI or Secure Future Initiative in November.
77.56s - 80.56s |  We started making progress and then we really
80.56s - 85.36s |  expanded SFI in May of this year.
85.36s - 89.96s |  Really, SFI is about changing the culture of
89.96s - 92.28s |  the company and helping protect
92.28s - 95.32s |  Microsoft or customers in the global community.
95.32s - 98.64s |  But it really starts with changing the culture.
98.64s - 103.92s |  So part of changing the culture is learning,
103.92s - 106.14s |  thinking about different perspectives,
106.14s - 107.96s |  and really thinking about
107.96s - 110.84s |  the best way that we can protect folks.
111.60s - 115.68s |  For me, I really like to think about
115.68s - 119.64s |  different perspectives as part of my learning journey.
119.80s - 122.40s |  Early on in my career,
122.40s - 127.40s |  Microsoft was not as invested in security as they are today.
127.40s - 130.44s |  There was a time in the early 2000s
130.44s - 133.88s |  when Microsoft had IIS that was out there.
133.88s - 135.72s |  There were other things going on.
135.72s - 140.56s |  We also had MSN as a dial-up service,
140.56s - 143.56s |  and we were competing with AOL.
143.56s - 147.56s |  At that time, I remember going into the copy room in
147.56s - 152.68s |  a Microsoft employee-only area and there was a sign-up that said,
152.68s - 155.88s |  friends don't let friends use AOL,
155.88s - 161.68s |  and an employee had graffitied in underneath or use IIS.
161.68s - 166.56s |  That's because there were so many compromises of IIS 5.
166.56s - 169.12s |  So there were people,
169.12s - 170.20s |  we needed help, right?
170.20s - 172.04s |  Microsoft wasn't doing so great.
172.04s - 176.12s |  We needed help, we didn't have the security expertise,
176.12s - 180.48s |  and so we started to bring in people with different perspectives.
180.48s - 184.96s |  Sometimes these folks were not always big proponents,
184.96s - 186.80s |  big advocates for Microsoft,
186.80s - 189.48s |  but they were big advocates for security.
189.48s - 194.04s |  One of those groups that they brought in was At Stake.
194.04s - 198.52s |  At Stake really focused on how can we
198.52s - 202.72s |  secure IIS for this IIS 6 release.
202.72s - 208.24s |  So with that, I'd like to introduce our keynote speaker,
208.24s - 210.40s |  Chris Wysopol.
210.40s - 213.36s |  Many of you may know him as Weldpond.
213.36s - 219.00s |  He is from a hacker group from the 90s called The Loft.
219.00s - 220.72s |  So some people may think about
220.72s - 223.76s |  Loft Crack and all these different things.
223.76s - 226.20s |  So Chris was one of the people that came to
226.20s - 230.80s |  Microsoft and helped us on that journey with IIS.
230.80s - 234.00s |  But he'll tell you about many of the other things
234.00s - 237.80s |  that he's helped the industry and Microsoft with.
237.80s - 245.42s |  So with that, I'd like to welcome Chris Wysopol.
245.42s - 251.17s |  Thank you, Tom. It's great to be here.
251.17s - 253.45s |  This is my third Blue Hat.
253.45s - 256.81s |  I was actually at the first Blue Hat in 2005.
256.81s - 259.61s |  I ran into Michael Howard out there and he
259.61s - 261.81s |  reminded me that he has a picture of me with
261.81s - 266.73s |  H.D. Moore and Dan Kaminsky from the first Blue Hat.
266.73s - 273.09s |  It made me redouble my reason for wanting to do this topic,
273.09s - 275.17s |  which is before we lose the history
275.17s - 277.45s |  and more of our colleagues,
277.45s - 281.65s |  I want to talk about how we got to this point where hackers are
281.65s - 285.65s |  collaborating with product companies like Microsoft
285.65s - 289.73s |  and how we actually,
289.73s - 292.29s |  a lot of us work for Microsoft or
292.29s - 294.57s |  work for other companies that build software.
294.57s - 296.81s |  A lot of us are independent researchers,
296.81s - 299.69s |  but that collaboration is really here today.
299.69s - 301.65s |  But it wasn't a foregone conclusion
301.65s - 303.49s |  that this was going to happen.
303.49s - 306.49s |  This collaboration actually came from somewhere.
306.49s - 310.53s |  In the 90s, I would say it was pretty divisive.
310.53s - 313.77s |  As Tom said, there was some big problems
313.77s - 318.29s |  with Microsoft products around 2000,
318.29s - 320.33s |  when they were starting to get popular,
320.33s - 325.49s |  and Microsoft frankly needed help.
325.49s - 329.65s |  But they wouldn't have had anyone to call that they could
329.65s - 335.37s |  trust unless the communities had come together over time.
335.37s - 337.21s |  I like to start off with
337.21s - 339.29s |  this picture because it's just like a point in time.
339.29s - 340.97s |  I'm going to go back further than this,
340.97s - 342.73s |  but this was in 1998,
342.73s - 344.45s |  where me and my colleagues from
344.45s - 347.57s |  the loft testified before the US Senate,
347.57s - 351.77s |  and just this moment in time where hackers were trusted to give
351.77s - 355.97s |  a voice and have an opinion about computer government security.
355.97s - 358.89s |  This was the first hearing on computer government security.
358.89s - 360.05s |  They had representatives from
360.05s - 363.29s |  the General Accounting Office that were auditing departments.
363.29s - 365.13s |  They had representatives from think tanks
365.13s - 367.17s |  like Peter Neumann from SRI,
367.17s - 370.09s |  and then they had a bunch of hackers that found
370.09s - 373.69s |  vulnerabilities and were doing full disclosure at the time.
373.69s - 377.17s |  That's me there if you're trying to figure out.
377.17s - 381.57s |  A little bit of hair changes have happened to the group here.
381.57s - 385.05s |  I think I have the third longest hair here.
385.05s - 387.01s |  I'm not quite sure.
387.01s - 389.65s |  But I always like to say,
389.65s - 391.81s |  how did I get to this point?
391.81s - 396.45s |  How did I get into this group that was invited?
396.45s - 401.61s |  I think that the simple answer is we made trouble.
401.61s - 404.29s |  We made trouble by doing full disclosure,
404.29s - 406.21s |  by talking about problems,
406.21s - 411.05s |  by taking a consumer advocacy approach and saying,
411.05s - 414.09s |  we don't think we should live in this world with
414.09s - 417.29s |  vulnerable software and something has to change.
417.29s - 419.49s |  We're still living in the world of vulnerable software.
419.49s - 420.61s |  It's gotten a lot better,
420.61s - 426.13s |  but it was really bad back in the 90s.
426.13s - 431.73s |  We made trouble enough that the media paid attention to us
431.73s - 434.37s |  and listened to us such that we got into
434.37s - 437.73s |  the press like the New York Times and the Washington Post.
437.73s - 440.73s |  When it came time to discuss
440.73s - 444.29s |  computer security at one of the highest government levels,
444.29s - 446.01s |  they said, we need to hear from these guys.
446.01s - 448.89s |  We need to hear their opinion on this.
448.89s - 453.81s |  This really showed that hackers had a voice that could help.
453.81s - 458.65s |  That was a big moment in starting to build that trust where
458.65s - 460.77s |  companies and the government could
460.77s - 463.65s |  start to trust what we were saying.
463.65s - 465.57s |  We weren't just doing this to wreak
465.57s - 468.25s |  havoc and to cause problems for people
468.25s - 472.73s |  and give information to wormwriters.
472.73s - 475.13s |  That wasn't the intention.
475.21s - 478.69s |  So now, I'm going to go way back to the beginning.
478.69s - 481.77s |  When I started on my computer security journey,
481.77s - 484.25s |  which was really in the early 90s,
484.25s - 485.93s |  this is what we had.
485.93s - 490.49s |  We had the orange book from the DOD talking
490.49s - 492.49s |  about how do you assess a system for
492.49s - 496.13s |  security design and looking for all those security features.
496.13s - 498.57s |  This book doesn't talk about bugs at all.
498.57s - 500.53s |  There's no such thing. Buffer overflow
500.53s - 502.57s |  wasn't even really public knowledge at this time.
502.57s - 504.45s |  This questions whether the NSA knew about
504.45s - 508.49s |  buffer overflows and exploiting them.
508.49s - 510.81s |  But that didn't exist.
510.85s - 514.29s |  That was something that hackers figured out.
514.29s - 518.13s |  Al F1, Elias Levy published a paper in,
518.13s - 519.37s |  I think it was 95,
519.37s - 521.29s |  how to exploit buffer overflows.
521.29s - 524.89s |  So hackers actually contributed hugely to
524.89s - 527.25s |  the idea of how to secure systems by saying,
527.25s - 530.01s |  well, this is something that you're not considering,
530.01s - 531.53s |  and this is something that bypasses
531.53s - 534.01s |  all these security features and design.
534.01s - 538.73s |  Then the other big entity we had back then was CERT,
538.73s - 541.53s |  which was formed after the Morse worm.
541.53s - 544.61s |  The idea for CERT was they would help
544.61s - 546.89s |  coordinate when a vulnerability was
546.89s - 549.37s |  found in Unix or in some Internet protocol,
549.37s - 550.69s |  they would coordinate that.
550.69s - 552.93s |  Then they started doing products too.
552.93s - 554.29s |  If you found a vulnerability in
554.29s - 555.85s |  a product in the early 90s,
555.85s - 560.25s |  you'd send it to CERT and it just would disappear.
560.25s - 562.45s |  It was just like a one-way,
562.45s - 564.05s |  when you're dealing with someone in
564.05s - 566.65s |  the government and they have clearance and you don't.
566.65s - 568.09s |  You tell them stuff and they don't
568.09s - 569.25s |  tell you anything back.
569.25s - 572.17s |  That's how vulnerability disclosure was in the beginning.
572.17s - 573.41s |  They're like, this is great.
573.41s - 575.21s |  Does anyone else know about this bug?
575.21s - 577.21s |  No. Okay, we'll make sure the vendor knows
577.21s - 579.49s |  that no one else knows about this bug except you.
579.49s - 581.05s |  What do you think that meant? That meant
581.05s - 583.57s |  that there was no coordination.
583.57s - 585.37s |  The bug didn't necessarily get fixed.
585.37s - 587.69s |  If it did get fixed, it could have gotten silently fixed.
587.69s - 590.17s |  How would anyone even know they needed to patch?
590.17s - 593.81s |  So this is how vulnerability disclosure
593.81s - 597.81s |  was before really full disclosure became a thing,
597.81s - 599.09s |  and we said, hey, wait a minute,
599.09s - 601.25s |  people should know about
601.25s - 605.41s |  this problem because that's a way to actually get it fixed.
605.85s - 608.65s |  Then another formative paper,
608.65s - 610.13s |  I don't know, everyone should read
610.13s - 612.73s |  this paper because this was really formative to me.
612.73s - 617.17s |  This was the first time that I saw that adversarial and
617.17s - 621.81s |  offensive security was really brought and documented,
621.81s - 624.37s |  improving the security of your site by breaking into it.
624.37s - 627.09s |  So Dan Farmer, who was at Sun at the time,
627.09s - 629.17s |  and Weetzie Venema, who was an academic,
629.17s - 631.37s |  later worked at IBM.
631.37s - 634.29s |  Basically, they collected all the ways
634.29s - 636.53s |  that they saw hackers breaching systems.
636.53s - 638.81s |  They said, let's collect all of these things.
638.81s - 640.77s |  They use a misconfiguration here
640.77s - 643.05s |  because the default configuration wasn't changed,
643.05s - 648.65s |  or they misused trust or other things,
648.65s - 651.45s |  or something wasn't patched.
651.45s - 653.45s |  Let's collect all those things,
653.45s - 655.73s |  and then we will try them.
655.89s - 658.61s |  The beginning of network penetration testing
658.61s - 660.97s |  and host penetration testing.
660.97s - 663.97s |  They documented this approach back,
663.97s - 666.81s |  I think, in 1991.
666.81s - 672.65s |  Then came hackers writing tools in the early and mid-90s.
672.65s - 676.21s |  These tools could be used for offensive reasons.
676.21s - 677.97s |  You could break into a system with this,
677.97s - 679.65s |  but we all know that you can break
679.65s - 681.89s |  into a system in order to secure it.
681.89s - 687.49s |  So Alec Muffet wrote Crack because he wanted to see
687.49s - 690.45s |  if there were weak passwords people were using.
690.45s - 692.85s |  At the time, people started
692.85s - 694.97s |  using this to secure their systems.
694.97s - 696.89s |  If you were a system administrator,
696.89s - 698.37s |  you said, yeah, I don't want my users
698.37s - 699.97s |  using guessable passwords.
699.97s - 701.97s |  I want to use Crack to do that.
701.97s - 703.25s |  I don't know that there was
703.25s - 705.49s |  no password quality mechanisms back then.
705.49s - 706.69s |  I want to see if they're using
706.69s - 709.69s |  guessable passwords, known passwords.
710.69s - 715.73s |  People who actually did this like Randall Schwartz at Intel,
715.73s - 718.45s |  he got fired and charged with a felony for doing this
718.45s - 721.45s |  on a system that he was the administrator of.
721.45s - 723.37s |  He was the administrator,
723.37s - 725.49s |  and he thought this was a way to secure the system,
725.49s - 727.33s |  and they said, oh, you broke the policy.
727.33s - 731.49s |  You can't discover someone else's password.
731.49s - 733.65s |  So we had a clash there.
733.65s - 736.49s |  The policy prevented you from
736.49s - 739.97s |  doing the thing to secure the system.
739.97s - 742.89s |  Now, today, not allowing
742.89s - 745.01s |  guessable passwords or known passwords
745.01s - 747.05s |  is part of the NIST standard.
747.05s - 748.61s |  That's something that we try to do,
748.61s - 749.45s |  and we try to do that with
749.45s - 751.81s |  password quality tests instead of cracking.
751.81s - 753.17s |  But back then, you had to crack.
753.17s - 755.01s |  That was the only way to do it.
755.01s - 758.01s |  Dan Farmer and Weetzie Venema took
758.01s - 759.57s |  their paper and all these
759.57s - 763.05s |  different attacks that they were seeing,
763.05s - 765.73s |  and they scripted them up, and they built Satan.
765.73s - 767.65s |  They scripted it up, and they released it as
767.65s - 771.41s |  a tool to hack into systems in order to secure them.
771.41s - 774.61s |  Well, this didn't go over very well at SGI,
774.61s - 776.25s |  Silicon Graphics, where Dan Farmer
776.25s - 778.13s |  worked at the time, and he got fired.
778.13s - 780.49s |  He got fired for releasing a tool
780.49s - 782.29s |  that is essentially a
782.29s - 784.29s |  multibillion-dollar industry today.
784.29s - 786.41s |  We all use attack surface management
786.41s - 788.05s |  and vulnerability scanning.
788.05s - 789.97s |  It's a multibillion-dollar industry.
789.97s - 791.89s |  But when it was first introduced,
791.89s - 794.49s |  it was seen as something that was bad
794.49s - 798.65s |  by these major companies like SGI.
798.65s - 802.21s |  Then a tool which actually has been
802.21s - 805.89s |  flagged a bit for being malware, Netcat.
805.89s - 807.49s |  The network Swiss Army Knife,
807.49s - 808.85s |  which really lets you set up
808.85s - 812.05s |  connections, and Haber wrote this in 96.
812.05s - 814.33s |  I ported it to Windows in 97,
814.33s - 816.33s |  and I found three vulnerabilities
816.33s - 817.61s |  just because I had a new tool,
817.61s - 820.17s |  and I could look at sockets and connections.
820.17s - 821.49s |  One of them was pretty bad.
821.49s - 823.85s |  It allowed you to, in Windows NT,
823.85s - 825.73s |  as a user process,
825.73s - 828.77s |  you could bind to a port that
828.77s - 832.93s |  the admin had bound to,
832.93s - 835.01s |  like port 80 or port 25,
835.01s - 836.25s |  and you could bind in front of it.
836.25s - 837.37s |  Like if you bound later,
837.37s - 840.13s |  it lets you see the traffic afterwards.
840.13s - 841.53s |  You couldn't really do that unless you had
841.53s - 843.77s |  a tool that allowed you to explore these things.
843.77s - 846.53s |  So, I look at these tools as things that were
846.53s - 849.25s |  absolutely necessary to
849.25s - 850.85s |  get the security where we are today,
850.85s - 853.73s |  but at the time, they were pretty scary.
854.13s - 857.97s |  Then, hackers started writing commercial software.
858.85s - 860.93s |  They took the ideas of
860.93s - 862.49s |  these freeware software and said,
862.49s - 864.81s |  let's write commercial software.
864.81s - 867.85s |  ISS, founded by Chris Klaus,
867.85s - 869.73s |  he's hung out on PoundHack.
869.73s - 871.77s |  He went to all the different forums,
871.77s - 873.93s |  read BugTrack, and started collecting
873.93s - 875.65s |  all these attacks and making
875.65s - 878.45s |  a commercial product to do this.
878.45s - 880.97s |  Same thing that Dan Farmer got fired for.
880.97s - 883.57s |  At The Loft, we took our research
883.57s - 885.97s |  into weak passwords and weak password storage,
885.97s - 889.77s |  like the Landman hashes in Windows NT,
889.77s - 892.29s |  and wrote a product so people could actually
892.29s - 896.13s |  audit their passwords on their system.
896.13s - 897.57s |  That's our little banner ad down
897.57s - 899.65s |  there with the sniff crack faster.
899.65s - 901.21s |  We actually wrote a sniffer that could
901.21s - 903.85s |  sniff the SMB transactions,
903.85s - 908.09s |  and I think it was NTLM v1 was very weak,
908.09s - 909.53s |  and if you sniffed it, you could
910.49s - 916.41s |  actually crack the challenge response.
916.41s - 919.69s |  Then, of course, we had hacker information resources.
919.69s - 922.53s |  I think this is where we first started to come
922.53s - 925.53s |  together with the government security people
925.53s - 931.61s |  and the tech vendor security people started to come together.
931.61s - 934.01s |  BugTrack was the place you disclose vulnerabilities,
934.01s - 935.81s |  and you talked about these vulnerabilities,
935.81s - 938.01s |  and it lasted from,
938.01s - 941.01s |  I think, 94 to 99 or so.
941.01s - 942.81s |  I started to see some of
942.81s - 945.17s |  the Microsoft people show up on this list.
945.17s - 947.69s |  Paul Leach, who was one of the architects of
947.69s - 950.93s |  NT and SMB protocol on the Internet,
950.93s - 954.01s |  was there, Michael Howard,
954.01s - 959.21s |  and others started to communicate there.
959.21s - 961.69s |  MSRC, when it showed up in 98,
961.69s - 964.85s |  started to actually interact with
964.85s - 967.61s |  these people posting things on BugTrack.
967.61s - 968.89s |  Then, of course, DEF CON,
968.89s - 972.09s |  we started to see it wasn't just a hacker conference.
972.09s - 974.25s |  By the time 97 rolled around,
974.25s - 977.09s |  it was starting to become a professional conference.
977.09s - 978.73s |  So, we had the professionals coming to
978.73s - 980.93s |  the places that hackers had set up,
980.93s - 982.77s |  like BugTrack and DEF CON.
982.77s - 985.93s |  The professionals were coming to learn from
985.93s - 988.89s |  what hackers were doing and so much that
988.89s - 992.73s |  DEF CON spun off into Black Hat in
992.73s - 997.77s |  1997 and became a separate conference because,
997.77s - 1000.49s |  I think, Jeff Moss decided that he could get
1000.49s - 1002.89s |  more commercial people to come and
1002.89s - 1006.77s |  pay $1,500 instead of $150,
1006.77s - 1008.33s |  and come to a professional conference.
1008.33s - 1009.89s |  It was a very good business idea,
1009.89s - 1014.17s |  but it also brought these communities much more
1014.17s - 1016.41s |  together because you had speakers
1016.41s - 1020.17s |  from both communities attending.
1020.33s - 1023.93s |  At the very first Black Hat,
1023.93s - 1026.33s |  we actually had a sit-down
1026.33s - 1030.01s |  between The Loft and Microsoft.
1030.01s - 1032.45s |  This is a little bit of history that I don't want to
1032.45s - 1038.01s |  get lost and this picture
1038.01s - 1042.17s |  was actually in a magazine called EE Times.
1042.17s - 1044.37s |  This writer did an interview
1044.37s - 1046.89s |  with Mudge and Hobbit afterwards.
1046.89s - 1048.69s |  So, Mudge and Hobbit were part of
1048.69s - 1052.49s |  The Loft, Paul Leach from Microsoft,
1052.49s - 1054.41s |  Yobi Benjamin was there.
1054.41s - 1056.01s |  He kind of brokered the deal.
1056.01s - 1058.17s |  He was like, hey, I think we can get
1058.17s - 1060.73s |  together because he was a hacker,
1060.73s - 1062.37s |  but also worked at
1062.37s - 1066.21s |  Cambridge Technology Solutions as a consultant.
1066.41s - 1070.69s |  One of the Windows NT marketing executives,
1070.69s - 1073.01s |  Carl Karanen was there.
1073.01s - 1075.21s |  They had a discussion of
1075.21s - 1078.37s |  Hobbit's paper and Hobbit's presentation,
1078.37s - 1080.13s |  where he basically was talking about
1080.13s - 1081.89s |  all the weaknesses and the protocol
1081.89s - 1083.85s |  was called CIFS at the time,
1083.85s - 1086.69s |  which is basically SMB that will work over
1086.69s - 1090.33s |  the Internet with TCP IP addressing.
1090.33s - 1092.81s |  Things like poor session management,
1092.81s - 1095.49s |  and a lot of information disclosure,
1095.49s - 1098.61s |  and things that could be improved.
1098.61s - 1102.69s |  Paul Leach wanted to find out how are we doing this?
1102.69s - 1105.17s |  What are we doing this? Why are we doing this?
1105.17s - 1107.85s |  Because we don't work for Microsoft.
1107.85s - 1110.25s |  We're just doing this because we think, hey,
1110.25s - 1112.25s |  if people are using this protocol
1112.25s - 1113.37s |  that has these weaknesses,
1113.37s - 1114.37s |  people should know about it.
1114.37s - 1116.61s |  People should know about the weaknesses in it.
1116.61s - 1118.61s |  That was like a new concept.
1118.61s - 1120.25s |  This was a new concept for
1120.25s - 1122.93s |  these Microsoft people to come and
1122.93s - 1126.93s |  understand why we were doing what we were doing.
1126.93s - 1129.65s |  We don't have malicious intent.
1129.65s - 1132.09s |  We actually coined the term gray hat at
1132.09s - 1134.41s |  The Loft because we didn't want to
1134.41s - 1136.73s |  necessarily be seen as people that were
1136.73s - 1140.21s |  consultants that worked for an IBM,
1140.21s - 1142.17s |  that went and did consulting,
1142.17s - 1144.41s |  and helped you secure your system.
1144.41s - 1146.61s |  We also didn't want to be seen as a black hat,
1146.61s - 1150.41s |  someone who is just writing exploits to break into systems,
1150.41s - 1152.57s |  writing tools just to break into systems.
1152.57s - 1154.17s |  We were writing these tools that could be
1154.17s - 1155.97s |  used for offense or defense.
1155.97s - 1158.89s |  We thought that that was necessary in order to get
1158.89s - 1163.05s |  the information out there to everybody like open source.
1163.05s - 1164.61s |  ISS is a commercial tool,
1164.61s - 1165.61s |  can be used for defense,
1165.61s - 1166.89s |  but not everyone can afford it,
1166.89s - 1168.97s |  not everyone has access to it.
1168.97s - 1170.73s |  A tool like Satan,
1170.73s - 1171.81s |  everyone can look at,
1171.81s - 1173.09s |  everyone can build upon.
1173.09s - 1176.85s |  So the open source aspect we thought really
1176.85s - 1182.86s |  helped with getting things to be secure.
1182.86s - 1187.06s |  Then we got this beautiful cover on the ET Times,
1187.06s - 1188.90s |  a picture of us in our loft,
1188.90s - 1190.22s |  which was a physical space.
1190.22s - 1191.62s |  That was one of the ways that
1191.62s - 1192.82s |  loft was different than a lot of
1192.82s - 1194.38s |  the other hacker groups at the time.
1194.38s - 1196.82s |  We actually had a physical space where we set up
1196.82s - 1199.62s |  a networking lab where we could load software,
1199.62s - 1201.10s |  and we could sniff software,
1201.10s - 1203.94s |  and we had debuggers all ready to go,
1203.94s - 1206.22s |  and people could come and actually
1206.22s - 1208.86s |  do vulnerability research on our systems.
1208.86s - 1212.42s |  Because back then, having a set up of computers,
1212.42s - 1214.54s |  having a domain controller,
1214.54s - 1216.82s |  having these different things available
1216.82s - 1218.38s |  was not something that the average person
1218.38s - 1219.94s |  could have at home.
1219.94s - 1225.06s |  Computing is a lot cheaper now than it was back in 1997.
1225.06s - 1226.62s |  So we talked with the ET Times
1226.62s - 1228.22s |  about how we were doing this,
1228.22s - 1230.38s |  how we were setting this up and publicizing,
1230.38s - 1233.78s |  how do you do vulnerability research at scale?
1235.58s - 1241.18s |  I decided to take a riff off of Weetzy and Dan Farmer,
1241.18s - 1244.50s |  and say, we're not securing our site by breaking into it,
1244.50s - 1246.78s |  we're securing our product by breaking into it.
1246.78s - 1248.98s |  That was the way that we started to think about,
1248.98s - 1251.78s |  how do you secure software?
1251.78s - 1256.42s |  You break into it. So we
1256.42s - 1258.18s |  released a lot of advisories,
1258.18s - 1260.10s |  and it wasn't until 2000 that we
1260.10s - 1263.78s |  actually did coordinated disclosure.
1263.78s - 1267.22s |  We released full disclosure and vendors like
1267.22s - 1268.62s |  Microsoft found out on
1268.62s - 1271.26s |  BugTrack just like everyone else.
1271.38s - 1273.34s |  But as time went on,
1273.34s - 1277.42s |  we didn't ship exploit code,
1277.42s - 1278.74s |  because we started to think that
1278.74s - 1281.22s |  exploit code was just going a little too far.
1281.22s - 1283.78s |  That made it too easy for people
1284.30s - 1287.78s |  to exploit these problems.
1289.18s - 1292.94s |  This is Mudge, one of the colleagues from the loft.
1292.94s - 1295.54s |  At the time, his quote is,
1295.54s - 1297.54s |  we felt that users had the right to know about
1297.54s - 1299.82s |  these vulnerabilities so they could protect themselves,
1299.82s - 1303.02s |  especially when vendors were not taking action.
1303.02s - 1306.78s |  There was a time when a lot of vendors didn't take action.
1306.78s - 1309.10s |  Microsoft was one of the first to take action,
1309.10s - 1312.98s |  but there was times that other vendors,
1312.98s - 1315.90s |  I don't want to necessarily mention any names,
1315.90s - 1317.54s |  but they wouldn't take action
1317.54s - 1320.30s |  until enough of their customers got upset.
1320.30s - 1322.38s |  Like the first question was,
1322.38s - 1324.70s |  do any of our customers know about this?
1324.70s - 1328.54s |  You're like, no, no one else knows about it.
1328.70s - 1331.14s |  When that question gets asked,
1331.14s - 1333.54s |  you know nothing's going to happen.
1333.54s - 1335.94s |  When a lot of customers knew about something,
1335.94s - 1338.86s |  it did get fixed rather quickly.
1338.86s - 1342.70s |  So I had my own personal journey along with
1342.70s - 1349.02s |  the loft where I went from a time of full disclosure,
1349.02s - 1351.06s |  including exploit code,
1351.06s - 1355.22s |  and then realizing after I started going to conferences,
1355.22s - 1356.54s |  talking to customers,
1356.54s - 1359.30s |  really engaging with the people who are trying to
1359.30s - 1362.58s |  defend their networks and their systems,
1362.58s - 1365.02s |  that there had to be a compromise.
1365.02s - 1366.86s |  There had to be a compromise with,
1366.86s - 1368.82s |  we want to get the word out there that
1368.82s - 1371.94s |  these problems exist and this is a systemic problem.
1371.98s - 1376.62s |  We don't want everything to be a silent patch that no one
1376.62s - 1381.62s |  knows about or even knows to fix.
1381.62s - 1384.50s |  That was really the beginning of the thinking,
1384.50s - 1386.66s |  we need to think about this.
1386.66s - 1390.18s |  We need to think about a process that can benefit
1390.18s - 1395.42s |  both the community at large of computer users and
1395.42s - 1403.25s |  defenders at large and also researchers and also the vendors.
1403.61s - 1406.85s |  This really changed in 1998.
1406.85s - 1411.89s |  I mentioned people were on bug track discussing these issues.
1411.89s - 1414.01s |  Vendors started to realize
1414.01s - 1416.05s |  that they were going to have to fix things.
1416.05s - 1418.61s |  Then actually, I think it was in 98,
1418.61s - 1421.37s |  Scott Culp I think was the first director of MSRC.
1421.37s - 1425.69s |  He sent a note to me at the loft and said,
1425.69s - 1429.65s |  if you send us the information before,
1429.65s - 1432.97s |  we will fix it and let you know when we fixed it.
1432.97s - 1436.93s |  Then you can release your advisory and your proof of concept,
1436.93s - 1441.33s |  your exploit code, but let us have a chance to do this.
1441.33s - 1443.41s |  It took us a while mulling this over,
1443.41s - 1446.17s |  but Microsoft actually reached out to us and said,
1446.17s - 1449.33s |  you should do this, you should think about changing
1449.33s - 1454.69s |  the way you're behaving and Microsoft started to,
1454.69s - 1455.93s |  I actually looked this up, I said,
1455.93s - 1458.13s |  who was the first person that was acknowledged
1458.13s - 1461.09s |  by MSRC of reporting a vulnerability?
1461.13s - 1462.89s |  It was George Guninski.
1462.89s - 1464.57s |  Some of you old-timers might recognize
1464.57s - 1467.13s |  the name who's pretty prolific in the late 90s.
1467.13s - 1470.45s |  In September 98, he actually got an acknowledgement in
1470.45s - 1475.01s |  the security bulletin that he found this problem and reported it.
1475.01s - 1477.45s |  I have to tell you that went a long way
1477.45s - 1479.17s |  in if you worked at a company,
1479.17s - 1481.81s |  like you worked at a consulting company and you
1481.81s - 1484.73s |  wanted to put out an advisory
1484.73s - 1487.49s |  talking about how say Microsoft's products were wrong.
1487.49s - 1490.77s |  I can remember later when I worked at AtState
1490.77s - 1493.65s |  convincing our CEO like we should do this,
1493.65s - 1495.17s |  Microsoft will acknowledge us,
1495.17s - 1496.97s |  we'll be in their security bulletin
1496.97s - 1499.57s |  as the people who found this problem.
1499.57s - 1503.45s |  It made a huge difference to have that acknowledgement happen,
1503.45s - 1506.21s |  and I think the first time it happened was in 1998.
1506.21s - 1511.53s |  So that was a big step forward that the vendors took.
1511.53s - 1513.45s |  But there was a need for standardization.
1513.45s - 1517.25s |  It really was the wild west out there.
1517.25s - 1521.13s |  So Jeff Forrestall also went by Rainforest Puppy.
1521.13s - 1523.21s |  He built his own Satan called Whisker,
1523.21s - 1526.49s |  which actually scanned applications,
1526.49s - 1529.73s |  web applications for vulnerabilities.
1529.73s - 1534.33s |  He was the first one to codify this and write this down in June of 2000.
1534.33s - 1536.21s |  He said, and it was really
1536.21s - 1538.69s |  one-sided because he didn't collaborate with vendors.
1538.69s - 1541.29s |  He just thought from a researcher's perspective,
1541.29s - 1542.93s |  this is what I'm going to send the company
1542.93s - 1544.81s |  before I send them the information.
1544.81s - 1546.69s |  I'm going to send them my policy,
1546.69s - 1550.01s |  and I'm going to say, this is how I am willing to interact.
1550.01s - 1551.61s |  This is what I expect.
1551.61s - 1553.05s |  These are my expectations.
1553.05s - 1556.73s |  These are the things I will do if you do certain things.
1556.85s - 1561.21s |  It was the first time that someone thought
1561.21s - 1563.61s |  through how this could actually work because
1563.61s - 1565.81s |  he was disclosing a lot of things to vendors,
1565.81s - 1568.45s |  and he just wanted it to go more smoothly.
1568.45s - 1572.49s |  Then he asked for some collaboration.
1572.49s - 1576.89s |  I helped him with version 2.0 that came out in October 2000.
1576.89s - 1582.05s |  This really was the thing that people started to
1582.05s - 1588.29s |  follow and started to send with their disclosures to vendors.
1588.29s - 1590.57s |  Then in October 2001,
1590.57s - 1593.01s |  Scott Culp wrote this.
1593.01s - 1595.17s |  I'm not going to call it a diatribe,
1595.17s - 1597.21s |  but he seems like he was upset.
1597.21s - 1599.77s |  It starts off Code Red Lions,
1599.77s - 1602.49s |  S Edmund D, Raman, Nimda.
1602.49s - 1605.53s |  This was a bad year for Microsoft, right?
1605.53s - 1608.13s |  IAS 5, I mean,
1608.13s - 1610.93s |  these things were really, really bad news.
1610.93s - 1614.93s |  You were patching your IAS on a monthly basis,
1614.93s - 1616.73s |  and this was before Patch Tuesday, right?
1616.73s - 1618.81s |  This was at random times, right?
1618.81s - 1620.89s |  Because the worm is out there.
1621.29s - 1628.65s |  I think he was fed up that exploit code was being released,
1628.65s - 1633.17s |  and it made it easy for people to write worms,
1633.17s - 1635.81s |  and he was right there.
1635.81s - 1638.09s |  But one thing that this article
1638.09s - 1639.93s |  does is it uses the word responsible.
1639.93s - 1643.13s |  He says, we can and should discuss security vulnerabilities,
1643.13s - 1644.69s |  but we should be smart, prudent,
1644.69s - 1647.53s |  and responsible in the way we did it.
1647.65s - 1650.33s |  If you read more in there,
1650.33s - 1652.49s |  the responsibility was really,
1652.49s - 1654.29s |  people finding these bugs need to be
1654.29s - 1656.33s |  responsible with this information.
1656.37s - 1659.57s |  At the time, rubbed the researcher community the wrong way,
1659.57s - 1662.25s |  because we're like, we have to be responsible.
1662.25s - 1666.73s |  You guys actually ship this software and people paid for it, right?
1666.73s - 1669.57s |  Where's the responsibility on the vendor side
1669.57s - 1672.73s |  to make sure that this doesn't happen, right?
1672.73s - 1674.69s |  It was all the responsibility had to be
1674.69s - 1677.81s |  on the researcher, on the finder side.
1677.81s - 1679.65s |  That rubbed people the wrong way,
1679.65s - 1683.25s |  and this word responsible really became loaded,
1683.25s - 1685.53s |  and that's why we don't use it today.
1685.53s - 1687.89s |  We use coordinated.
1687.89s - 1690.33s |  But I used responsible.
1690.33s - 1694.77s |  When I worked with Steve Christie in 2002,
1694.77s - 1701.29s |  we just said, let's take what Rainforest Puppy had done,
1701.29s - 1703.73s |  and let's talk to vendors.
1703.73s - 1707.33s |  Let's get the vendor side of the equation,
1707.33s - 1711.05s |  and write a disclosure policy and
1711.05s - 1715.05s |  process that is balanced between researchers and vendors.
1715.05s - 1720.45s |  So we just didn't want to write this like RFP did and just publish it.
1720.45s - 1723.37s |  We wanted it to have more impact by being
1723.37s - 1726.97s |  something that was sanctioned by some sort of body.
1726.97s - 1730.33s |  We looked, and there really wasn't anything out there that was
1730.33s - 1733.85s |  a neutral body around standards that we
1733.85s - 1738.89s |  could access at the time besides the IETF.
1738.89s - 1745.29s |  So we said, let's consult with some different vendors.
1745.29s - 1748.41s |  We consulted with Marianne Davidson at Oracle.
1748.41s - 1750.69s |  We consulted with CERT.
1750.69s - 1753.17s |  We said, how do you process this?
1753.17s - 1755.65s |  How do you handle this with your vendors?
1755.65s - 1760.53s |  We took some of the things from RF policy,
1760.53s - 1764.29s |  and we wrote this IETF RFC,
1764.29s - 1766.05s |  and we submitted it,
1766.05s - 1770.37s |  and the IETF just didn't want to touch this at all.
1770.37s - 1772.13s |  They were like, what are you doing?
1772.13s - 1776.21s |  This is too contentious,
1776.21s - 1779.33s |  and this is something that's business process oriented.
1779.33s - 1781.57s |  This isn't really a technical process,
1781.57s - 1782.97s |  and our argument was,
1782.97s - 1785.57s |  this is the safety of the Internet.
1785.57s - 1787.45s |  What is the IETF doing,
1787.45s - 1789.97s |  the Internet Engineering Task Force doing,
1789.97s - 1791.93s |  if they can't come up with a process
1791.93s - 1794.49s |  that will help with the safety of the Internet?
1794.49s - 1796.37s |  They just punted it.
1796.37s - 1797.97s |  They would not approve it,
1797.97s - 1799.85s |  and you can still go look it up.
1799.85s - 1802.97s |  It's out there, but it didn't get approved.
1802.97s - 1804.57s |  Because it didn't get approved,
1804.57s - 1805.81s |  it was like, hey,
1805.81s - 1807.45s |  maybe this isn't so good.
1807.45s - 1810.73s |  So we actually failed in this one.
1810.73s - 1813.25s |  If we had just published it on our own,
1813.25s - 1814.45s |  it might have been better.
1814.45s - 1816.69s |  But since it wasn't approved,
1816.69s - 1819.77s |  that was bad.
1819.77s - 1824.29s |  We called it a responsible vulnerability disclosure process,
1824.29s - 1826.57s |  which I think was a big mistake,
1826.57s - 1828.93s |  because then the researcher community was like,
1828.93s - 1830.77s |  responsible, isn't that the thing that
1830.77s - 1834.73s |  Microsoft wants finders to be responsible?
1834.73s - 1837.17s |  I don't like your policy either.
1837.17s - 1840.37s |  So that's why today,
1840.37s - 1842.97s |  we use the word coordinated instead of responsible,
1842.97s - 1845.73s |  and that's the legacy of that.
1845.73s - 1848.25s |  But something good came out of this,
1848.25s - 1849.89s |  and what came out of that was
1849.89s - 1852.09s |  the Organization for Internet Safety,
1852.13s - 1854.69s |  which only lasted for a couple of years.
1854.69s - 1857.09s |  This was something that where
1857.09s - 1860.41s |  Microsoft actually reached out to me,
1860.41s - 1863.53s |  and said, you came up with the IETF draft,
1863.53s - 1865.53s |  what if we come up with an organization,
1865.53s - 1869.29s |  and we get more security consulting companies,
1869.29s - 1870.53s |  and security product companies
1870.53s - 1872.49s |  teaming up with more vendors,
1872.49s - 1875.33s |  and we get behind what you did
1875.33s - 1879.29s |  in that responsible disclosure process.
1879.29s - 1882.81s |  So the Organization for Internet Safety was formed,
1882.81s - 1885.13s |  it was made of security companies like At Stake,
1885.13s - 1888.17s |  BindView, Foundstone, Gardened,
1888.17s - 1894.33s |  ISS, and then software companies like Caldera International,
1894.33s - 1896.33s |  which was a Linux distribution,
1896.33s - 1898.13s |  and a Unix distribution,
1898.13s - 1899.61s |  and Microsoft, Oracle,
1899.61s - 1902.65s |  SGI, Symantec, and Network Associates,
1902.65s - 1904.41s |  I guess are both kind of software companies
1904.41s - 1906.49s |  and security companies,
1906.65s - 1911.69s |  and we basically came up with a standard,
1911.69s - 1913.17s |  and we all agreed to use it.
1913.17s - 1915.89s |  So the companies that are listed there,
1915.89s - 1920.33s |  all agreed to use this vulnerability disclosure process.
1920.33s - 1922.77s |  So we had people discovering vulnerabilities,
1922.77s - 1926.13s |  and people who were fixing problems,
1926.13s - 1928.93s |  all using this one standard,
1928.93s - 1930.53s |  and this one kind of stuck,
1930.53s - 1932.01s |  because it just basically when
1932.01s - 1934.21s |  the ISO standard was finally developed,
1934.21s - 1935.73s |  which started in 2008,
1935.73s - 1937.17s |  and then Katie Masuris,
1937.17s - 1938.53s |  who was a former At Stake employee
1938.53s - 1940.49s |  who came over to Microsoft,
1940.49s - 1945.13s |  was the representative for Microsoft on that ISO standard,
1945.13s - 1946.61s |  and today we actually have
1946.61s - 1949.65s |  an ISO standard around vulnerability disclosure.
1949.65s - 1953.25s |  But you can see it took like a good 10 years to get there,
1953.25s - 1959.05s |  and there were some bumps and bruises along the way.
1959.05s - 1964.09s |  Now, I think that this process
1964.13s - 1966.57s |  of coming together around disclosure
1966.57s - 1968.41s |  was one of the most important processes
1968.41s - 1971.69s |  bringing hackers and vendors together,
1971.69s - 1973.69s |  so that we could really work together,
1973.69s - 1977.17s |  and hackers could be trusted by vendors.
1977.17s - 1981.25s |  And this led to the professionalization of hacking.
1982.17s - 1984.57s |  Those security boutiques,
1984.57s - 1986.41s |  At Stake, Garden, and Foundstone,
1986.41s - 1987.73s |  were basically full of people
1987.73s - 1989.29s |  from the vulnerability research community.
1989.29s - 1990.57s |  They were full of hackers.
1990.57s - 1992.37s |  If you know anyone who worked at those companies,
1992.37s - 1995.49s |  and maybe some in this room did work at those companies.
1996.57s - 2001.25s |  And it was an important part of legitimizing
2001.25s - 2004.57s |  what we were doing was to have this standard process
2004.57s - 2007.33s |  that everyone agreed on.
2007.33s - 2011.41s |  And this led to the professionalization of hacking.
2011.41s - 2013.89s |  It wasn't just an independent thing.
2013.89s - 2015.77s |  It wasn't an academic thing.
2015.77s - 2017.29s |  It wasn't a hobby.
2017.29s - 2018.77s |  It was a profession,
2018.77s - 2020.65s |  and you could actually earn money
2020.65s - 2023.65s |  doing the things that people used to do independently.
2023.65s - 2025.85s |  You could earn money doing vulnerability research.
2025.85s - 2029.61s |  You could earn money doing penetration testing.
2029.61s - 2032.29s |  And this journey is documented in this paper
2032.29s - 2035.89s |  by Matt Gorzen and Gabriela Coleman.
2035.89s - 2038.49s |  You might recognize Gabriela Coleman's name.
2038.49s - 2041.57s |  She wrote sort of the definitive book on anonymous,
2041.57s - 2043.41s |  came out in 2015.
2043.41s - 2045.73s |  She's an anthropologist.
2045.73s - 2047.49s |  She's a professor at Harvard.
2047.49s - 2050.89s |  And I was interviewed for this paper.
2050.89s - 2051.73s |  It's very good.
2051.73s - 2055.21s |  It talks a lot about this journey
2055.21s - 2059.01s |  that hackers took to become professionals.
2060.71s - 2064.13s |  Now, we had our own flavor of this at the Loft
2064.13s - 2066.89s |  where we said, hey, we can become professionals.
2066.89s - 2069.21s |  We can make this our day job.
2070.61s - 2072.69s |  And we did sell some software.
2072.69s - 2074.29s |  We sold Loft Crack.
2074.29s - 2079.29s |  We did do some penetration testing as consultants.
2080.45s - 2082.29s |  We did some work for the SEC.
2082.29s - 2085.53s |  We did some work for some consulting companies
2085.53s - 2087.27s |  trying to hack their networks.
2088.51s - 2091.37s |  But it just wasn't paying all the bills, right?
2091.37s - 2093.89s |  We couldn't all be full-time.
2094.99s - 2098.39s |  And we struggled with our business model.
2098.39s - 2101.17s |  Frankly, we were all techno nerds
2101.17s - 2103.45s |  that didn't have any business experience.
2104.17s - 2106.37s |  No one had founded a company before.
2108.13s - 2110.45s |  And we just didn't know how to build that sales
2110.45s - 2113.89s |  and marketing and go-to-market and a business structure
2113.89s - 2117.01s |  that could actually turn this into a business.
2117.01s - 2118.93s |  So what did we do?
2118.93s - 2121.13s |  Because we couldn't start a company ourselves,
2121.13s - 2123.21s |  we decided to join a company.
2123.21s - 2125.17s |  We decided to join with this company
2125.17s - 2128.07s |  that was still in stealth mode called At Stake,
2128.07s - 2132.41s |  which was some security consultants
2132.41s - 2134.85s |  had started this company.
2134.85s - 2135.97s |  It was kind of a spin-out
2135.97s - 2137.77s |  from Cambridge Technology Partners,
2137.77s - 2139.17s |  which was a big consulting company
2139.17s - 2142.29s |  that had a tiny, little security practice.
2142.29s - 2143.97s |  And we joined up.
2143.97s - 2146.85s |  And this, of course, was the big news
2146.85s - 2150.05s |  when we launched the company in January of 2000.
2150.05s - 2153.29s |  These guys from the Loft who testified at Congress
2153.29s - 2154.73s |  and used hacker names.
2154.73s - 2156.61s |  We were still using our hacker names at this time,
2156.61s - 2157.79s |  working at the company.
2158.79s - 2163.79s |  And so this is how the press took it, right?
2164.11s - 2166.15s |  We're using good hackers to battle bad hackers,
2166.15s - 2168.59s |  which isn't necessarily wrong, right?
2170.43s - 2172.43s |  I don't know if we were a scraggly band.
2173.67s - 2175.51s |  We did have long hair.
2175.51s - 2180.51s |  But this was one of the first sort of shots
2181.79s - 2186.43s |  across the bow of the professionalization of hackers.
2186.43s - 2187.83s |  And the hacker community,
2187.83s - 2189.83s |  there was a lot of people who didn't like this.
2189.83s - 2193.51s |  They didn't like that we were now available for hire
2193.51s - 2198.43s |  from the very companies that we were exposing weaknesses in.
2198.43s - 2200.47s |  We were called sellouts, right?
2200.47s - 2203.55s |  It was like when that small band
2203.55s - 2205.15s |  signs the big record deal, right?
2205.15s - 2206.03s |  You're a sellout now.
2206.03s - 2208.53s |  You're under the control of the big record label.
2208.53s - 2211.23s |  You can't do all the things you would have done before.
2211.23s - 2214.57s |  And to some degree, that's true, right?
2214.57s - 2218.93s |  And our dream was to do what we loved, right?
2218.93s - 2220.45s |  As a full-time job.
2220.45s - 2225.21s |  And I think we all know that that dream isn't perfect, right?
2225.21s - 2227.49s |  There are limitations and constraints
2227.49s - 2231.81s |  when you start doing things and charging people
2231.81s - 2233.81s |  a couple hundred dollars an hour, right?
2233.81s - 2236.41s |  To do something, they have certain expectations.
2238.73s - 2242.49s |  So we launched as a security consultancy
2242.49s - 2244.53s |  and a different kind of consultancy.
2244.53s - 2246.13s |  Up until this point in time,
2246.13s - 2248.63s |  if you were a security consultant,
2248.63s - 2250.59s |  like we'll say in 2000,
2251.49s - 2254.41s |  you probably worked at one of the big accounting firms
2254.41s - 2258.61s |  and you were doing checklists against compliance criteria,
2258.61s - 2259.43s |  right?
2259.43s - 2260.27s |  You weren't doing pen testing.
2260.27s - 2262.25s |  You weren't doing code reviews, right?
2262.25s - 2264.81s |  You weren't doing threat modeling.
2264.81s - 2266.87s |  Or you were a security consultant
2266.87s - 2269.15s |  that worked for a product company
2269.15s - 2273.79s |  and you figured out how to sell more of your yellow boxes
2273.79s - 2275.79s |  and configure those yellow boxes, right?
2275.79s - 2278.21s |  We all know that there are security people
2278.21s - 2279.91s |  that work at product companies.
2279.91s - 2281.31s |  This was something different.
2281.31s - 2285.19s |  We didn't sell accounting or compliance.
2285.19s - 2287.43s |  We didn't sell products.
2287.43s - 2290.95s |  We were going to look at your network or your products
2290.95s - 2295.47s |  the way an attacker would and tell you how to fix that.
2295.47s - 2297.39s |  And so we did our own vulnerability research
2297.39s - 2298.47s |  so we could keep publishing
2298.47s - 2299.95s |  and figure out new vulnerabilities
2299.95s - 2304.75s |  and new types of technology that was coming along.
2304.75s - 2306.69s |  So we knew how to test it.
2306.69s - 2310.59s |  Things like appliances, things like Wi-Fi.
2310.59s - 2312.31s |  All this is pre-cloud.
2312.31s - 2314.19s |  So obviously when cloud came across,
2314.19s - 2316.31s |  we had a lot of things to look at.
2316.31s - 2318.47s |  We built our own attack and testing tools
2318.47s - 2320.95s |  so we had capabilities that no one had.
2320.95s - 2323.07s |  And of course, we secured applications
2323.07s - 2324.67s |  by breaking into them.
2324.67s - 2329.67s |  And then Guardant and Foundstone soon followed us
2330.91s - 2332.31s |  doing something very similar,
2332.31s - 2337.11s |  hiring the same exact kind of vulnerability research people.
2338.63s - 2340.77s |  And then in 2002, Bill Gates penned
2340.77s - 2342.53s |  the Trusted Computing Memo.
2343.65s - 2347.41s |  And the worms kept coming.
2348.39s - 2350.39s |  The vulnerabilities didn't get fixed fast enough.
2350.39s - 2353.67s |  There were too many vulnerabilities to fix fast enough.
2353.67s - 2356.43s |  Something had to drastically change.
2356.43s - 2358.91s |  And Microsoft was really the first company
2358.91s - 2361.87s |  that said we need to do a drastic change.
2361.87s - 2364.05s |  We need to stop everyone from coding.
2364.99s - 2367.45s |  Everyone's gotta read Writing Secure Code
2367.45s - 2370.75s |  by David LeBlanc and Michael Howard,
2370.75s - 2373.35s |  which I think was published the year before this.
2373.35s - 2377.47s |  And then they're gonna write secure code.
2379.45s - 2382.15s |  Well, it's definitely not that simple
2382.15s - 2383.59s |  because we still have these problems today.
2383.59s - 2385.63s |  You can't just read a book on secure code
2385.63s - 2387.39s |  and know how to do this.
2387.39s - 2389.87s |  And you needed more than to just know
2389.87s - 2392.23s |  what code not to write, right?
2393.65s - 2396.99s |  That's good to know, but really you need a process, right?
2396.99s - 2399.55s |  You need a process to secure the application
2399.55s - 2401.35s |  as it's being built, right?
2401.35s - 2403.07s |  That's what you needed.
2403.07s - 2408.07s |  And I think soon after stopping all the development,
2408.31s - 2409.39s |  having everyone read the book,
2409.39s - 2411.59s |  they realized that this wasn't enough.
2411.59s - 2414.99s |  They needed outside help like Tom was saying.
2414.99s - 2417.11s |  They needed people who had figured out
2417.11s - 2421.59s |  how to make a process around building secure software.
2421.59s - 2424.19s |  And they needed people from these consultancies
2424.19s - 2428.27s |  to come in and work alongside the developers
2428.27s - 2431.71s |  and teach the developers how to do this by doing it.
2431.71s - 2434.95s |  And also securing the product at the same time, right?
2434.95s - 2437.15s |  Securing the product is actually the most important part.
2437.15s - 2438.91s |  And then of course people would learn
2438.91s - 2441.01s |  by doing along the way.
2441.83s - 2444.03s |  A funny kind of story is Foundstone
2444.03s - 2448.15s |  actually got in first before At Stake.
2448.15s - 2449.71s |  Foundstone was here.
2449.71s - 2454.13s |  They were helping Microsoft, but they got fired.
2455.85s - 2457.59s |  And they got fired because they wouldn't stop
2457.59s - 2459.97s |  wearing their Foundstone polo shirts
2459.97s - 2461.99s |  that said Foundstone across them,
2461.99s - 2463.59s |  which just made it very clear
2463.59s - 2465.15s |  that there was all these Foundstone people
2465.15s - 2466.95s |  securing the software.
2466.95s - 2469.59s |  And Microsoft wanted a more collaborative look.
2469.59s - 2470.43s |  They didn't want it.
2470.43s - 2472.91s |  Foundstone is coming and doing this.
2472.91s - 2477.03s |  And luckily for At Stake, Foundstone got fired
2477.03s - 2479.47s |  and they said we need one of these other boutiques
2479.47s - 2480.55s |  to come in.
2480.55s - 2485.15s |  And At Stake then got the deal to help secure IIS6,
2485.15s - 2487.17s |  which was really the first product
2487.17s - 2489.13s |  that went through this process.
2489.13s - 2490.87s |  It was completely rebuilt from scratch.
2490.87s - 2492.95s |  Complete new code base.
2496.17s - 2499.43s |  Andrew Cushman was the general manager
2499.43s - 2501.63s |  on that product, and I think he later
2501.63s - 2505.39s |  worked at the MSRC after that.
2505.39s - 2508.71s |  And so we pulled up our best team
2510.71s - 2514.59s |  to come here and help assess IIS6.
2514.59s - 2516.87s |  It was myself and Christian Ryu,
2516.87s - 2520.43s |  who was Dildog, wrote back Orifice, also from The Loft.
2520.43s - 2523.51s |  He's also the co-founder of Veracode with me.
2523.51s - 2525.55s |  Windows Snyder and Frank Swiderski,
2525.55s - 2528.19s |  who would later be hired by Microsoft
2528.19s - 2529.75s |  after this engagement.
2529.75s - 2532.07s |  And they wrote the book Threat Modeling,
2532.07s - 2533.87s |  Microsoft Threat Modeling book,
2533.87s - 2536.27s |  based on the work that we had done.
2536.27s - 2538.27s |  We had refined a lot of the processes
2538.27s - 2539.83s |  during this engagement.
2539.83s - 2544.83s |  And Dave Eitel, which he founded Immunity
2545.15s - 2546.51s |  after leaving At Stake.
2547.81s - 2551.55s |  And so these are some of the things that we did
2551.55s - 2553.15s |  that were process-oriented.
2554.55s - 2556.79s |  I think the threat modeling was a huge one,
2556.79s - 2559.83s |  showing how to do data flow diagrams
2559.83s - 2563.43s |  and threat modeling with the architects
2563.43s - 2565.37s |  and the designers of the software.
2566.55s - 2568.07s |  We had a learning lunch,
2568.07s - 2571.15s |  showed how to exploit heap overflows,
2571.15s - 2572.67s |  because people just didn't really understand
2572.67s - 2574.11s |  how that was possible.
2574.11s - 2577.59s |  And I think that helps developers see
2577.59s - 2580.35s |  that these mistakes actually lead to this.
2580.35s - 2582.07s |  Another really important thing is I think
2582.07s - 2584.83s |  this is the first project where software was fuzzed.
2585.79s - 2589.11s |  At the time, Dave Eitel was writing Spike,
2589.11s - 2594.11s |  which was the first open-source available fuzzer.
2594.27s - 2596.27s |  I'm sure the NSA had something like this.
2596.27s - 2598.91s |  And fault injection was something that QA people
2598.91s - 2600.39s |  had been doing for a lot,
2600.39s - 2603.41s |  but a fuzzer tries to do things specifically
2603.41s - 2605.01s |  that are gonna cause security problems,
2605.01s - 2609.59s |  like long strings and delimiters and things like this,
2609.59s - 2611.57s |  which are gonna cause problems.
2611.57s - 2612.69s |  Dave put that together,
2612.69s - 2616.05s |  and we found bugs in ISS6 with the fuzzer,
2616.05s - 2618.33s |  so that was the first time that was used.
2618.33s - 2620.53s |  I was using the sysinternals process explorer
2620.53s - 2623.27s |  to show how you could find runtime attack surface
2623.27s - 2625.37s |  that sometimes the developers didn't even know about,
2625.37s - 2627.13s |  because they were just linking in a library.
2627.13s - 2628.91s |  It was running in their process,
2628.91s - 2630.51s |  and it was opening a named pipe,
2630.51s - 2632.25s |  and they didn't even know that that named pipe
2632.25s - 2634.07s |  then needed to be secured.
2634.07s - 2636.93s |  So understanding, from a hacker's viewpoint,
2636.93s - 2638.73s |  you look at the runtime environment.
2638.73s - 2641.23s |  You don't just think about the code or the design.
2642.09s - 2644.05s |  You find things like that.
2644.05s - 2647.25s |  And maybe we helped with Mark Russinovich's company
2647.25s - 2649.13s |  actually getting bought by Microsoft later,
2649.13s - 2651.53s |  because they liked the tool so much.
2651.53s - 2654.95s |  But we really helped come up with that SDLC,
2654.95s - 2658.25s |  which was later codified in a book
2659.25s - 2662.91s |  by, I think, Steve Lipner and others
2662.91s - 2666.01s |  around how do you secure software
2666.01s - 2667.01s |  while you're developing it.
2667.01s - 2670.73s |  So I feel like we definitely contributed to that.
2670.73s - 2672.73s |  And I think Michael Howard gave us a credit
2672.73s - 2676.45s |  in Secure Coding 2 around the threat modeling process
2676.45s - 2677.61s |  that he talked about in the book.
2677.61s - 2679.91s |  He said he learned some stuff from Matt Stake.
2682.45s - 2686.53s |  And so I think around 2003, after this happened
2686.53s - 2688.99s |  and disease engagements happened,
2688.99s - 2691.65s |  we did other products too after that.
2691.65s - 2693.25s |  So we must have done a good job.
2694.45s - 2697.57s |  It really kind of changed the landscape at Microsoft.
2698.61s - 2700.53s |  Security testing became a requirement
2701.29s - 2702.13s |  as part of building.
2703.21s - 2707.05s |  Companies started to have product security response teams.
2707.05s - 2709.13s |  People started to look at the book,
2709.13s - 2712.65s |  the Microsoft SDLC book, as a model.
2712.65s - 2715.25s |  Later became an ISO standard.
2715.25s - 2720.25s |  And then bug bounties started to crop up.
2720.97s - 2723.93s |  It's a little known fact that Firefox or Mozilla
2723.93s - 2727.57s |  had the very first bug bounty back in 1995.
2727.57s - 2729.61s |  But they were like the only one
2729.61s - 2731.97s |  until like the early 2000s
2731.97s - 2734.33s |  when other commercial companies got on board
2734.33s - 2739.33s |  with bug bounties, which I think was also a huge step.
2741.17s - 2743.97s |  So I just want to close out here
2743.97s - 2746.13s |  with how are we learning to secure products
2746.13s - 2747.81s |  from hackers today?
2747.81s - 2751.35s |  And this is just like how we do it today, right?
2751.35s - 2752.85s |  We learn from hackers
2752.85s - 2755.81s |  through our vulnerability disclosure programs, right?
2755.81s - 2758.25s |  They send us information about a bug
2758.25s - 2759.97s |  and we learn how they found that bug
2759.97s - 2762.57s |  if we asked how they found the problem.
2763.65s - 2766.05s |  We learn from academics, right?
2766.05s - 2767.53s |  It used to be people like Hobbit
2767.53s - 2772.45s |  writing papers about securing an internet protocol.
2772.45s - 2775.21s |  Now the academic community is doing this.
2775.21s - 2779.33s |  We see a lot of papers around how to secure LLMs, right?
2779.33s - 2780.81s |  And transformers now.
2780.81s - 2784.25s |  And how to trick machine learning and things like that.
2784.25s - 2787.43s |  There's a very active publishing around these problems.
2787.43s - 2789.05s |  But academics weren't doing it back then,
2789.05s - 2792.23s |  but they are doing it now, which is great.
2792.23s - 2794.81s |  And there's a bazillion conferences now, right?
2794.81s - 2797.57s |  It isn't just DEF CON and Black Hat, right?
2797.57s - 2798.95s |  There's Blue Hat, right?
2798.95s - 2801.93s |  Where we can all come together and work together.
2801.93s - 2806.93s |  So the world has really changed from what it was before.
2808.53s - 2810.17s |  And I just wanted to let everyone know
2810.17s - 2812.13s |  how did we get here, right?
2812.13s - 2814.93s |  Before people start to forget the history
2814.93s - 2817.17s |  and some of us who were at the first Blue Hat
2817.91s - 2818.75s |  aren't here anymore.
2819.91s - 2821.75s |  So thank you for listening to me
2821.75s - 2823.59s |  and I hope you have a great Blue Hat.
