**Event Overview**
- **Title**: BlueHat 2024: S12: Sweet QuaDreams or Nightmare Before Christmas? Dissecting an iOS 0-day
- **Presenter**: Christine Fossaceca from Microsoft
- **Co-Author**: Bill Marczak from Citizen Lab

**Private Sector Offensive Actors (PSOAs)**
- **Definition**: Companies developing surveillance and intrusion capabilities sold to governments
- **Use Cases**: Tracking criminals and terrorists or spying on journalists and dissidents
- **Key Player**: NSO Group and their "Pegasus" spyware

**QuaDream Spyware**
- **Discovery**: Microsoft and Citizen Lab obtained and analyzed QuaDream's spyware
- **Target**: Journalists, political opposition figures, and NGO workers
- **Named by Microsoft**: "KingsPawn"
- **Exploit Named by CitizenLab**: "ENDOFDAYS"

**Zero-Click Exploits**
- **Definition**: Exploits that do not require user interaction
- **Examples**:
  - **Forced Entry**: Delivered via iMessage, exploiting a core graphics library vulnerability
  - **Blast Pass**: Buffer overflow in image IO
  - **Triangulation**: Issue in the font parser

**Threat Detection and Analysis**
- **Approaches**:
  - **Top-Down**: Start with the sample, look for forensic traces
  - **Bottom-Up**: Start with the victim device, look for implausible artifacts
- **Key Indicators**:
  - Non-iOS update binaries running from certain directories
  - Evidence of activity in the ephemeral temp directory

**Collaboration and Attribution**
- **Microsoft and Citizen Lab Collaboration**: Sharing of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- **Threat Actor**: Carmine Tsunami, a PSOA identified as Quadream

**iOS Malware Capabilities**
- **Bypassing Protections**: ASLR, sandboxing, code signing, etc.
- **Data Exfiltration**: Device info, audio, pictures, location
- **Additional Actions**: Exfiltrating and deleting keychain items, subverting iCloud two-factor authentication

**iCalendar Exploit Theory**
- **Delivery Method**: Malicious calendar invites exploiting XML parsing
- **Artifact Discovery**: Backdated calendar events used to avoid notifications
- **Exploit Execution**: C data tag manipulation in XML to inject malicious code

**Conclusion and Impact**
- **Collaboration Importance**: Essential for uncovering and mitigating threats
- **Cloud Services**: New vector for exploits
- **Mitigation**: Apple's lockdown mode to close off cloud connectivity 
- **Outcome**: Quadream filed for bankruptcy due to exposure and mitigation efforts
