**Event Overview**
- BlueHat 2024 session titled "Creating a Developer-Friendly Security Tool"
- Presented by Susan Krkasharian from Microsoft
- Focus on journey developing **AntiSSRF**, a secure software library

**SSRF Vulnerabilities**
- Occur when attackers make unauthorized requests via a server
- Can expose sensitive data and internal services
- Significant threat in cloud environments like Azure
- Part of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Potential impacts include token exfiltration, internal service enumeration, and firewall bypassing

**Approach to Tackling SSRF**
- Multi-pronged strategy: **Protect, Detect, and Respond**
- **Protect**: Development of **AntiSSRF** and SEO guidance
- **Detect**: Use of dynamic and static analysis including internal platform Dusseldorf and CodeQL queries
- **Respond**: Support for engineers dealing with SSRF, identifying antipatterns

**Development of AntiSSRF**
- Initiated following the discovery of an SSRF vulnerability
- Aim for a standard solution to avoid reinventing the wheel
- First version named URI Validator
- Developers incorporate the library easily, ensuring consistent protection

**Challenges and Solutions**
- Shift in perspective for new security engineers to understand developer needs
- Naming methods and refining design for usability
- Encountered software development challenges and compliance requirements
- Developed secure DevOps pipelines and automated regression tests

**Adoption and Engagement**
- Building trust with developers for integration into existing code
- Support from experienced engineers aided adoption
- Partnerships with MSRC and CodeQL teams to drive adoption
- Creation of comprehensive SDL guidance and language-specific instructions

**Learnings and Future Steps**
- Importance of clear communication and documentation for developer onboarding
- Plans to open-source **AntiSSRF** and expand to other languages and frameworks
- Successful reduction in remediation time by 50% at Microsoft
- **AntiSSRF** now protects numerous critical Azure services
