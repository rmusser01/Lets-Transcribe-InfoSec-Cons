**Introduction to SLIP**

- **SLIP**: A **security solution** developed to protect AI models from theft
- Focus on **protecting intellectual property (IP)** of model owners
- Addresses risks associated with deploying AI models on **edge devices**

**Challenges in Protecting AI Models**

- **Value of LLMs**: High cost of creation and deployment, involving computing resources and proprietary data
- **Risks on Edge Devices**: Vulnerable to attacks, exposing models to theft
- **Current Methods**: Limitations in practicality, accuracy, and security

**SLIP Framework**

- **Hybrid Inference Algorithm**: Protects models without accuracy degradation
- **Model Partitioning**: Divides models between secure and vulnerable resources
- **Matrix Decomposition**: Ensures sensitive IP is retained on secure resources
- **Security Guarantees**: Prevents attackers from inferring secured information

**Components of SLIP**

- **Model-Weight Decomposition**: Splits model into two entities
- **Secure Inference Protocol**: Facilitates protected communication between entities

**Implementation and Results**

- **Experimental Results**: Demonstrated robustness and effectiveness
- **Applications**: Successfully implemented in models like **GPT-2**, **YOLO-X**, and **Microsoft's V3**

**Future Directions**

- Enhance **training data protection**, **privacy**, and **obfuscation** techniques
- Improve **deployment aspects**: latency, memory efficiency, and bit depth

**Conclusion**

- SLIP provides a **compelling solution** for protecting LLMs on edge devices
- Maintains model integrity and offers a high level of security for valuable IP
