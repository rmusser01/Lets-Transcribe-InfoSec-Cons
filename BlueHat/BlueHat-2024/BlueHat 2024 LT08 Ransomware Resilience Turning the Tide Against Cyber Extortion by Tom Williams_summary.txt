**Introduction to Ransomware Resilience**
- **Ransomware attacks** are a significant threat to global organizations, causing substantial financial losses.
- The **impact** of ransomware is challenging to quantify due to fragmented data and lack of centralized oversight.
- A **multidisciplinary perspective** is needed to analyze cybersecurity risks and ransomware threats across industries.

**Speaker Background**
- Dr. Tom Williams is a seasoned **security practitioner** with nearly 18 years of experience.
- He has a background in offensive and defensive cyber operations and has published research internationally.

**Research on Ransomware**
- Started research in 2020 to understand **ransomware trends** across industries.
- Faced challenges due to lack of disclosed and fragmented **data**.
- Built a data set using the **SEC's EDGAR system** to analyze publicly traded company information.
- **Data collection phase** involved querying and processing data with machine learning and natural language processing.

**Insights from the Data Set**
- Analyzed data from 2,928 companies across 146 industries.
- Found **increasing risk** from 2020 to 2022, particularly in healthcare, banks, and technology sectors.
- **Legislation** now requires companies associated with critical infrastructure to disclose cybersecurity incidents.

**Historical Context of Ransomware**
- Ransomware has been around for over 30 years but has **evolved significantly**.
- Modern ransomware techniques began around 2013 and accelerated by 2016.
- The first known case of ransomware affecting **critical infrastructure** occurred in 2021.

**Current State of Ransomware**
- Ransomware is now a **global challenge**.
- Threat actors use **cyber-defined data centers** to encrypt entire systems and extort money.
- The **absence of boundaries** in cyberspace makes ransomware highly lucrative.

**Role of Artificial Intelligence**
- AI is aiding in the **skill gaps** of threat actors.
- It allows for **accelerated threat vector discovery** and evasion of detection during encryption processes.

**Mitigation Strategies**
- To combat ransomware, **cyber resilience** is crucial.
- Organizations should invest in **modernizing infrastructure** and implementing advanced protection strategies like micro-segmentation and zero-trust architecture.
- **Proactive measures** and knowledge sharing are essential to address the lack of information and understanding.

**Conclusion**
- The talk emphasizes the importance of accepting the inevitability of cyber attacks and preparing for them.
- Encourages **business continuity** and resilience plans to adapt and recover from attacks.
- Ends with a call to action for security practitioners to **share knowledge** and help organizations in need.
