**Entitlements on macOS**

- **Definition**: Entitlements are a form of permissions on macOS, different from traditional operating systems.
- **Importance**: Critical for developers to understand to prevent vulnerabilities.
- **Example**: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft apps for macOS can lead to stealing permissions.

**Talos Vulnerability Discovery Team**

- **Role**: Find new vulnerabilities in products to protect customers.
- **Achievements**: Written about 2,000 advisories covering 2,700 CVEs since 2016.

**Discretionary Access Control**

- **Functionality**: Users control access to their resources.
- **Limitations**: Malware running as a user can access all that user's files and resources.

**Transparency Consent and Control (TCC)**

- **Implementation**: Requires explicit user consent to access sensitive resources.
- **Resources**: Includes pictures, documents, contacts, microphone, and camera.
- **Mechanism**: Works with entitlements, declared at the time of compilation and requested at runtime.

**Bypassing TCC Limitations**

- **Methods**: Regular memory corruption vulnerabilities, executing another application, or library injection.
- **Advanced Capabilities**: Some applications can have more permissions than typical, blurring lines between user and privileged user.

**Application Types on macOS**

1. **App Store Apps**: Run in sandbox, entitlements declared, user prompted on first use.
2. **Notarized Apps**: Not from App Store but scanned by Apple. Must declare entitlements and enable hardened runtime.
3. **Non-Notarized Apps**: Hard to run, require explicit permission in Security section.

**Hardened Runtime**

- **Purpose**: Prevents code injection, library injection, and process memory manipulation.
- **Disable Library Validation**: Allows unsigned libraries; useful for plugins but exploitable by attackers.

**Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Applications**

- **Discovery**: Eight vulnerabilities found in Microsoft Office apps on macOS.
- **Exploit**: Enabled injection of libraries to steal permissions.
- **Resolution**: Microsoft fixed some issues but forgot others; Quark's lab found another vulnerability later.

**Security Implications**

- **Importance of Enhanced Permissions**: Understanding enhanced permissions is crucial to maintaining security.
- **Consequences of Misuse**: Not using built-in protections undermines system permissions.

**Conclusion**

- **Understanding Permissions**: Essential for operating system security.
- **Protection Measures**: Must use protection mechanisms in place to safeguard user data.
