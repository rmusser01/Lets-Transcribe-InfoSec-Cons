  "description": "BlueHat 2024: LT01: World of Scams - A systematic analysis of online scams using the Scam Tactics and Techniques Framework Presented by Amit Tambe from F-Secure\n\nAbstract: Online scams are a multi-billion-dollar industry that targets consumers on the Internet. According to Global Anti-Scam Alliance, over $1 trillion is lost to scams worldwide.\n\nProblem - The threat landscape news is fraught with online scammers targeting consumers every day with ingenuity. While several cybersecurity players have attempted to analyze the scam landscape, these efforts are at best, ad-hoc. There is no single systematic approach that can describe to the reader, in detail, all the techniques and methods used by scammers. Whereas a scam taxonomy exists, it serves to provide examples of rather than defining systematically the tactics and techniques (T&T) adopted by scammers. Defining such a systematic framework can go a long way in enabling defenders to protect consumers against scams.\n\nOur paper showcases two unique contributions:\n\u2013 Scam kill chain \u2013 sequence of events involved in a scam attack on a consumer\n\u2013 Scam T&T framework - covers a comprehensive set of tactics and techniques used by scammers in the wild. The framework has been created based on our wide experience in the security field, including scams. Inspired from the MITRE\u00ae ATT&CK Matrix, our framework gives a thorough overview of steps taken by scammers to achieve their goals. A top-level tactic maps to a more detailed technique in the scam kill chain to characterize a mini-goal achieved by the scammer. Techniques represent the methods used by a scammer to achieve that specific mini-goal (i.e. tactic). This framework consists of 8 tactics and a total of 31 techniques.\n\nIn the presentation, we will see how the kill chain and \u201cscam tactics and techniques framework\u201d can be applied to conveniently visualize the progress of any scam, starting from how a user is targeted and ending with how money is cheated out of victims. Additionally, we will also see how the framework can be utilized by organizations to assess and thus improve their security posture against scams.",

 Hello, and welcome, everyone.
2.83s - 8.43s |  My name is Amit Tambe, and I work as a researcher at F-Secure Corporation in Finland.
8.43s - 13.31s |  And my topic for today is the F-Secure Scam Tactics and Techniques Framework.
13.31s - 18.31s |  But before I explain more about the framework, let me take a step back and explain about
18.31s - 22.91s |  the research goals and the motivation behind this work.
22.91s - 28.91s |  So scams are the number one threat that affects online consumers these days, and very little
28.91s - 36.07s |  work is being done to actually systematically analyze and understand scams.
36.07s - 40.79s |  Being in the security industry, we keep hearing about scams, scams affecting different people,
40.79s - 46.19s |  scams affecting different people in specific geographical locations, or scams that use
46.19s - 47.91s |  particular techniques.
47.91s - 51.99s |  But how many amongst us can remember all the scams that are out there?
51.99s - 55.75s |  So as security researchers, can we possibly remember everything?
55.75s - 60.75s |  That is challenging, because there is the fake pizza flyer scam, and a fake payment
60.75s - 66.79s |  scam, or a fake number scam, fake blackmail scam, fake profile scam, recovery scam, this
66.79s - 69.11s |  scam, that scam, so many scams.
69.11s - 74.03s |  In fact, it's impossible for me to even list all of those in a single slide here.
74.03s - 77.75s |  All I managed to do was get a small snapshot here.
77.75s - 84.27s |  But the essence is that it's really challenging to remember all the scams that are happening.
84.27s - 89.43s |  Even if your memory is good, is it possible to remember the techniques that all these
89.43s - 90.87s |  scams use?
90.87s - 96.55s |  That is equally difficult, because as a security researcher, say, you get exposed to a specific
96.55s - 97.55s |  subset of scams.
97.55s - 102.51s |  You will still only know the techniques that are being used in that particular subset.
102.51s - 107.43s |  You cannot possibly know all the techniques that are being used out there.
107.43s - 112.81s |  And after knowing about the scams and techniques, the third question is, how do you effectively
112.81s - 117.05s |  communicate this to the security industry at large?
117.05s - 122.33s |  So you may know some telltale signs, give some anecdotal evidence to your family, coworkers,
122.33s - 127.77s |  relatives, but how do you formally and systematically communicate this knowledge to everyone in
127.77s - 131.07s |  the security industry?
131.07s - 136.79s |  So in order to systematically understand scams, let's understand more about the scam kill
136.79s - 137.99s |  chain.
137.99s - 138.99s |  So what is a kill chain?
138.99s - 144.55s |  A scam kill chain is a set of steps that an attacker may take in order to make an attack
144.55s - 146.79s |  successful on an organization.
146.79s - 150.87s |  It's basically a term from the military and has been used in the security industry for
150.87s - 152.55s |  quite some time.
152.55s - 155.55s |  So now we extend the kill chain to scams as well.
155.55s - 157.35s |  So what is a scam kill chain?
157.35s - 162.05s |  Scam kill chain is a series of steps that a scammer has to undertake in order to make
162.05s - 164.99s |  the scam successful.
164.99s - 167.19s |  It always starts with reconnaissance.
167.19s - 172.15s |  Reconnaissance is where a scammer will identify potential victims and then try and get more
172.15s - 174.91s |  information about those potential victims.
174.91s - 178.83s |  So this information could be obtained either interactively, for example, your fake tech
178.83s - 184.11s |  support scam, the scammer may just call a potential victim, get more information.
184.11s - 189.31s |  It may also happen non-interactively, like manual scraping of your online profiles, your
189.31s - 192.71s |  social media profiles.
192.71s - 196.95s |  Once reconnaissance is done, the scammer will next move on to resource development.
197.71s - 202.31s |  So this is the phase where the scammer will build resources.
202.31s - 209.67s |  So resources may either be built from scratch, they may be purchased, they may be rented,
209.67s - 211.39s |  or downright stolen.
211.39s - 219.11s |  So your example resources would be purchasing domains, creating websites from scratch, maybe
219.11s - 222.35s |  creating online social media profiles.
222.35s - 225.83s |  But the most important thing that happens under resource development is the creation
225.83s - 226.99s |  of the bait.
226.99s - 232.15s |  So the bait is the lure that will be used by scammers to make the scam successful.
232.15s - 238.47s |  So whenever you get a fake tech support scam call, the scammer on the other side is talking
238.47s - 239.47s |  something.
239.47s - 243.67s |  So he needs a script to make that scam successful.
243.67s - 249.51s |  So the resource development phase is where such scripts will be written, or it may also
249.51s - 254.15s |  be the phase where those fake advertisements are created that you will later on see on
254.27s - 257.69s |  your social media account.
257.69s - 261.97s |  Once that is done, the scam actually commences, and the scammer makes initial contact with
261.97s - 263.21s |  the victim.
263.21s - 267.81s |  So this initial contact may be performed in two ways.
267.81s - 274.77s |  One is adversary-driven, which seems natural, but the other way is also victim-initiated.
274.77s - 279.25s |  So that may come as a surprise, because why would a victim initiate contact with a scammer?
279.25s - 286.21s |  But imagine making internet searches like fake Microsoft Windows software, or a pirated
286.21s - 288.25s |  copy of the latest released movie.
288.25s - 294.49s |  So such searches are quite likely to land you on websites that target the attention
294.49s - 297.89s |  of scammers.
297.89s - 306.21s |  So by now, the scammer is well invested in the scam, money-wise, time-wise, resource-wise.
306.21s - 308.89s |  Initial contact has been already made with the victim.
308.89s - 315.09s |  So now is the phase where the scammer needs to persist, basically make sure that the victim
315.09s - 318.17s |  is not driven away.
318.17s - 323.21s |  In case the victim becomes suspicious, the victim may just go away, and all the efforts
323.21s - 325.13s |  of the scammer may be wasted.
325.13s - 329.45s |  So this is the phase where the scammer will show multiple faces.
329.45s - 334.65s |  The scammer may do psychological manipulation, emotional manipulation, like in the case of
334.65s - 342.09s |  romance scams, or in some cases even make small fake payments to victims to make them
342.09s - 344.01s |  believe that the scam is real.
344.01s - 349.75s |  Basically do anything to keep the victim inside the scam.
349.75s - 355.23s |  Once that is achieved, the scammer would be able to access the victim's information.
355.23s - 360.35s |  This would be maybe your credit card details, credential access, your personal data that
360.35s - 362.21s |  could be sold off later.
362.21s - 365.43s |  But merely accessing such data is not enough.
365.43s - 372.87s |  The data also needs to be exfiltrated to an environment that is under the scammer's control.
372.87s - 376.99s |  This is because the access may be revoked or denied at any point in time.
376.99s - 382.15s |  So the scammer exfiltrates this information, either via your traditional C2 channels or
382.15s - 387.23s |  telegram channels in scams.
387.23s - 394.85s |  After the first victim has been exploited, the scammer certainly wants to get more returns
394.85s - 398.33s |  on the investments that they have done so far in the scam.
398.33s - 404.05s |  So the scammer tries to move laterally, which means they try to get as many more victims
404.05s - 405.49s |  as possible.
405.49s - 411.13s |  So for example, your Facebook credentials may be tried for your Instagram account, just
411.13s - 416.49s |  to see if they work for your Instagram account and get more contacts.
416.49s - 424.83s |  Or if your phone gets hacked, phishing SMS messages may be sent to your phone contacts.
424.83s - 426.63s |  And the last step is monetization.
426.63s - 428.79s |  So this is where the scammer makes money.
428.79s - 432.23s |  That's why the scammer is in the business of scams.
432.23s - 438.11s |  The currency of the scammer, however, may be multifold, like cryptocurrency, or perhaps
438.11s - 447.03s |  stealing your identity to buy a house later on, or simply using your identity to enjoy
447.03s - 450.83s |  premium services like YouTube Premium or Steam accounts, whatever.
451.31s - 456.51s |  These are the steps that a scammer needs to undertake to make a scam successful.
456.51s - 459.07s |  And now I come to the scam tactics and techniques framework.
459.07s - 465.19s |  So based on the skill chain, we have come up with a framework to formally and systematically
465.19s - 467.53s |  define scams.
467.53s - 470.35s |  This is based on two foundation principles.
470.35s - 475.39s |  One is our extensive review of real-world scams that are happening out there.
475.39s - 480.87s |  And the other is F-Secure's own extensive security industry experience over the last
480.87s - 481.87s |  three decades.
481.87s - 486.27s |  So I now introduce to you the scam tactics and techniques framework.
486.27s - 489.51s |  This is inspired from the MITRE ATT&CK matrix.
489.51s - 497.47s |  However, the ATT&CK matrix is applicable for enterprise context, whereas the scam framework
497.47s - 500.47s |  is applicable in case of consumer scams.
500.47s - 504.71s |  So the table is made up of several tactics that are the columns.
505.03s - 508.55s |  These correspond to the scam kill chain steps that I explained earlier.
508.55s - 511.03s |  And techniques are the rows in the table.
511.03s - 516.31s |  So these are more detailed steps that a scammer needs to undertake in order to make that particular
516.31s - 518.11s |  tactic successful.
518.11s - 522.91s |  So for example, if you take initial contact, initial contact with the victim may be established
522.91s - 523.91s |  in several ways.
523.91s - 525.55s |  So several techniques may be used.
525.55s - 530.67s |  For example, sending a phishing email, or making fake phone calls, or simply sending
530.67s - 533.15s |  phishing SMS.
533.15s - 538.63s |  I would also like to attract your attention to the arrow at the bottom with green color
538.63s - 539.87s |  towards the left side.
539.87s - 544.27s |  What it means is the earlier you are able to detect a scam as per this framework, the
544.27s - 545.75s |  better protection you can provide.
545.75s - 549.59s |  So more towards the left would mean better.
549.59s - 555.81s |  You would be able to stop the scam attack earlier.
555.81s - 563.77s |  I would now like to walk you through a real-life scam example and show how it maps to our framework.
563.77s - 566.33s |  So I've chosen the example of a recovery scam.
566.33s - 574.65s |  Recovery scam is where you select people who have been already victims of a crypto investment
574.65s - 576.93s |  scam.
576.93s - 582.41s |  So these victims may go to their social media accounts to file their grievances, share their
582.41s - 583.41s |  feelings.
583.41s - 588.13s |  And that's where the scammer swoops right in and tries to make fake promises to such
588.13s - 593.09s |  victims like, hey, if you pay me a specific amount of cryptocurrency fee, I can help you
593.41s - 595.57s |  recover your lost cryptocurrency.
595.57s - 597.45s |  So that's a recovery scam.
597.45s - 601.50s |  And how would that map to our framework?
601.50s - 607.14s |  So a recovery scammer would, again, begin with reconnaissance and do a manual profiling
607.14s - 609.32s |  to identify potential victims.
609.32s - 615.34s |  So in our example, the scammer would go to online social media accounts and identify
615.34s - 618.54s |  potential victims.
618.54s - 622.98s |  Once that is done, the heavy building of resource development starts.
622.98s - 628.90s |  The scammer will likely need new domains, a new phishing website, possibly even a chat
628.90s - 635.34s |  bot on that phishing website to answer victims' questions in an automated fashion.
635.34s - 639.90s |  The scammer certainly needs fake social media accounts to make the victim believe that the
639.90s - 645.66s |  scam is real and also develop a human language script that will be used when interacting
645.66s - 652.78s |  with victims, the potential victims that have been identified.
652.78s - 659.90s |  After this is done, the scammer will establish initial contact with the victims.
659.90s - 663.48s |  In our example, this contact will be adversary driven.
663.48s - 669.22s |  So the scammer is the one who takes the initial step.
669.22s - 675.14s |  After the first responses have been received from these potential victims, the scammer
675.14s - 680.70s |  wants to make sure that the recovery scam continues and the victim is not driven away.
680.70s - 686.10s |  So in this case, the scammer will use the technique of psychological manipulation.
686.10s - 692.82s |  So since these victims have already been victims of another scam, it's a tiny bit easy to psychologically
692.82s - 698.18s |  manipulate such victims further.
698.18s - 705.14s |  After this, the scammer is then able to lure the victim to the phishing website and extract
705.14s - 706.78s |  personal information.
706.78s - 713.14s |  So via the phishing pages that have been created by the scammer, and then exfiltrates
713.14s - 720.54s |  this information to a server that is under the control of the scammer.
720.54s - 725.72s |  After this, the scammer naturally wants to try and attract as many more victims as possible.
725.72s - 731.46s |  The scammer goes back to the social media groups where the first victim was acquired
731.46s - 737.34s |  and posts more fake comments on those groups to attract more victims.
737.34s - 742.14s |  Finally, the scammer makes money from this scam, either in the form of cryptocurrency
742.14s - 751.58s |  fees that the victim pays, and also the personal information of the victim that was obtained
751.58s - 755.51s |  via the phishing website.
755.51s - 758.93s |  So we saw the problems, we saw the solution, we saw an example.
758.93s - 761.89s |  So the natural question is, what are the benefits of this framework?
761.89s - 763.65s |  Is it really useful?
763.65s - 766.05s |  So yes, of course, the framework is useful.
766.05s - 768.93s |  It helps us to better understand the scam landscape.
768.93s - 774.41s |  In one of my previous slides, I explained about the several types of scams and the chaos
774.41s - 775.41s |  of scams.
775.41s - 781.13s |  So this framework helps to make sense out of that chaos, helps to formally define scams,
781.13s - 787.17s |  look below the surface of the scams, and not understand scams only in terms of examples,
787.17s - 793.97s |  but as tactics and techniques in a systematic fashion, which will help us to help others.
793.97s - 800.01s |  So to conclude, the F-Secure Scam Tactics and Techniques Framework is a systematic,
800.01s - 806.41s |  formal, comprehensive database of knowledge that we have acquired over the years.
806.41s - 816.61s |  And we hope to continuously evolve this framework so as to make it beneficial for others.
816.61s - 817.61s |  That's it from me.
817.61s - 818.17s |  Thank you very much.
