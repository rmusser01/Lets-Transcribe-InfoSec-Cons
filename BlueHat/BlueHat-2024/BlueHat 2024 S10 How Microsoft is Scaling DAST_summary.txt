**Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)**
- All engineering teams use SDL to ensure products align with Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative
- **Security testing**: A key component aimed at finding and mitigating security vulnerabilities

**Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**
- **DAST**: Dynamic Application Security Testing process to find vulnerabilities by testing software at runtime
- Challenges in scaling DAST include getting developers to provide service API specs, manual configuration, and scanning limitations

**DAST Tools**
- Examples include Burp Suite, Zap, Nuclei, Microsoft’s Wrestler, and Nikto
- Enterprises often struggle with running DAST tools at scale despite the availability of many tools

**Scaling DAST**
- **Challenges**: Need to know web endpoints exposed and ensure server’s logic processes requests
- Traditional methods of crawling and spidering websites don’t work for API-based web services

**Open API Specifications**
- Modern DAST tools allow users to input a list of service endpoints for scanning
- **Open API spec**: Document listing API endpoints and parameters, often in JSON or YAML format

**Automating Open API Spec Generation**
- Existing methods require access to source code, build environment, and integration by developers
- **Scalable solutions**: Monitoring requests and using automation to extrapolate open API specs, though limited by what traffic is seen

**Authentication and Authorization Challenges**
- **Credentials**: Necessary for testing, but manual configuration adds complexity
- **Centralized testing accounts**: Not scalable due to security risks and manual configuration needs

**Microsoft's Solution for Scaling DAST**
- **DAST agent development**: Deployable to first-party web services in non-production environments
- Agents eliminate the need for source code access and manual pipeline updates
- **Pipeline inspection**: Agents inspect memory at runtime to discover API endpoints and generate open API specs automatically

**Authentication and Authorization Bypass**
- Agents insert hooks to bypass normal authentication and authorization steps
- **Security benefits**: Eliminates need for testing credentials, reducing risk of compromise

**Confidential Containers**
- **Confidential containers**: Used for running DAST tools, ensuring security and preventing tampering
- Each container operates in its own pod, preventing communication and exfiltration risks

**Future Prospects and Advanced Concepts**
- **Code coverage monitoring**: Assessing percentage of code blocks executed during DAST scanning
- **AI integration**: Potential for identifying false positives and assessing risk confidence

**Conclusion**
- Microsoft is leveraging its control over Azure platforms to innovate in scaling DAST
- Continuous development and deployment of DAST agents aim to enhance security testing effectiveness.
