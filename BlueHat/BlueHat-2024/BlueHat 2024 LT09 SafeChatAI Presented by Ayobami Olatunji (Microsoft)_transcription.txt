  "description": "BlueHat 2024: LT09: SafeChatAI: Enhancing Cybersecurity Awareness Using Artificial Intelligence Presented by Ayobami Olatunji from Microsoft\n\nAbstract: The proliferation of digital devices and increased online communication have led to numerous cyber threats, particularly social engineering and phishing attacks, resulting in identity theft and impersonation. A significant factor contributing to the rise in online fraud is the lack of adequate cybersecurity awareness. Although various platforms and frameworks exist to enhance cybersecurity, they often fall short in providing real-time protection. This paper proposes SafeChatAI, a system designed to deliver real-time alerts when sensitive information, such as a Social Security Number (SSN), is requested via chat or email by an unknown individual. Additionally, SafeChatAI allows users to report suspicious activities directly to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), verify the identity of potential scammers, flag accounts as scammers, and notify other users of flagged individuals. By combining AI-driven monitoring with user participation, SafeChatAI aims to create a safer online environment and reduce online fraud.",

 Good afternoon, everyone.
1.68s - 4.96s |  My name is Ayobami Olatunji.
4.96s - 8.76s |  We're the Windows Security team here in Microsoft.
8.76s - 13.80s |  And today, we'll be talking about cybersecurity awareness
13.80s - 15.28s |  using artificial intelligence.
15.28s - 18.92s |  How can we make cybersecurity awareness better?
18.92s - 21.56s |  And let's go.
21.56s - 24.20s |  So we'll be looking at the introduction,
24.20s - 26.24s |  like what is cybersecurity awareness,
26.24s - 29.92s |  like the present solutions, what are the limitations,
29.92s - 32.24s |  what are the problems we have presently?
32.24s - 35.04s |  Also, like, how are the attackers,
35.04s - 37.56s |  like the scammers in this case, how are they
37.56s - 40.96s |  tricking users to get their identity,
40.96s - 43.44s |  trick them to scam them in various ways?
43.44s - 45.36s |  And also, like, what am I looking
45.36s - 48.36s |  at to be a kind of like a solution
48.36s - 52.44s |  to enhance awareness from what we have presently?
52.44s - 56.48s |  And I'm going to do a little bit of demo.
56.48s - 59.20s |  It's going to be a very, very short demo on how
59.20s - 61.76s |  the solution is expected to kind of like work
61.76s - 63.16s |  at the end of the day.
63.16s - 65.28s |  And we're going to talk about how
65.28s - 68.36s |  do we measure if we have been able to enhance
68.36s - 70.92s |  the security awareness of users.
70.92s - 74.48s |  Then since there's going to be a little bit of numbers,
74.48s - 76.08s |  there will be a reference at the end.
76.08s - 79.50s |  So let's go.
79.50s - 83.78s |  If I ask anyone here to share me their social security number,
83.78s - 85.70s |  if I ask you for your phone number,
85.70s - 87.78s |  and I'm going to text you a code,
87.78s - 91.50s |  will you be willing to share the code with me, anybody?
91.50s - 94.86s |  Who is going to send the social security number to me
94.86s - 98.18s |  and send me a code after it is a phone number?
98.18s - 99.02s |  OK, nobody.
99.02s - 100.86s |  That is what I'm expecting, because this
100.86s - 102.70s |  is a security conference.
102.70s - 105.10s |  And if you can still fall for that trick,
105.10s - 107.26s |  then maybe I will send you out of the conference.
107.26s - 112.22s |  So it is somehow that people are still
112.22s - 114.46s |  falling for that particular kind of trick.
114.46s - 116.74s |  But the truth is not all of us are
117.66s - 120.42s |  cyber security conscious.
120.42s - 123.98s |  The data is there to say that two out of five people
123.98s - 127.06s |  in this country have been a victim of one
127.06s - 130.58s |  form of scam or another, especially identity theft.
130.58s - 132.62s |  It is very, very rampant.
132.62s - 137.62s |  And even for a fact, seven out of 10 people in this country
137.62s - 141.10s |  are familiar with one person, at least one person,
141.10s - 143.54s |  who has been a victim of this crime.
143.54s - 148.38s |  This is for you to know how frequent this crime is
148.38s - 151.74s |  and how it is still working, despite all the fact
151.74s - 155.02s |  that organizations, both private and government organizations,
155.02s - 158.18s |  are doing a lot of things to create
158.18s - 160.42s |  an awareness of things you should do
160.42s - 162.46s |  and things you should not do.
162.46s - 165.78s |  The statistics shows almost 900,000 cases
165.78s - 168.58s |  were reported in 2023, and $10.3 billion
168.58s - 170.62s |  were accounted for.
170.62s - 171.98s |  That's a lot of money.
172.02s - 174.10s |  Let's leave the money part.
174.10s - 177.78s |  There is another danger part of this particular scam
177.78s - 182.78s |  is the fact that people are kind of like turning homeless,
182.78s - 183.86s |  losing their life.
183.86s - 186.42s |  Because when you lose your identity, which
186.42s - 188.74s |  is one of the things that happen when you are scammed
188.74s - 191.98s |  in this kind of situation, when you lose your identity,
191.98s - 194.22s |  it's like you lose yourself to somebody else.
194.22s - 197.34s |  And that person can commit crime in your name,
197.34s - 200.46s |  can do various things, and make you
200.46s - 203.94s |  somebody who is likely going to be in a situation like this.
203.94s - 208.22s |  So why is the traditional awareness system not working
208.22s - 211.02s |  or not helping or not good enough
211.02s - 212.62s |  to solve the problem that we have?
212.62s - 216.34s |  And how can we enhance the present system
216.34s - 220.10s |  to become much more better?
220.10s - 222.74s |  So like I said, the truth is technological space
222.74s - 224.58s |  is kind of evolving fast.
224.58s - 228.82s |  So the problem with the system that we have presently
228.82s - 231.06s |  for awareness is most of the time,
231.06s - 232.58s |  the documents are obsolete.
232.58s - 234.94s |  For example, if an attack happens now,
234.94s - 237.30s |  like this kind of scam attack that we are talking about,
237.30s - 241.02s |  if any of such happens now, before the document that
241.02s - 242.62s |  is being released of dos and don'ts
242.62s - 245.18s |  will be released for people to be aware of,
245.18s - 247.18s |  it's probably going to take one year.
247.18s - 249.74s |  Like 2023 edition or 2024 edition,
249.74s - 251.38s |  within that space of one year, there
251.38s - 253.70s |  is a gap for all these scammers, for them
253.70s - 256.54s |  to be able to scam a whole lot of people.
256.54s - 260.10s |  And also, people don't even know how well to report,
260.10s - 261.90s |  which is another problem of reporting.
261.90s - 264.42s |  So if somebody is scammed, let's say, for instance,
264.42s - 266.66s |  somebody tricked me into scamming,
266.66s - 269.62s |  and I fell into that scam, and I was scammed.
269.62s - 274.02s |  Now, the problem is, even if I know where to report
274.02s - 278.78s |  and I can report, before the next person here
278.78s - 280.26s |  can get access to that information,
280.26s - 282.94s |  for the person to be aware of that scam
282.94s - 284.46s |  and not to fall for it, it's going
284.46s - 287.98s |  to take probably years before the person can be aware.
287.98s - 290.42s |  So reporting is another problem that I
290.42s - 292.78s |  identify from this research.
292.78s - 295.26s |  And also, lack of real-time capability,
295.26s - 297.22s |  which is similar to what I just explained.
297.22s - 299.34s |  If I'm being scammed and I reported that,
299.34s - 302.62s |  there is no way for you to be able to get that in real time
302.62s - 304.38s |  and be aware that this kind of scam
304.38s - 307.22s |  is a way you can protect yourself.
307.22s - 310.46s |  So those are the three problems that the present system
310.46s - 314.66s |  is facing presently.
314.66s - 318.98s |  So let me show you the trick that these scammers use.
318.98s - 321.42s |  Most of the time, this is what they do.
321.42s - 322.66s |  They have a format.
322.66s - 325.26s |  It's not like there's anything extra.
325.26s - 327.14s |  This is gotten online.
327.14s - 328.66s |  It's everywhere.
328.66s - 332.22s |  You see it online, on Twitter, on Facebook, everywhere,
332.22s - 333.90s |  where they pull this format.
333.90s - 336.14s |  So this is just a typical example
336.14s - 339.70s |  of you setting an exam.
339.70s - 343.10s |  And these scammers, they have the answer to the exam
343.10s - 344.62s |  already in the exam hall.
344.62s - 347.94s |  And me and you, we are also in the same exam hall.
347.94s - 350.06s |  But we don't even know the question.
350.06s - 351.70s |  We've not even read the material.
351.70s - 353.82s |  But they have all the answers to everything.
353.82s - 357.18s |  So when they send you a message like, hey, this,
357.18s - 359.74s |  they know what they are expecting from you.
359.74s - 362.22s |  Based on your response, they know what to send next.
362.22s - 365.38s |  Me and you might be able to bypass this trick because
365.38s - 367.34s |  of our experience and our background.
367.34s - 369.22s |  But look around you.
369.22s - 371.22s |  When you're at the airport, at the train station,
371.22s - 374.34s |  millions of people who do not have any background
374.34s - 376.22s |  in these kind of cases, they tend
376.22s - 379.54s |  to fall into this kind of scam easily.
379.54s - 382.78s |  As easy and simple as this is, it is something
382.78s - 385.14s |  that most people fall into.
385.14s - 389.62s |  So how can we think of a way to also, like I said,
389.62s - 393.82s |  this is like a textbook answer for them in an exam hall.
393.82s - 396.46s |  So how can we also create our own advantage
396.46s - 399.70s |  by making sure that we have our own textbook
399.70s - 405.18s |  and our own answer to exam during the exam?
405.18s - 407.50s |  So the solution that I'm talking about,
407.50s - 411.06s |  that I'm looking into here, is a way
411.06s - 415.86s |  of how we can use the capability of AI, like large language
415.86s - 419.94s |  model, to build a solution that kind of addresses
419.94s - 422.94s |  the three problems that we have identified,
422.94s - 426.06s |  at least to a great level, if not real time.
426.06s - 429.82s |  In order for us also to remember something,
429.82s - 434.58s |  say for instance, when people read about like,
434.58s - 438.58s |  don't click on this link, don't send anybody your SSN number,
438.58s - 440.54s |  don't send anybody your phone number,
440.54s - 442.42s |  don't do this and that, they tend
442.42s - 447.06s |  to forget in the moment when that action is particularly on.
447.06s - 448.06s |  They don't remember.
448.06s - 448.94s |  They've forgotten.
448.94s - 451.38s |  I mean, just like me and you, we've read so many things
451.38s - 454.34s |  and we do not even remember everything,
454.34s - 455.78s |  like most of those things anymore.
455.98s - 458.10s |  So just like typical people, too,
458.10s - 460.26s |  they've forgotten all those things.
460.26s - 463.02s |  And when the time comes, they tend to fall into this.
463.02s - 466.26s |  So how can we create a solution that's kind of like,
466.26s - 470.18s |  in real time, when it signals or sends something like this,
470.18s - 472.50s |  it's kind of like, give them a prompt.
472.50s - 473.90s |  I showed you a format.
473.90s - 475.42s |  Those are the things that they use.
475.42s - 478.30s |  Those are typical things that most of these guys use.
478.30s - 479.74s |  It is available online.
479.74s - 481.54s |  It's available on IC3 report, which
481.54s - 484.30s |  is like FBI database for crime like this,
484.30s - 487.02s |  and available almost on all other platforms.
487.02s - 488.38s |  So let's look at it together.
488.38s - 494.02s |  Is there a way we can kind of like train,
494.02s - 496.46s |  use this data to train a system that
496.46s - 500.78s |  can be like a plug-in on almost all the platforms
500.78s - 503.26s |  that we use frequently, like Facebook, like Twitter,
503.26s - 506.90s |  like WhatsApp, like iMessage, and stuff like that?
506.90s - 511.50s |  And any time the pattern at which we've seen before,
511.50s - 514.02s |  any time those patterns occur, this system
514.06s - 516.90s |  can be able to kind of like send something
516.90s - 519.22s |  and probably not block automatically,
519.22s - 521.90s |  but warn you of things that you should do
521.90s - 523.30s |  and things that you should not do.
523.30s - 525.82s |  And I will explain to you how that kind of system
525.82s - 530.38s |  can enhance the three problems at which we identify
530.38s - 532.02s |  with the traditional method.
532.02s - 535.34s |  So let me quickly show you a little demo of how this works.
539.50s - 542.22s |  So this is not like a real WhatsApp,
542.22s - 543.54s |  for you to be aware of.
543.54s - 546.70s |  This is just like a Sigma design to just like demo
546.70s - 550.78s |  what we are talking about, how to enhance those three
550.78s - 552.74s |  problems that we have identified.
552.74s - 555.62s |  So the first thing is, most of these guys,
555.62s - 557.38s |  they claim to be who they are not.
557.38s - 561.58s |  So this is somebody claiming to be a military person.
561.58s - 563.70s |  It is easy to claim a military person,
563.70s - 566.22s |  because most of the time, they are always out of town.
566.22s - 567.58s |  They are being deployed out.
567.58s - 570.30s |  And claim to be a military person,
570.30s - 574.02s |  this is our solution that has been integrated
574.02s - 575.82s |  into this particular chat.
575.82s - 578.54s |  And it has access to the conversation
578.54s - 580.14s |  based on the data.
580.14s - 583.70s |  Now, this person is chatting, chatting real quick,
583.70s - 587.82s |  like hello, some of those things, which
587.82s - 591.02s |  we've seen in the initial slides.
591.02s - 592.98s |  Now, it has gotten to a point when
592.98s - 595.02s |  this person needs this particular information,
595.02s - 598.22s |  like your social security number and other details.
598.22s - 599.30s |  Now it is asking.
599.30s - 602.58s |  So this person that is chatting has
602.58s - 606.14s |  forgotten that he or she has read somewhere that do not share
606.14s - 608.46s |  your social security number, because it's been a while.
608.46s - 611.10s |  And this seems like a genuine chat.
611.10s - 613.14s |  But it's kind of like coming from a format
613.14s - 615.22s |  that we have shown before.
615.22s - 618.50s |  This solution would be able to, at this time,
618.50s - 621.34s |  follow the pattern, see the similarities,
621.34s - 623.66s |  see the signature at which this person is chatting,
623.66s - 628.14s |  and at this time, send you a warning.
628.14s - 629.86s |  Before you proceed, this person is
629.86s - 631.58s |  asking you for sensitive information,
631.58s - 633.22s |  is asking you for this and that.
633.22s - 636.74s |  Based on the telemetry that we've known,
636.74s - 640.38s |  this seems to be more like a scam than true.
640.38s - 643.82s |  This is to make sure that this person at this particular time
643.82s - 646.98s |  make a much more informed decision in this case.
646.98s - 649.66s |  So that helps, like the obsolete document problem
649.66s - 651.54s |  is a little bit like now being solved,
651.54s - 653.10s |  because now this person does not need
653.10s - 656.06s |  to get the document of this information
656.06s - 657.94s |  anymore or continue reading.
657.94s - 661.02s |  With this, he or she can be able to get this thing done.
661.02s - 665.26s |  Also, we have a way to report.
665.26s - 668.30s |  As you can see, you can link multiple chats.
668.30s - 674.38s |  And also, there's a report part of this, which are, OK,
674.38s - 675.62s |  there's a report part of this.
675.62s - 677.34s |  Let me explain how the report part works.
677.34s - 679.74s |  With just a click, you can report,
679.74s - 681.50s |  like, oh, this particular phone number
681.50s - 684.02s |  is trying to chat me up with this.
684.02s - 685.54s |  This person is a flag.
685.58s - 688.74s |  And when you report this, FBI identify in their report
688.74s - 690.90s |  that one of the major problems that they are having
690.90s - 694.30s |  is because people do not report cases like this on time.
694.30s - 696.70s |  And people don't even report at all most times
696.70s - 699.66s |  until it has become very, very problematic.
699.66s - 701.62s |  With this kind of report, the system
701.62s - 703.66s |  itself automatically, like, knows the number,
703.66s - 704.66s |  clean.
704.66s - 705.78s |  I don't know why this slide is not moving
705.78s - 706.98s |  to that particular slide.
706.98s - 708.58s |  But the thing is, there is a part that
708.58s - 710.66s |  shows the number of people who has reported
710.66s - 712.46s |  that particular number in the case.
712.46s - 715.26s |  Like, oh, 25 people have reported this number for a fraud.
715.46s - 717.14s |  And it has been known for impersonation
717.14s - 718.34s |  in the last two months.
718.34s - 719.38s |  Please be careful.
719.38s - 722.82s |  So this kind of, like, take the real-time problem away
722.82s - 724.38s |  and now gives you the opportunity
724.38s - 726.94s |  to be able to, like, make a better informed
726.94s - 728.66s |  decision in that regard.
728.66s - 730.74s |  So with that, we've been able to, like,
730.74s - 733.62s |  come up with a solution that is capable of solving
733.62s - 735.62s |  some of those problems.
735.62s - 746.98s |  And, OK, I think we can, OK.
746.98s - 749.98s |  So what is, how do we measure, like,
749.98s - 752.86s |  this has been a success, provided that this actually,
752.86s - 754.74s |  like, gets, like, out there?
754.74s - 756.90s |  Like, one of the thing is, it's going
756.90s - 758.82s |  to be saving citizens billions of dollars.
758.82s - 763.46s |  Like I said, $10.3 billion were lost, like, in 2023 alone.
763.46s - 764.90s |  That is just for 2023.
764.90s - 767.62s |  Like, saving that is a whole lot of money.
767.62s - 769.78s |  Empowering everyone to make informed decisions.
769.78s - 771.74s |  Yes, people have been making decisions
771.74s - 775.54s |  based on, you know, instinct or emotion and all like that.
775.54s - 777.06s |  But with this kind of solution, they
777.06s - 780.02s |  will be able to make much more informed decisions.
780.02s - 783.10s |  Also, elevating every human to be a super human.
783.10s - 786.14s |  As somebody in security, and I believe
786.14s - 789.02s |  we are super human because of what we do.
789.02s - 791.58s |  With this kind of solution, you reporting alone
791.58s - 793.34s |  also helps other people.
793.34s - 795.62s |  That makes you a super human.
795.62s - 797.10s |  And also, like, real-time reporting
797.10s - 798.02s |  for efficient tracking.
798.02s - 800.22s |  This also, like, helps security organizations
800.22s - 802.58s |  to be able to, like, have access to, like, real-time
802.58s - 805.54s |  and adequate information about the kind of, like,
805.54s - 806.82s |  threat that people are facing.
806.82s - 811.14s |  The kind of, like, attack that's a scam scheme and tricks
811.14s - 813.98s |  that people are facing in real-time.
813.98s - 817.94s |  So I quoted a lot of data, a lot of information.
817.94s - 820.34s |  This is just, like, you know, the link to, like, all those
820.34s - 821.50s |  data where they come from.
821.50s - 824.62s |  And the Figma design is actually kind of, like, you know,
824.62s - 825.38s |  elaborated.
825.38s - 827.66s |  There are so many methods, so many things
827.66s - 830.14s |  that was unable to display here, which you can also, like,
830.14s - 831.58s |  get from the slides.
831.58s - 832.94s |  And that's it.
832.94s - 834.74s |  Thank you.
