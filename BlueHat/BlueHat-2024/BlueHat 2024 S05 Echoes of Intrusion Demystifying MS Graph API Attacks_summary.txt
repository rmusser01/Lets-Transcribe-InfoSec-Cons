**Event Overview**
- **Title:** BlueHat 2024: Echoes of Intrusion: Demystifying MS Graph API Attacks
- **Presenter:** Miriam Wiesner from Microsoft
- **Platform:** Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) YouTube channel
- **Duration:** 1616 seconds
- **Upload Date:** November 8, 2024

**Presentation Abstract**
- **Focus:** Investigating and simulating MS Graph API attacks
- **Objective:** Provide insights into how adversaries use the MS Graph API to breach defenses, implant persistence mechanisms, and exfiltrate data
- **Method:** Live demonstration of attack simulations

**Microsoft Graph API**
- **Definition:** An interface to query and control everything within Microsoft 365
- **Capabilities:** With the right permissions, it is quite powerful
- **Tools:** Graph Explorer is useful for beginners

**Demo Overview**
- **Setup:** Using Cloud Katana to obtain access tokens
- **Tools Used:** PowerShell Invoke REST method
- **Parameters Required:** URI, header, HTTP method
- **Example Scenario:** Changing a password using the Graph API

**Attack Simulation**
- **Steps:** 
  - Initial access via password spraying
  - Reconnaissance to understand the environment
  - Privilege escalation to gain higher access
  - Persistence establishment to maintain access
  - Data exfiltration, focusing on extracting emails

**Defensive Strategies**
- **Password Management:** Educate users on selecting strong passwords
- **Security Measures:** Implement MFA, conditional access, and avoid legacy authentication
- **Configuration Awareness:** Understand and assess configurations, especially regarding owner attributes and permissions
- **Monitoring:** Watch for anomalies like multiple account probes from the same IP
- **Identity Protection:** Secure identities with high permissions to prevent privilege escalation

**Tools and Scripts**
- **GitHub Repository:** Contains scripts and resources related to the presentation
- **Defensive Script:** Allows defenders to query service principal permissions and identify potential vulnerabilities

**Final Recommendations**
- **Assessment:** Regularly review and restrict high-privileged roles and service principles
- **Data Protection:** Encrypt emails and sensitive data to prevent unauthorized extraction
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Utilize XDR and Microsoft Graph activity monitoring for suspicious behavior detection
- **Audit and Reporting:** Export data for analysis using tools like Excel to understand service principal permissions and configurations

**Conclusion**
- **Call to Action:** Use the knowledge gained to stay ahead of potential attackers and secure your environment effectively.
