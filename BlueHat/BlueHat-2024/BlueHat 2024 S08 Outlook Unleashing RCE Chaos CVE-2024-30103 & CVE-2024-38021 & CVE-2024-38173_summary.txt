**BlueHat 2024: Outlook RCE Vulnerabilities**

- **Session Overview:**
  - Focus on Outlook vulnerabilities: CVE-2024-30103, CVE-2024-38021, CVE-2024-38173
  - Presentation by Michael Gorelik from Morphisec
  - Exploration of remote code execution (**RCE**) through Outlook vulnerabilities

**Patch Tuesday:**
- Regular updates for security vulnerabilities
- Urgency due to short disclosure policies
- Challenges in delivering complete fixes without disrupting applications

**Vulnerability Discovery:**
- New vulnerabilities discovered monthly
- Emphasis on form injection and moniker vulnerabilities
- Vulnerabilities require prior authentication for exploitation

**Form Injection Vulnerabilities:**
- **Forms in Outlook:** Based on **MAPI Forms**
- **Custom Forms:** Created using configuration files (**CFG**) or built-in editors
- **Malicious Forms:** Injected into victim environments using synchronization protocols
- **Deny List:** Used by Microsoft to prevent unauthorized form registration

**Moniker Vulnerabilities:**
- **Monikers:** Interface for accessing objects in documents
- **Common Types:** URL and file monikers
- **Exploitation:** Through improperly parsed links leading to NTLM leaks and potential RCE

**Security Patches and Fixes:**
- Microsoftâ€™s approach: Sequential security updates
- Initial patch removed relative paths; subsequent patches improved validation mechanisms
- Use of hot patching to protect Office applications specifically

**Recommendations:**
- **Hardening Environment:** Block outbound traffic, enforce **Kerberos** authentication
- **Monitor Registry:** For suspicious keys and forms
- **Stay Updated:** Apply all security patches promptly

**Conclusion:**
- Importance of collaboration between researchers and Microsoft
- Ongoing efforts to secure digital environments and applications
