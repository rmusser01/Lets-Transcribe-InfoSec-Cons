  "description": "BlueHat 2024: LT08: Ransomware Resilience: Turning the Tide Against Cyber Extortion by Tom Williams (True Zero Technologies)\n\nAbstract: Ransomware attacks have become a pervasive threat to global organizations, causing substantial financial losses over the past decade. The increase in successful ransomware attacks is driven by multiple factors and the issue has proven challenging to track by the industry and researchers. A major obstacle to accurately quantifying the impact lies in the fragmented nature of available data and the lack of centralized oversight. This call to action takes a multidisciplinary perspective to analyzing cybersecurity risk and ransomware threats across various industries and provides insights into the vulnerability profiles of sectors targeted by ransomware operators. Furthermore, this study examines the challenges associated with mitigating these risks, including the technological evolution of attack variants, sophistication of tooling in the AI/ML era, and the importance of readiness.",

0.00s - 4.42s | This text was transcribed using whisper model: large-v2

 Well, I'm just going to kind of dive right in and start with a question for everyone.
4.42s - 8.32s |  If your data was suddenly inaccessible, could you recover?
8.32s - 11.48s |  Now just keep this in the back of your mind as we go through the talk.
11.48s - 13.76s |  Now who am I and why am I asking this question?
13.76s - 15.60s |  So my name is Dr. Tom Williams.
15.60s - 20.48s |  I'm a husband, a father, a security practitioner, and I've been in the industry close to 17,
20.48s - 22.66s |  18 years, somewhere around there.
22.66s - 26.64s |  I have a background in offensive and defensive cyber operations, securing critical infrastructure
26.64s - 28.24s |  within the DoD.
28.24s - 33.32s |  And I'm also an academic, so I have published research internationally on cybersecurity
33.32s - 36.96s |  and also IT leadership strategy.
36.96s - 41.18s |  Now in my off time, when I do decide to take it, I'm also a private pilot, and I decided
41.18s - 44.68s |  to share a picture here that went really well with the slide deck theme because of that
44.68s - 45.68s |  blue color.
45.68s - 47.84s |  But that was one of the most thrilling rides I had ever taken.
47.84s - 52.96s |  I got an opportunity to pilot a real warbird from World War II.
52.96s - 59.12s |  Now this topic, in the agenda here, I want you to focus on the question and contextualize
59.12s - 63.28s |  it to yourself as either a business leader, an individual contributor, or just a member
63.28s - 64.96s |  of society in general.
64.96s - 67.04s |  What does access to your data look like?
67.04s - 72.18s |  So as we go through these talking points, just think about that.
72.18s - 76.06s |  I want to start with the foundational research for the topic.
76.06s - 80.98s |  So I started this research around 2020 as I was looking for a subject for my doctoral
80.98s - 83.78s |  research, and I needed to answer a few questions.
83.90s - 89.02s |  I was looking to understand ransomware as it relates to trends across various industries,
89.02s - 91.46s |  and I needed data to help answer some questions.
91.46s - 96.52s |  And ultimately, what I discovered when pursuing this subject initially was that it was very
96.52s - 101.22s |  difficult to answer any of those questions, primarily because the data, or any data that
101.22s - 106.30s |  would be available, was not either disclosed or was fragmented.
106.30s - 109.74s |  And one of the primary factors related to that is that when institutions or organizations
109.74s - 114.46s |  are affected by ransomware, they simply would not disclose the information.
114.46s - 118.78s |  And this consensus was agreed upon by other individual researchers and organizations.
118.78s - 121.02s |  So again, very difficult to answer the question.
121.02s - 125.28s |  So what I decided to do, instead of just giving up and starting on another path, I decided
125.28s - 130.50s |  to build my own data set using the SEC's EDGAR system.
130.50s - 137.22s |  And essentially, this system is publicly available, and you can pull publicly traded company information
137.22s - 139.06s |  and analyze it.
139.06s - 142.10s |  I have three primary phases to this.
142.10s - 146.54s |  The data collection phase is essentially querying the data, pulling it from the system.
146.54s - 150.58s |  And then I have some machine learning and natural language processing going on on the
150.58s - 156.06s |  second phase to where we are able to reveal cybersecurity and ransomware risk insights
156.06s - 159.94s |  from the text corpus within the annual filings of these companies.
159.94s - 165.30s |  Now, some information about the data set here on the slide, we started out with around 37,000
165.30s - 166.30s |  companies.
166.54s - 171.02s |  And as you can see, I had to whittle that down to somewhere around 2,928, mainly because
171.02s - 175.08s |  the study was conducted between 2018 and 2022.
175.08s - 180.74s |  And during that period, with COVID in effect, there were some leniency and some filings
180.74s - 184.38s |  that were, the federal government allowed companies to delay their filings.
184.38s - 186.38s |  And so I needed a complete data set.
186.38s - 190.42s |  And for that reason, I needed filings for all five years from all companies.
190.42s - 194.22s |  And we landed with representation of roughly 146 industries.
196.28s - 201.28s |  Now, in academia, we're really looking for statistical significance.
201.28s - 207.24s |  And one of the things that you kind of look for in the industry as a practice is strong
207.24s - 208.24s |  correlation.
208.24s - 213.48s |  And I want to share one of the most interesting insights that came from the data set is that
213.48s - 220.00s |  over the years from 2018 to 2020, risk was relatively low, or at least risk indicators.
220.64s - 226.20s |  As we move from 2020 to 2022, we start to see a rise in risk across various industries.
226.20s - 231.60s |  And a lot of those industries, coincidentally, were healthcare, banks, and technology companies
231.60s - 234.88s |  as we started to see them kind of peak.
234.88s - 239.00s |  This correlation, I was able to validate my research and my research methodology with
239.00s - 242.20s |  other independent researchers and organizations around the world.
242.20s - 248.32s |  And by validating that this, I was able to kind of see that my data set and my methodology
248.32s - 249.32s |  was sound.
250.32s - 254.84s |  Now, for those who have paid attention within the last year, roughly, there has actually
254.84s - 258.76s |  been legislation passed by the federal government within the United States to where certain
258.76s - 264.08s |  companies that are associated with critical infrastructure are now required to disclose
264.08s - 266.44s |  of cybersecurity incidents and information.
266.44s - 270.32s |  So I was a little ahead of the legislation.
270.32s - 272.24s |  I think that was coincidental.
272.24s - 273.40s |  I'm not sure.
273.40s - 278.12s |  But going into the near future, as the companies are required to disclose of this information,
278.12s - 285.10s |  we'll be able to gain more insights and understanding as far as risk and ransomware and its impact.
285.10s - 288.02s |  So let's take a look at the timeline.
288.02s - 289.38s |  Ransomware is not new.
289.38s - 291.02s |  It's been around for over 30 years.
291.02s - 296.10s |  But the difference today is we're not necessarily finding ransomware on floppy disk and having
296.10s - 299.06s |  to send checks to Panama, right?
299.06s - 302.54s |  If we look at the timeline and move ahead to the year 2000, I have a little bit of a
302.54s - 306.02s |  red mark there, primarily because this is one of the first times in history that it
306.02s - 311.50s |  was collectively understood that access to technology, data, and services was important
311.50s - 313.06s |  to society, right?
313.06s - 316.66s |  Everyone was concerned about Y2K and its impact.
316.66s - 317.66s |  And there was a lot of unknowns.
317.66s - 320.02s |  Thankfully, it was a non-event.
320.02s - 321.30s |  But still, there was concern, right?
321.30s - 322.30s |  We need data.
322.30s - 326.22s |  We need to be able to access it because our daily lives rely on it.
326.22s - 331.46s |  We saw a little bit of ransomware activity around 2004, a little bit more around 2009.
331.46s - 336.34s |  But thanks to folks like who are here at Blue Hat, we're able to kind of squash that.
336.34s - 340.50s |  They used symmetric encryption, and it was relatively simple for us to kind of stop that
340.50s - 342.70s |  from happening.
342.70s - 347.34s |  Fast forward just a little bit to 2013, and that's when we see the birth of what is considered
347.34s - 349.00s |  modern ransomware.
349.00s - 354.10s |  So the ransomware that we're fighting today started, or at least the techniques and methodologies
354.10s - 360.98s |  that they're using, started in 2013 and continued to accelerate in 2016.
361.50s - 366.18s |  Now, there wasn't a lot understood about this malware at the time, but we knew that it was
366.18s - 371.82s |  more impactful, or at least observationally for us in operations and research.
371.82s - 376.58s |  In 2016, we started seeing full-scale criminal operations where they essentially have fully
376.58s - 382.34s |  staffed teams targeting organizations and trying to extort money, right?
382.34s - 385.10s |  Once they get into your network, they're going to do a little bit of reconnaissance, they're
385.10s - 388.82s |  going to look for leverage, and then they're going to try to encrypt, lock you out, and
388.82s - 389.82s |  extort.
390.82s - 398.38s |  Now, in 2021, this is one of the first known cases of ransomware impacting critical infrastructure,
398.38s - 403.46s |  known disclosed cases anyway, and this affected the East Coast primarily.
403.46s - 407.50s |  But still, we started to see ransomware still be problematic.
407.50s - 411.78s |  Now if we fast forward just a little bit to today, ransomware is more of a global challenge
411.78s - 415.16s |  than we may have expected it to be 10 years ago, right?
415.16s - 418.94s |  They're not just encrypting file systems, they're actually going beyond that, right?
419.06s - 424.30s |  Cyber-defined data centers have enabled threat actors to just encrypt full virtual machines,
424.30s - 427.98s |  operating systems, infrastructures, disrupt business operations, and then of course you
427.98s - 431.92s |  have a lot of leverage to extort money.
431.92s - 434.42s |  And why is this happening?
434.42s - 439.38s |  Cyberspace may not be a real place, but it absolutely has real-world effects, and ransomware
439.38s - 441.14s |  is highly lucrative.
441.14s - 446.58s |  There are no boundaries, there are no virtual or legal, physical boundaries, and more recently
446.58s - 450.26s |  I would dare say there are no moral boundaries for these threat actors.
450.26s - 453.58s |  And the reason I say that is because for the first time in history we actually have
453.58s - 460.53s |  confirmed cases of loss of human life due to a successful ransomware attack.
460.53s - 462.61s |  Anonymity is also on the threat actor side.
462.61s - 466.25s |  There's a lot of tools out there that are available to help them hide, make them very
466.25s - 467.73s |  difficult to track down.
467.73s - 471.13s |  And even if we're in law enforcement with the United States and you're trying to track
471.13s - 476.53s |  down a threat actor, it's very possible they're going to be across borders, physical or otherwise,
476.53s - 480.59s |  and there's a lot of pieces there that make it difficult to get a handle on it, at least
480.59s - 485.10s |  without collaboration from other governments.
485.10s - 488.02s |  Creativity is also limitless.
488.02s - 492.34s |  These threat actors have the element of surprise on their side, and so for that reason we're
492.34s - 494.46s |  always reacting and responding, right?
494.46s - 498.16s |  We don't know exactly what they're going to do until we see it.
498.16s - 501.10s |  And last but not least, AI is assisting with skill gaps.
501.10s - 504.54s |  So AI is a phenomenal educational tool, and in the hands of a threat actor they're able
504.54s - 509.50s |  to move and shake just a little bit faster, and of course we're trying to keep up.
509.50s - 511.66s |  Now I'm going to put some numbers up here real quick.
511.66s - 517.06s |  $37 million was the highest known ransomware payout paid to a threat actor in 2021.
517.06s - 520.46s |  By 2023 that number had almost doubled to $75 million.
520.46s - 524.18s |  Now if you're a business leader and you're put in the situation where your organization
524.18s - 528.26s |  is being extorted for money and the survival of that organization is going to be determined
528.26s - 534.26s |  by whether or not you can get your data, access of your data back, you really don't want to
534.26s - 536.78s |  realize the true value of your data.
536.78s - 540.22s |  You want to be prepared.
540.22s - 544.30s |  Now the impact of artificial intelligence is going to be somewhat speculative, but I
544.30s - 548.30s |  will disclose what I've seen already and the potential of what we're going to see in the
548.30s - 550.86s |  near term.
550.86s - 553.94s |  Sophisticated contextualized social engineering is already in effect.
553.94s - 557.58s |  So of course these threat actors are using the very same tools that we're building and
557.58s - 562.98s |  using to make ourselves more productive and ourselves as security researchers more effective
562.98s - 566.74s |  at what we're doing, but threat actors are able to leverage them just the same, right?
566.74s - 570.62s |  Tools may be built for good, but they can be used in malicious ways, and it's no different.
570.62s - 573.26s |  Our AI is no different.
573.26s - 576.46s |  We're going to see accelerated threat vector discovery by these threat actors.
576.46s - 580.30s |  A lot of ransomware attacks, they're really just looking for a way in.
580.30s - 584.38s |  Of course, phishing is going to be one of the key ways to enter the network.
584.38s - 588.90s |  But if you're paying attention more recently, in some cases they're just going to come in
588.90s - 594.14s |  through your VPN network or whatever vector they can find, and to discover those vectors
594.14s - 599.88s |  they're going to be using artificial intelligence tooling to assist.
599.88s - 602.56s |  We will very likely see advances in cryptobiology.
602.56s - 607.32s |  So if you're familiar with the techniques used to evade detection during the encryption
607.32s - 611.04s |  process so that they can encrypt as much of the environment as possible, you know that
611.04s - 613.48s |  they've been changing, right?
613.48s - 616.08s |  Sometimes you don't need to encrypt all the data, sometimes just a few pieces of it.
616.08s - 620.84s |  But with the assistance of AI, the threat actors are very likely going to get very creative
620.84s - 626.92s |  at evading detection while they're encrypting data.
626.92s - 632.24s |  Last but certainly not least, we can see just by looking at what AI has become in the last
632.24s - 636.80s |  24 months, and it's very safe to assume that there's going to be a very rapid evolution
636.80s - 641.40s |  in malicious code being generated and built, and also the tooling and methods by these
641.40s - 642.60s |  threat actors.
642.60s - 646.56s |  And the primary reason for that, we on the good side are outnumbered, and there's a lot
646.56s - 650.60s |  of threat actors out there, and they can be everywhere from anywhere, so we're all fighting
650.60s - 656.03s |  the good fight as best we can, but it is a numbers game.
656.03s - 660.63s |  Now how do we turn the tide, right, the purpose of this talk?
660.63s - 665.55s |  Becoming cyber resilient, knowing that we're behind, not because we're not effective at
665.55s - 669.31s |  what we do, but just because of the sheer numbers of threat actors out there.
669.31s - 673.79s |  We have to accept that it's only a matter of time before we are affected by some type
673.79s - 679.35s |  of cyber attack, whether it's ransomware or otherwise, especially as business leaders.
679.35s - 683.23s |  In order to combat it, and to get ahead of the threat actor, you can position yourself
683.23s - 688.35s |  ahead of the threat actor just by accepting it, and becoming, or at least building more
688.35s - 692.19s |  harmonious security operations teams within your organization.
692.19s - 694.95s |  And that takes a top-down approach, but also bottom-up.
694.95s - 700.23s |  So as individual contributors, we know the ugly of our infrastructure, and sometimes
700.23s - 702.91s |  you have to face the hard questions.
702.91s - 706.83s |  Maybe there's a server, we all know about it, and this is real, I deal with this daily
706.83s - 707.83s |  with my clients.
708.11s - 711.51s |  There's a server in the environment that we know is something we need to do something
711.51s - 714.11s |  about, but we just can't shut that down, right?
714.11s - 718.47s |  Well, I would challenge you to do something about it while you're still in control, because
718.47s - 722.19s |  if a threat actor gets in your network, and they're able to find that server, they won't
722.19s - 724.59s |  hesitate.
724.59s - 728.63s |  Invest in modernizing the infrastructure, because visibility is going to be key, right?
728.63s - 731.75s |  You need to know what's on your network, what's in your network, and where your data flows
731.75s - 733.23s |  are.
733.23s - 736.59s |  There's been a lot of that going on over the last 10 years, right, moving from on-prem
736.59s - 740.87s |  to cloud, but a good many organizations landed somewhere in the middle.
740.87s - 744.63s |  So we have these hybrid environments now, and there's a good bit of an abstraction between
744.63s - 748.83s |  the infrastructure and the operations, but as business leaders, or individual contributors
748.83s - 753.91s |  helping companies, we know, or should be able to identify what's tied to revenue-generating
753.91s - 760.27s |  operations and services, and implement advanced protection strategies to protect that.
760.27s - 763.11s |  Last but certainly not least, you want to invest in being proactive, and a lot of us
763.11s - 764.87s |  are already doing that today.
764.87s - 769.95s |  This ransomware issue is primarily an issue due to a lack of information, lack of knowledge
769.95s - 773.91s |  sharing, and overall lack of understanding of what the true impact is.
773.91s - 779.39s |  And we are starting to see government and non-government organizations look to provide
779.39s - 786.31s |  at least resources and frameworks to help mitigate the problem, but we really need more
786.31s - 791.27s |  information so that we can understand the full scope of impact globally.
791.27s - 794.51s |  On the right-hand side, I have a few advanced protection strategies listed, but this certainly
794.51s - 798.67s |  won't be all of them, but micro-segmentation, zero-trust architecture, defense in-depth,
798.67s - 804.63s |  and 3-2-1 backup practices are all very effective at helping contain the threat and mitigate
804.63s - 807.63s |  the risk while you're still in control.
807.63s - 812.19s |  As business leaders, or individual contributors, as I mentioned earlier, you really want to
812.19s - 816.67s |  focus on surviving, and in order to do that, you need business continuity and resilience
816.67s - 822.31s |  plans that allow you to adapt and recover within the acceptable parameters of your organization.
822.31s - 825.43s |  And to do that, we've got to face some of the very difficult and tough conversations.
825.43s - 832.05s |  I'm going to leave everyone with this quote in closing, far and away the best prize that
832.05s - 836.97s |  life offers is a chance to work hard at work worth doing, and that's Theodore Roosevelt.
836.97s - 840.81s |  Now I post this up here because as a security practitioner myself and an advocate for a
840.81s - 846.13s |  safer internet and overall digital world, I'm doing what I can to share what I'm seeing
846.13s - 848.13s |  and also encourage you all to do the same.
848.13s - 851.97s |  So as you leave Blue Hat this year and you go back home, take a look in every cardinal
