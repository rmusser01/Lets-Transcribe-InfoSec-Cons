**Event Overview**
- **BlueHat 2024: S13: Patterns in the Shadows: Scaling Threat Hunting & Intel for Modern Adversaries**
- Presented by Mark Parsons and Colin Cowie from **Sophos**
- Focus on implementing and scaling a successful **threat hunt & intel program**
- Highlighting the symbiotic relationship between threat hunting and intelligence to enhance **security operations**

**Threat Clustering and Case Studies**
- **Threat Clustering:** Group related threat activities exhibiting specific patterns
- **Mandiant and CrowdStrike**: Key historical players in threat clustering
- **STAC6451 Case Study:** Ransomware actor automating Mimic ransomware deployment
- **SPADE Tool:** Identified STAC6451 through anomaly-based hunting
- **Challenges and Successes:** Clustering with multiple threat actors in the same environment
- **Nation State Actors:** Using distinct patterns of life to identify unique hunt opportunities
- **Tracking Clusters:** Importance of monitoring clusters over time using statistical analysis and data visualization tools

**Threat Hunting Methodologies**
- **Indicator-Driven:** Track actors over time using command-and-control infrastructure patterns
- **Behavior-Driven:** Look for specific techniques, e.g., Acura Ransomware's R-clone command line
- **Anomaly-Driven:** Use statistical methods to identify new threat actors and clusters

**Data and Tools for Threat Intelligence**
- **Sophos MDR Service:** Grew from 2,000 to 20,000 customers, leveraging OpenCTI and Python for data analysis
- **Web Platform for Intel Analysts:** Uses DataTables, Plotly, and pyViz for data presentation
- **Incident Comparison:** Identify overlaps and new clusters by comparing malware, tools, and attack patterns

**Advanced Case Studies and Analysis**
- **Cluster Alpha, Bravo, Charlie:** Detailed investigation of different threat clusters within the same network
- **Patterns of Life:** Assess adversary activity over time to make informed assessments
- **Collaboration with Sophos Labs:** Investigating new techniques like agent shimming

**Key Learnings and Takeaways**
- **Automation and Statistical Methods:** Essential for scaling threat hunting and intelligence capabilities
- **External Attribution Assessments:** Can be exhausting; focus on high-quality data
- **Communication:** Critical between hunting and intelligence teams for effective threat tracking and response

**Conclusion**
- **Collaboration:** Between malware reverse engineering, threat intelligence, and threat hunting enables effective response
- **Continued Learning:** Sophos continues to refine and improve threat hunting and intelligence practices.
