 As I said, my name is Rachel Giacobazzi.
2.00s - 5.00s |  I'm from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team.
5.00s - 9.00s |  When I was asked to put together the Mystic Year in Review,
9.00s - 12.00s |  I took a look at everything we've published this year,
12.00s - 14.00s |  and it was really overwhelming.
14.00s - 16.00s |  Like, I understand, as an intel analyst,
16.00s - 20.00s |  it can be a lot to try to find what it is that you're supposed to focus on.
20.00s - 24.00s |  I mean, just this week, we published a new blog.
24.00s - 26.00s |  And a lot of people don't know, but this year,
26.00s - 30.00s |  Microsoft tracked over 1,500 threat actors,
30.00s - 36.00s |  and we saw almost a three-time increase in ransomware attacks.
36.00s - 39.00s |  So this year, when I decided to put the brief together,
39.00s - 44.31s |  I really wanted to focus on what our customers loved this year.
44.31s - 47.31s |  So I actually have it broken down into a few different sections.
47.31s - 51.31s |  We're going to go over some trends, some nation-state actors,
51.31s - 55.31s |  financially motivated threats, tools, techniques, and vulnerabilities.
55.31s - 57.31s |  Now, everything I'm going to showcase for you today
57.31s - 63.87s |  actually makes up almost nearly 2 million customer views.
63.87s - 64.87s |  Let's start with our trends.
64.87s - 67.87s |  Now, these trends represent Q3 of this year,
67.87s - 69.87s |  which is July through September.
69.87s - 70.87s |  And during that 90-day period of time,
70.87s - 75.87s |  we took all of the telemetry that we had in our Microsoft Defender products
75.87s - 78.87s |  and combined that with our threat intel analysis
78.87s - 81.87s |  that is happening across all of our research teams
81.87s - 89.94s |  and conducted some pattern recognition to pull out some key items for you guys.
89.94s - 93.94s |  As we look at the threat landscape highlights,
93.94s - 95.94s |  a few things really stood out to us.
95.94s - 98.94s |  First, commodity tools like Goot Loader and Sliver
98.94s - 101.94s |  were still our most prolific tools used by threat actors
101.94s - 103.94s |  during that 90-day period of time,
103.94s - 109.94s |  and they're most commonly used in ransomware operations.
109.94s - 110.94s |  Speaking of ransomware,
110.94s - 115.94s |  Black Basta was still our most prevalent ransomware during that period.
115.94s - 120.94s |  And Iranian-based nation-state actors like Peach Sandstorm and Mint Sandstorm
120.94s - 123.94s |  were our most active.
123.94s - 128.94s |  Also, when we look at post-compromise tools,
128.94s - 131.94s |  legitimate remote monitoring tools or RMM tools
131.94s - 137.94s |  and techniques like Lulbens are still the majority,
137.94s - 139.94s |  are still the key things our threat actors use
139.94s - 144.18s |  in the majority of post-compromise techniques.
144.18s - 149.18s |  We're going to deep dive into some ransomware.
149.18s - 151.18s |  Honestly, throughout the year in all three quarters,
151.18s - 156.18s |  our most prolific ransomware-linked actors remain consistent.
156.18s - 162.18s |  Groups like Storm 0249 and 0464, who are initial access brokers,
162.18s - 166.18s |  remain consistently active throughout the whole year.
166.18s - 168.18s |  And they tend to deploy commodity malware
168.18s - 171.18s |  and then hand off access to ransomware affiliates
171.18s - 174.18s |  who actually deploy the ransomware.
174.18s - 178.18s |  And although we had multiple targeted industries throughout the time period,
178.18s - 183.18s |  we found that government organizations were still our most targeted.
183.18s - 186.18s |  And popular ransomware-as-a-service offerings like Ransom Hub,
186.18s - 192.74s |  which is a leak site, remained extremely popular.
192.74s - 193.74s |  We're going to look at Black Basta,
193.74s - 195.74s |  which was our most popular ransomware during that period,
195.74s - 200.74s |  and Black Basta first appeared in the wild in April of 2022.
200.74s - 201.74s |  Now, Black Basta is a closed offering,
201.74s - 204.74s |  and what that means is that you will not find it openly available
204.74s - 206.74s |  as a ransomware-as-a-service.
206.74s - 212.74s |  It's only available to the affiliates that are inside that small closed group.
212.74s - 215.74s |  What normally happens with a Black Basta infection
215.74s - 221.74s |  is that groups like Storm 0450 will deploy QuackBot
221.74s - 226.74s |  and then follow up with a secondary malware like Cobalt Strike
226.74s - 231.74s |  or SystemVC or Brute Retail to gain initial access.
231.74s - 237.74s |  And then they'll hand off that initial access to groups like 0826 or 0506
237.74s - 241.74s |  who will then deploy Black Basta on the final targeted systems.
241.74s - 243.74s |  Now, this group is known to do double extortion,
243.74s - 247.74s |  which is to inflict maximum damage as quickly as possible.
247.74s - 251.74s |  So, they not only during initial access will start exfiltrating data,
251.74s - 255.74s |  they will then encrypt the data, extort the company for the encryption,
255.74s - 258.74s |  and then threaten to leak the data that they exfiltrated
258.74s - 263.74s |  on a Tor site for a secondary payment.
263.74s - 266.74s |  And we've seen ransomware spread through like SMB
266.74s - 268.74s |  and the use of remote WMI to launch files,
268.74s - 272.74s |  encrypt devices across the network at a faster pace.
272.74s - 276.50s |  Now, we're going to go to everyone's favorite.
276.50s - 279.50s |  We all know you're here for the nation states.
279.50s - 281.50s |  I'm actually going to showcase four nation state actors
281.50s - 283.50s |  that were pretty active this year.
283.50s - 288.50s |  And just for awareness, Microsoft defines a nation state actor
288.50s - 293.50s |  as actors conducting cyber operations on behalf of
293.50s - 296.50s |  or directed by a nation of state line program.
296.50s - 299.50s |  So, there may be things that we can attribute to the location,
299.50s - 301.50s |  but not necessarily attribute to the nation or the state,
301.50s - 307.99s |  and you wouldn't find them here in this list.
307.99s - 308.99s |  We're going to start with Twill Typhoon.
308.99s - 312.99s |  Twill Typhoon is a China-based threat actor that focuses on espionage.
312.99s - 315.99s |  They primarily target government-related organizations
315.99s - 318.99s |  around the world.
318.99s - 322.99s |  And they're known for targeting victims with malware
322.99s - 325.99s |  on removable media or using phishing emails
325.99s - 329.99s |  that contain a malicious link or a malicious attachment.
329.99s - 331.99s |  And they typically deliver remote access trojans
331.99s - 335.99s |  like PlugX or uDisk.
335.99s - 341.53s |  And to maintain persistence, we see them use Windows Scheduled Task.
341.53s - 344.53s |  So, we're going to go through one of their campaigns.
344.53s - 349.53s |  And in May of 2024, we saw Twill Typhoon conducting a spear phishing campaign.
349.53s - 352.53s |  Now, these campaigns contained a .msc file,
352.53s - 355.53s |  which are the files used in the Microsoft Management Console.
355.53s - 358.53s |  Now, legitimate MSC files are used for things like
358.53s - 362.53s |  Event Viewer and Device Manager within Windows.
362.53s - 366.53s |  Here, the MSC files use XML format
366.53s - 368.53s |  and run within the Management Console.
368.53s - 371.53s |  On this screen, you can see an example of the task wizard
371.53s - 372.53s |  within the Management Console.
372.53s - 374.53s |  And if you see in the parameters section,
374.53s - 376.53s |  it's actually the malicious command.
376.53s - 379.53s |  So, when this is run, the malicious command
379.53s - 383.53s |  is automatically run on the victim system.
383.53s - 387.53s |  These spear phishing emails contained hyperlinks to reports
387.53s - 389.53s |  and press releases and other documents
389.53s - 391.53s |  because they targeted government agencies
391.53s - 393.53s |  kind of throughout the world.
393.53s - 398.53s |  And those links eventually led to the download of PlugX.
398.53s - 401.53s |  Again, their favorite remote access trojan.
401.53s - 407.75s |  We're going to move along to Peach Sandstorm.
407.75s - 409.75s |  Peach Sandstorm is an Iranian group.
409.75s - 414.75s |  They are backed by the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
414.75s - 418.75s |  They target satellite communications, oil, gas, and governments,
418.75s - 422.75s |  usually in the United States or the United Arab Emirates.
422.75s - 426.75s |  They like to use password spray as their initial access vector.
426.75s - 431.75s |  And their goal is to facilitate intelligence collection
431.75s - 434.75s |  really to support the Iranian state interests.
434.75s - 441.09s |  So, if we look at a campaign that they did this year,
441.09s - 443.09s |  between April and July of 2024,
443.09s - 445.09s |  we saw Peach Sandstorm conduct
445.09s - 448.09s |  a long-running intelligence gathering operation.
448.09s - 453.09s |  Here, they used LinkedIn and social engineering
453.09s - 457.09s |  to gather intelligence against higher education,
457.09s - 462.40s |  satellite, and defense sectors throughout this campaign.
462.40s - 464.40s |  Once they collected the initial social engineering
464.40s - 465.40s |  and had their targets,
465.40s - 468.40s |  they then conducted password sprays against VPN providers
468.40s - 473.26s |  with a high level of success.
473.26s - 474.26s |  Once they were in,
474.26s - 480.26s |  they downloaded a new custom multistage backdoor named Tickler.
480.26s - 483.26s |  Tickler leverages attacker-controlled Azure subscriptions
483.26s - 485.26s |  for command and control,
485.26s - 487.26s |  and it tends to collect network information from the host
487.26s - 489.26s |  and send it to the CT URL.
489.26s - 491.26s |  We believe that's used for the threat actor
491.26s - 493.26s |  to orient themselves in the network
493.26s - 497.26s |  before laterally moving using SMB or RMM tooling.
497.26s - 504.22s |  Next, we're going to move to Russia,
504.22s - 506.22s |  and we have Star Blizzard.
506.22s - 508.22s |  I know we just put out the blog on Midnight Blizzard,
508.22s - 511.22s |  but I figured we'd give you someone new.
511.22s - 515.22s |  Star Blizzard's main effort is cloud email compromise
515.22s - 518.22s |  for credential theft through spear phishing.
518.22s - 522.22s |  And they've been linked to hack and leak campaigns,
522.22s - 525.22s |  typically motivated by espionage.
525.22s - 529.22s |  And they like to target the UK, the US, Europe, and Ukraine.
529.22s - 537.78s |  Now, the big news on Star Blizzard is that in July of 2024,
537.78s - 539.78s |  they shifted from using attachments in emails
539.78s - 542.78s |  to malicious links in emails,
542.78s - 545.78s |  which I know seems like a huge tactic shift,
545.78s - 547.78s |  but since the beginning,
547.78s - 549.78s |  they've only used attachments in emails,
549.78s - 553.78s |  so this was a huge deviation from every other campaign
553.78s - 556.78s |  that we've seen from them over the years.
556.78s - 560.78s |  And here, their phishing emails are highly personalized,
560.78s - 563.78s |  and they impersonate a trusted sender.
563.78s - 566.78s |  They send an altered OneDrive file share
566.78s - 569.78s |  that contains a clickable link
569.78s - 572.78s |  that ends up on an evil jinx server.
572.78s - 576.78s |  The follow-on activity is always adversary in the middle
576.78s - 579.78s |  to steal session tokens.
579.78s - 582.78s |  Now, this shift between an attachment to a link
582.78s - 586.78s |  actually removes some of the detection opportunities
586.78s - 590.78s |  through traditional phishing detections.
590.78s - 593.78s |  Now, in March of 2024, we actually saw a very similar campaign
593.78s - 595.78s |  that used an attachment instead
595.78s - 598.78s |  that was highly targeted against US think tanks,
598.78s - 600.78s |  and those US think tanks were related to policy
600.78s - 603.78s |  in academic circles.
603.78s - 606.78s |  Here, we don't have as granular of targeting.
606.78s - 610.44s |  Now, both of those cases,
610.44s - 613.44s |  Star Blizzard specifically was doing
613.44s - 615.44s |  an adversary in the middle attack.
615.44s - 618.44s |  So, for those that have not heard this or AITM,
618.44s - 620.44s |  it kind of follows the same pattern
620.44s - 622.44s |  as a man in the middle attack,
622.44s - 624.44s |  but this is using a proxy service.
624.44s - 627.44s |  So, what happens is the victim
627.44s - 631.44s |  will get a spear phishing email that usually contains a link,
631.44s - 633.44s |  and that link will take them
633.44s - 635.44s |  to what looks like a legitimate site,
635.44s - 639.44s |  but is actually a phishing site that is attacker-controlled,
639.44s - 641.44s |  and they'll put in their credentials,
641.44s - 643.44s |  and then the attacker will actually proxy
643.44s - 645.44s |  between that phishing site and the legitimate site,
645.44s - 648.44s |  adding in those legitimate credentials.
648.44s - 650.44s |  Now, a lot of these sites have MFA enabled
650.44s - 653.44s |  or some kind of follow-on authentication enabled,
653.44s - 654.44s |  which is great,
654.44s - 657.44s |  and basically what the threat actor will do
657.44s - 661.44s |  is they will proxy back that MFA request to the victim,
661.44s - 662.44s |  wait for the victim to provide
662.44s - 664.44s |  whatever additional authentication is needed,
664.44s - 669.44s |  and then proxy that again back over to the legitimate website.
669.44s - 672.44s |  This allows the threat actor who is sitting in the middle
672.44s - 675.44s |  to steal the session token at the legitimate website,
675.44s - 678.44s |  and normally what the threat actor sees then
678.44s - 682.44s |  is that they will, or what the victim will see then
682.44s - 685.44s |  is a redirection to a totally legitimate,
685.44s - 689.44s |  oftentimes not related website.
689.44s - 692.44s |  Meanwhile, the threat actor will take that session token
692.44s - 694.44s |  and either use it at a later time
694.44s - 697.44s |  for initial access into whatever system they're targeting,
697.44s - 701.44s |  or we do see them resell those at that access too.
701.44s - 708.98s |  Our last threat actor here for Nation State
708.98s - 711.98s |  that we're going to look at is Moonstone Sleet.
711.98s - 713.98s |  Now, Moonstone Sleet is a North Korean threat actor,
713.98s - 715.98s |  and like a lot of North Korean threat actors,
715.98s - 720.98s |  they primarily target IT services and software companies.
720.98s - 722.98s |  They like to use social engineering
722.98s - 725.98s |  for data exfiltration and financial gain.
725.98s - 727.98s |  Now, the most interesting thing about Moonstone Sleet
727.98s - 732.98s |  is they actually developed a fully functioning game
732.98s - 733.98s |  called The Tank War.
733.98s - 737.98s |  It actually looks pretty good, which I'm kind of sad about.
737.98s - 741.98s |  They then, after developing this game,
741.98s - 744.98s |  sent out highly targeted emails posing as a software developer
744.98s - 750.98s |  looking for investments and development help,
750.98s - 754.98s |  and they post this game as an NFT-enabled play-to-earn game
754.98s - 756.98s |  that's available on Windows, Macs, and Linux.
757.98s - 759.98s |  And it's actually playable from their website.
759.98s - 762.98s |  Unfortunately, it's not just a game.
762.98s - 766.98s |  It actually includes a custom malware loader
766.98s - 768.98s |  that we track as UELOAD,
768.98s - 772.98s |  and that malware loader is used for network and user discovery,
772.98s - 773.98s |  browser data collection,
773.98s - 777.98s |  and access to the LSAS for dumping credentials.
777.98s - 778.98s |  So, unfortunately, it is malicious,
778.98s - 780.98s |  but it does look like a really cool game.
780.98s - 786.86s |  Now, Moonstone Sleet, like some other North Korean actors,
786.86s - 789.86s |  especially this year, we've heard it in the news,
789.86s - 796.86s |  they have a TTP where they will apply for remote software jobs
796.86s - 798.86s |  to infiltrate organizations,
798.86s - 807.86s |  and they use stolen, forged, or rented identities.
807.86s - 809.86s |  I remember when I first heard this, I was like,
809.86s - 811.86s |  oh, wait, but how does that work?
811.86s - 813.86s |  Like, there's a lot of checks that are involved here.
813.86s - 815.86s |  Like, it just doesn't seem like it would be something
815.86s - 818.86s |  that could go unchecked at a company for a long time,
818.86s - 823.86s |  but it's actually a pretty sophisticated operation.
823.86s - 827.86s |  So, once they are hired, they will actually use a proxy
827.86s - 830.86s |  where they will send all of their equipment to a proxy
830.86s - 834.86s |  that is located in whatever location is appropriate for that company.
834.86s - 838.86s |  Then they use RMM tooling and VPN services and proxies
838.86s - 843.86s |  to connect into their legitimate company equipments
843.86s - 847.86s |  from North Korea, and they kind of get away with this
847.86s - 853.86s |  because they try their best to not have to turn on a camera
853.86s - 856.86s |  or not go into meetings, never talk on a phone,
856.86s - 859.86s |  and when they have to, we've seen a few different ways
859.86s - 861.86s |  that they've gotten around this, either by using the proxy
861.86s - 864.86s |  that's sitting in the United States to sit in on their behalf,
864.86s - 868.86s |  or there was some external reporting where they were actually able
868.86s - 873.86s |  to show that they used AI, not only for imaging but for voice,
873.86s - 878.40s |  to pretend to be in that meeting.
878.40s - 881.40s |  Now, it might seem silly, and a lot of people might think,
881.40s - 883.40s |  like, what is the purpose of this?
883.40s - 886.40s |  But the majority of this remote IT worker program
886.40s - 889.40s |  is used for financial gain and extortion of data.
889.40s - 894.40s |  Like, you're going to take data away because you belong to the network.
894.40s - 899.40s |  It's a lot harder for companies to determine that that's exfiltration
899.40s - 908.02s |  versus maybe a data loss prevention program.
908.02s - 911.02s |  All right, next we're going to talk about financially motivated threats,
911.02s - 915.02s |  and I know as an analyst the first thing that comes to my mind is ransomware.
915.02s - 917.02s |  But Microsoft actually tracks more than just ransomware
917.02s - 919.02s |  as financially motivated threats.
919.02s - 923.02s |  So large-scale phishing campaigns whose end purpose is some form
923.02s - 927.02s |  of financial gain, as well as, like, business email compromise,
927.02s - 930.02s |  and, of course, ransomware are all included
930.02s - 932.02s |  in our financially motivated threats.
932.02s - 936.02s |  Although I am going to showcase two ransomware actors,
936.02s - 940.02s |  their TTPs have evolved over the years to be almost as advanced
940.02s - 943.02s |  and prolific as some of our nation state actors.
943.02s - 951.98s |  I'm also going to showcase a phishing as a service campaign that we saw.
951.98s - 953.98s |  So let's start with OctoTempest.
953.98s - 956.98s |  I feel like this is probably our most public
956.98s - 959.98s |  financially motivated threat actor.
959.98s - 962.98s |  OctoTempest targets a variety of industries.
962.98s - 966.98s |  It includes telecom, finance, retail, IT,
966.98s - 970.98s |  and they use a variety of TTPs to navigate the complex hybrid environment
970.98s - 973.98s |  so they can not only navigate on-prem environments,
973.98s - 977.98s |  but cloud and also companies that have hybrid.
977.98s - 980.98s |  And their objectives vary depending on the target.
980.98s - 984.98s |  For example, in May of 2024, we saw OctoTempest target
984.98s - 987.98s |  nuanced communications via SMS phishing
987.98s - 990.98s |  for initial access into that telecom provider.
990.98s - 997.89s |  We've also seen them evolve over the years.
997.89s - 1002.89s |  So in early 2022, Microsoft saw OctoTempest
1002.89s - 1005.89s |  monetize their intrusions for the first time
1005.89s - 1011.89s |  by selling SIM swaps to other criminal groups.
1011.89s - 1014.89s |  And they conducted social engineering and data collection
1014.89s - 1017.89s |  in order to facilitate these swaps.
1017.89s - 1019.89s |  We did see them perform some account takeovers
1019.89s - 1022.89s |  and steal cryptocurrency towards the end of that period.
1022.89s - 1028.89s |  And they sold access to the cryptocurrency to other actors.
1028.89s - 1033.89s |  In late 2022 to early 2023, we saw them change their targeting.
1033.89s - 1037.89s |  So now they're looking at telecommunications, email,
1037.89s - 1042.89s |  and technology organizations, which we still see them target today.
1042.89s - 1045.89s |  They used phishing and social engineering
1045.89s - 1049.89s |  to conduct a mass password reset campaign,
1049.89s - 1054.89s |  targeting customers that allowed them to conduct data exfiltration.
1054.89s - 1057.89s |  And then from mid-2023 to now,
1057.89s - 1059.89s |  we see them expand their targeting again
1059.89s - 1064.89s |  into gaming, hospitality, retail, MSPs, finance, manufacturing.
1064.89s - 1066.89s |  The list could go on.
1066.89s - 1068.89s |  And with that expansion of targeting,
1068.89s - 1070.89s |  they expanded their capabilities by becoming
1070.89s - 1072.89s |  a Black Hat ransomware affiliate,
1072.89s - 1076.89s |  which means that they exclusively use Black Hat ransomware.
1076.89s - 1079.89s |  Now they leverage the data theft and encryption for extortion.
1079.89s - 1081.89s |  They are part of the double extortion ecosystem
1081.89s - 1083.89s |  that exists in ransomware today.
1083.89s - 1091.92s |  Vanilla Tempest is another ransomware actor.
1091.92s - 1093.92s |  They're known to deploy ransomware
1093.92s - 1096.92s |  and conduct that double extortion, just like OctoTempest.
1096.92s - 1101.92s |  But they disproportionately target the U.S. education sector,
1101.92s - 1103.92s |  but we have seen them in this year
1103.92s - 1105.92s |  target U.S. hospitals and local governments,
1105.92s - 1108.92s |  as well as retail organizations.
1108.92s - 1110.92s |  The interesting thing about Vanilla Tempest
1110.92s - 1113.92s |  is that their payload has evolved over the years.
1113.92s - 1116.92s |  They started as a Black Hat ransomware affiliate,
1116.92s - 1120.92s |  then they moved to QuantumLocker, to Zeppelin, Riceta,
1120.92s - 1124.92s |  and now we see them deploying INC ransomware.
1124.92s - 1129.92s |  They also leverage publicly known
1129.92s - 1131.92s |  and disclosed vulnerabilities for initial access
1131.92s - 1135.92s |  and elevation of privilege in their target systems.
1135.92s - 1137.92s |  We've seen them use backdoors,
1137.92s - 1140.92s |  like SystemVC, Porter, and Supper,
1140.92s - 1145.92s |  to establish persistence and create a way for lateral movement
1145.92s - 1150.20s |  during their initial access processes.
1150.20s - 1152.20s |  We're actually going to go through that.
1152.20s - 1155.20s |  This year we saw Vanilla Tempest target hospitals in the U.S.
1155.20s - 1157.20s |  with INC ransomware.
1157.20s - 1162.20s |  In August of 2024, we believe that this ransomware infection
1162.20s - 1165.20s |  started and originated with a bootloader infection
1165.20s - 1169.20s |  that was using search engine optimization poisoning.
1169.20s - 1174.20s |  And while bootloader is a multistage payload distribution malware
1174.20s - 1176.20s |  that's been active since 2018,
1176.20s - 1182.20s |  and Microsoft tracks bootloader infections as storm 0494.
1182.20s - 1186.20s |  So, we believe 0494 did SEO poisoning,
1186.20s - 1188.20s |  had bootloader, compromised the targets,
1188.20s - 1190.20s |  that's the initial access vector.
1190.20s - 1194.20s |  Then they handed over that initial access to Vanilla Tempest.
1194.20s - 1200.20s |  Now, Vanilla Tempest downloaded INC ransomware at U.S. hospitals.
1200.20s - 1202.20s |  After the ransomware was downloaded,
1202.20s - 1207.20s |  they then followed on with Super Backdoor,
1207.20s - 1208.20s |  which was used for discovery,
1208.20s - 1211.20s |  establishing command and control, and exfiltration,
1211.20s - 1215.20s |  as well as the legitimate tool AnyDesk, which is an RMM tool.
1215.20s - 1217.20s |  Here they use that for persistence
1217.20s - 1220.20s |  and to deploy additional malicious tooling
1220.20s - 1223.20s |  so that those tools weren't going directly to disk,
1223.20s - 1228.20s |  instead being using a secondary piece of legitimate tooling for it.
1228.20s - 1229.20s |  And finally, they deployed Mega,
1229.20s - 1233.20s |  which is a data sync tool that they use for exfiltration of data,
1233.20s - 1240.75s |  and they use it to perform lateral movement through RDP.
1240.75s - 1242.75s |  The last thing we're going to go over in the financial space
1242.75s - 1245.75s |  is a large-scale SharePoint campaign,
1245.75s - 1247.75s |  or a SharePoint phishing campaign
1247.75s - 1251.75s |  that was backed by the DatSec Phishing as a Service page.
1251.75s - 1254.75s |  So, in August of 2024, this phishing campaign,
1254.75s - 1258.75s |  which masqueraded as SharePoint document notifications,
1258.75s - 1263.75s |  used the DatSec Phishing as a Service platform
1263.75s - 1266.75s |  to conduct adversary-in-the-middle campaigns.
1266.75s - 1267.75s |  So, there was no malware here.
1267.75s - 1273.75s |  This was just all initial access and stealing of session tokens.
1273.75s - 1277.75s |  They used that Phishing as a Service platform
1277.75s - 1283.75s |  to collect credentials and authentication tokens.
1283.75s - 1287.75s |  This campaign had customized emails from compromised user accounts,
1287.75s - 1290.75s |  and they targeted their victims with customized messages
1290.75s - 1295.61s |  that were themed to their profession.
1295.61s - 1299.61s |  These messages included a fake multi-factor authentication check
1299.61s - 1302.61s |  as well as a CloudFlare capture check,
1302.61s - 1305.61s |  and we believe that both of these checks collected background information
1305.61s - 1311.61s |  as well as provided directors a way to prevent security solutions
1311.61s - 1316.08s |  from detecting that phishing infrastructure.
1316.08s - 1321.08s |  Automation can't detect it if it has to hit the capture first.
1321.08s - 1323.08s |  I guess it does protect against robots.
1323.08s - 1330.63s |  Now, we've seen a lot of tools used by threat actors,
1330.63s - 1332.63s |  and I'm going to highlight two tools.
1332.63s - 1336.63s |  One of the tools is a bespoke piece of malware
1336.63s - 1342.63s |  that was custom developed and only used by a specific set of threat actors,
1342.63s - 1347.63s |  and the other one I'm going to go over is an openly available tool
1347.63s - 1352.63s |  that is used by Office of Security teams, red teams, and pen testing teams
1352.63s - 1356.63s |  currently because it's a legitimate testing platform.
1356.63s - 1359.63s |  We're also going to go through a technique that we saw this year
1359.63s - 1361.63s |  that was used by several threat actors.
1361.63s - 1367.64s |  We're going to start with GooseAche.
1367.64s - 1370.64s |  GooseAche is a bespoke tool used by Forest Blizzard.
1370.64s - 1376.64s |  Forest Blizzard is a Russian nation-state actor that's been active since 2010.
1377.64s - 1383.64s |  Forest Blizzard targets government, energy, transportation in U.S., Europe,
1383.64s - 1387.64s |  the Middle East, and GooseAche exploits a vulnerability,
1387.64s - 1390.64s |  specifically CVE-2022-38028,
1390.64s - 1397.64s |  which is a privilege escalation vulnerability in Windows Print Spooler.
1397.64s - 1402.64s |  Part of the post-compromise activities,
1402.64s - 1409.64s |  or this tool is used as part of post-compromise activities against those targets.
1409.64s - 1413.64s |  While GooseAche is just a simple launcher application,
1413.64s - 1416.64s |  it's capable of spawning other applications
1416.64s - 1418.64s |  with command-line elevated privileges,
1418.64s - 1421.64s |  which means it facilitates things like remote code execution,
1421.64s - 1428.78s |  installing of backdoors, and moving laterally through compromised networks.
1428.78s - 1431.78s |  Now, RowTools is a legitimate recon framework
1431.78s - 1435.78s |  for Microsoft Entra ID environments.
1435.78s - 1439.78s |  It is used by both red teams and pen testing teams,
1439.78s - 1441.78s |  as well as threat actors.
1441.78s - 1443.78s |  And we actually observed Peach Sandstorm and Silk Typhoon,
1443.78s - 1447.78s |  a Chinese nation-state actor, using RowTools.
1447.78s - 1451.78s |  This tool is used after gaining initial authentication into Entra ID.
1451.78s - 1453.78s |  So, the threat actor that uses this tool
1453.78s - 1457.78s |  has to have legitimate credentials first into Entra ID.
1457.78s - 1460.78s |  If it does not give them that access, they have to have that access.
1460.78s - 1465.60s |  The threat actors will pass that token
1465.60s - 1468.60s |  to the RotaryCon module for auth and discovery.
1468.60s - 1470.60s |  And here in our screenshot, we see what comes back.
1470.60s - 1475.60s |  So, this is the information that's returned from the RotaryCon,
1475.60s - 1483.38s |  which can then be used for malicious fall-on activities and lateral movements.
1483.38s - 1485.38s |  Next, we're going to talk about leveraging the clipboard
1485.38s - 1487.38s |  to run malicious PowerShell commands.
1487.38s - 1490.38s |  So, we saw a phishing email
1490.38s - 1492.38s |  that sent users to a page that looked like,
1492.38s - 1495.38s |  hey, something went wrong, we need you to fix it.
1495.38s - 1498.38s |  And it looks like after you click a few pop-ups,
1498.38s - 1500.38s |  you'll be able to fix it.
1500.38s - 1502.38s |  But what actually pops up is what's on the screen here,
1502.38s - 1507.38s |  which is directions for you to copy a PowerShell command,
1507.38s - 1509.38s |  open up PowerShell in Windows,
1509.38s - 1512.38s |  paste that command, and then run it.
1512.38s - 1515.38s |  I thought it was interesting to highlight here
1515.38s - 1519.38s |  because here it's more social engineering than anything malicious
1519.38s - 1521.38s |  in the email because basically the threat actors
1521.38s - 1525.38s |  are just convincing their victims to run their code for them.
1525.38s - 1528.24s |  All right.
1528.24s - 1532.24s |  We're going to go through two vulnerabilities.
1532.24s - 1533.24s |  This is going to be a little fast
1533.24s - 1535.24s |  because vulnerabilities are very tech-heavy,
1535.24s - 1537.24s |  and here I just want to highlight how they're being used.
1537.24s - 1541.24s |  So, 26169 is an Elevation of Privilege vulnerability
1541.24s - 1543.24s |  in Windows Error Report Processing.
1543.24s - 1545.24s |  And this Error Report Processing
1545.24s - 1549.24s |  enables customers to notify Microsoft
1549.24s - 1553.24s |  of application faults and app-specific issues.
1553.24s - 1555.24s |  And any threat actor that exploits this
1555.24s - 1557.24s |  would gain system privileges
1557.24s - 1560.24s |  and could install malicious payloads
1560.24s - 1562.24s |  and gain access to restricted data.
1562.24s - 1563.24s |  And in June of 2024,
1563.24s - 1566.24s |  we saw Black Basta ransomware affiliates
1566.24s - 1571.42s |  use this vulnerability for initial access.
1571.42s - 1574.42s |  7971 is a Type Confusion vulnerability
1574.42s - 1577.42s |  in the V8 JavaScript WebAssembly engine.
1577.42s - 1579.42s |  That's a lot.
1579.42s - 1581.42s |  It affects vulnerable Chromium versions
1581.42s - 1583.42s |  and allows threat actors to gain remote code execution
1583.42s - 1586.42s |  in sandbox Chromium render processes.
1586.42s - 1588.42s |  Here, Microsoft actually saw
1588.42s - 1590.42s |  North Korean threat actor Citrins Lee
1590.42s - 1594.42s |  exploiting this vulnerability in August of 2024.
1594.42s - 1595.42s |  And after exploitation,
1595.42s - 1599.70s |  they downloaded the FUD Module Rootkit.
1599.70s - 1601.70s |  Now, the FUD Module Rootkit
1601.70s - 1604.70s |  is a rootkit that establishes kernel-level access
1604.70s - 1607.70s |  while evading detection.
1607.70s - 1608.70s |  It was developed in 2021
1608.70s - 1611.70s |  and has used other vulnerabilities before.
1611.70s - 1614.70s |  It is an exclusive North Korean tool
1614.70s - 1616.70s |  originally used by DiamondSleet,
1616.70s - 1618.70s |  but in August of 2024,
1618.70s - 1620.70s |  we saw Citrins Lee start to use it.
1620.70s - 1622.70s |  It employs DKOM techniques
1622.70s - 1625.70s |  to disrupt kernel-level mechanisms
1625.70s - 1627.70s |  and performs kernel tampering
1627.70s - 1630.70s |  that allows for read-write access to the kernel.
1630.70s - 1633.94s |  All right.
1633.94s - 1635.94s |  So, we've gone through all of the threats,
1635.94s - 1637.94s |  but all is not lost.
1637.94s - 1639.94s |  We're going to go through some high-level things
1639.94s - 1640.94s |  that everybody can do
1640.94s - 1642.94s |  to protect themselves from these threats.
1642.94s - 1645.94s |  And it's going to start with user education.
1645.94s - 1647.94s |  I know as professionals,
1647.94s - 1649.94s |  sometimes user education feels redundant,
1649.94s - 1651.94s |  but it really is one of the best ways
1651.94s - 1653.94s |  of preventing phishing and social engineering.
1653.94s - 1656.94s |  Your company should not only teach users
1656.94s - 1658.94s |  how to recognize phishing emails
1658.94s - 1661.94s |  and how to identify and report malware infections,
1661.94s - 1663.94s |  but they should also understand
1663.94s - 1666.94s |  and recognize when there is unsolicited communications,
1666.94s - 1669.94s |  like phishing and smishing,
1669.94s - 1672.94s |  as well as being careful about what they share online,
1672.94s - 1675.94s |  both personal and business.
1675.94s - 1678.94s |  In addition to user education,
1678.94s - 1681.94s |  things like phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication,
1681.94s - 1684.94s |  such as Microsoft Authenticator or FIDO2,
1684.94s - 1687.94s |  security keys or certificate-based authentication
1687.94s - 1690.94s |  is a great secondary method for protecting here.
1690.94s - 1692.94s |  And both of those should be combined
1692.94s - 1695.94s |  with risk-based user policies
1695.94s - 1698.94s |  as well as continuous monitoring
1698.94s - 1700.94s |  for suspicious and anomalous activities.
1700.94s - 1705.58s |  We can defend against a lot of common malware techniques.
1705.58s - 1708.58s |  First, by protecting the entry vectors, right?
1708.58s - 1709.58s |  You should block Office applications
1709.58s - 1711.58s |  from doing things like creating child processes
1711.58s - 1713.58s |  and executing content and injecting code
1713.58s - 1715.58s |  and maybe you shouldn't have macros enabled
1715.58s - 1718.58s |  and you should block execution of Office JScript
1718.58s - 1721.58s |  and JavaScript that wants to execute additional content.
1721.58s - 1723.58s |  And there's a lot here,
1723.58s - 1724.58s |  but a lot of these are things
1724.58s - 1726.58s |  that a lot of the security products already do.
1726.58s - 1728.58s |  You just have to turn it on.
1728.58s - 1730.58s |  And then for lateral movement,
1730.58s - 1732.58s |  you should not allow any executable files
1732.58s - 1735.58s |  running in your environment unless you trust them.
1735.58s - 1739.58s |  There should be some form of prevalence, age,
1739.58s - 1741.58s |  or trust list involved
1741.58s - 1744.58s |  for those files to run in your environment.
1744.58s - 1750.23s |  When we look at data exfiltration,
1750.23s - 1753.23s |  there are two products that can really help here.
1753.23s - 1754.23s |  First, the Next Generation Firewall
1754.23s - 1757.23s |  that is not only looking at things that are IOC-based
1757.23s - 1758.23s |  but actually providing
1758.23s - 1761.23s |  signature-based intrusion detection.
1761.23s - 1765.23s |  Looking for specific patterns in telemetry.
1765.23s - 1769.23s |  So, not something that's going to be easily circumvented.
1769.23s - 1771.23s |  And then we want a Cloud Access Security Broker.
1771.23s - 1774.23s |  Now, these prevent data downloads,
1774.23s - 1776.23s |  set rules that enforce data
1776.23s - 1778.23s |  to be encrypted in the cloud environment,
1778.23s - 1780.23s |  control risky IP addresses
1780.23s - 1784.23s |  from connecting directly into your data.
1784.23s - 1787.23s |  And in addition to these products,
1787.23s - 1790.23s |  you should also have robust user access policies
1790.23s - 1793.23s |  and data classification and handling policies.
1793.23s - 1795.23s |  And of course, I want to be at Microsoft
1795.23s - 1800.23s |  if I didn't talk about Secure Future Initiative.
1800.23s - 1802.23s |  Really, 90% of the things we talk about
1802.23s - 1804.23s |  can really be prevented
1804.23s - 1807.23s |  with the ideas behind Secure Future Initiative or SFI.
1807.23s - 1809.23s |  First, secure by design.
1809.23s - 1812.23s |  Security should happen at the design phase.
1812.23s - 1814.23s |  You should have secure development life cycles.
1814.23s - 1817.23s |  And if your engineers do not know how to do that,
1817.23s - 1819.23s |  you should be providing specialized training
1819.23s - 1821.23s |  on secure coding practices.
1821.23s - 1824.28s |  Secure by default.
1824.28s - 1825.28s |  You should be shipping products
1825.28s - 1828.28s |  that have all the security mechanisms turned on.
1828.28s - 1831.28s |  I understand there's ease of use here
1831.28s - 1834.28s |  and some of these issues here with user interactions
1834.28s - 1835.28s |  and the user experience.
1835.28s - 1837.28s |  But honestly, you should ship
1837.28s - 1839.28s |  with all the security mechanisms turned off
1839.28s - 1843.28s |  and then leave the onus to the end user to turn those off.
1843.28s - 1844.28s |  As a company providing that product,
1844.28s - 1848.28s |  you should not be turning that off automatically.
1848.28s - 1850.28s |  And of course, security operations.
1850.28s - 1851.28s |  This is a cybersecurity conference.
1851.28s - 1854.28s |  A lot of us work in the operations that are here.
1854.28s - 1857.28s |  You want to have operations and controls
1857.28s - 1859.28s |  and monitoring to detect, mitigate,
1859.28s - 1861.28s |  and respond to cyber threats.
1861.28s - 1862.28s |  I'm out of time,
1862.28s - 1863.28s |  but the last thing I'm going to leave you with
1863.28s - 1865.28s |  is that a lot of this content in our briefing
1865.28s - 1866.28s |  is available in the product
1866.28s - 1868.28s |  if you have Defender Threat Intelligence
1868.28s - 1869.28s |  or Threat Analytics.
1869.28s - 1871.28s |  And for everybody that doesn't have our product,
1871.28s - 1874.28s |  a portion of this is available on our public blog,
1874.28s - 1877.28s |  which is the Microsoft Threat Intelligence blog.
1877.28s - 1878.28s |  Thank you.
