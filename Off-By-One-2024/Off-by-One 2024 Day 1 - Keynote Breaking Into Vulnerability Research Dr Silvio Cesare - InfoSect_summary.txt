**Introduction**
- Dr. Silvio Cesare is the founder and director of InfoSect, a vulnerability research company.
- The talk focuses on the challenges of building and running a successful VR company.

**Challenges of Vulnerability Research**
- **Defining Vulnerability Research:** Distinguishing VR from pentesting or code auditing, focusing on discovering and exploiting zero-days in ubiquitous targets like OS kernels, browsers, and embedded devices.
- **Relevant Targets:** Emphasizing the importance of targeting widely-used software with default configurations to ensure the impact of vulnerability research.
- **Transitioning to VR:** Dr. Cesare's journey from hobbyist bug hunting to professional VR, highlighting the need for domain-specific knowledge and target-specific bug-hunting strategies.

**Building a VR Company**
- **Founding Team:** The importance of having generalist specialists as founders, with a mix of business, technical, and sales skills.
- **Hiring:**
   - Challenges of hiring in VR, including the decision between senior and junior researchers.
   - Sources of talent: CTF players, university graduates, pen testers, software developers, forensics specialists, and electronic engineers.
   - The value of a trial process to assess candidates' skills and fit with the team culture.
- **Target Selection:** Starting with realistic targets based on the founding team's specialties and expanding as the company grows, emphasizing depth and specialization over breadth.

**Team Culture and Collaboration**
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Encouraging a collaborative team culture through internal documentation, presentations, and a comfortable environment for asking and receiving help.
- **Confidence Building:** The role of founders and senior researchers in building confidence among juniors by demonstrating their own confidence and providing meaningful tasks with real impact.
- **Regular Outputs:** The need for consistent and impactful research outputs to maintain team morale and customer relationships.

**Engineering and Exploit Development**
- **Engineering Support:** The role of engineering in VR, including the development of tools and automation to support research efforts.
- **Exploit Reliability:** Striving for 100% reliability, avoiding long runtimes and version-specific ROP chains.
- **Technical Glass Ceiling:** VR offers continuous learning and impact, with proportional salary increases and bonuses, unlike traditional tech jobs.

**Infrastructure and Costs**
- **Complex Infrastructure:** The need for specialized infrastructure, including on-premises networks, lab equipment, and embedded device analysis tools.
- **Hiring Challenges:** Finding good infrastructure specialists who understand the unique requirements of a VR company.

**Q&A Session**
- **EEs in VR:** The increasing popularity of embedded systems and the importance of hiring engineers who can work with firmware and hardware.
- **Consistent Output:** Monitoring researchers' daily progress and providing feedback to ensure consistent output and manage uncertainty.
- **Disclosure Debate:** Navigating the complexities of vulnerability disclosure and NDAs with target companies.
- **Staff Retention:** Creating a positive culture, paying competitively, and fostering a sense of community to retain key talent.
- **University Education:** The applicability of university cybersecurity courses to VR, and the value of internships for both employers and interns.
- **Age Limit:** The tendency for older hackers to move into management roles, but the satisfaction of remaining hands-on with code and research.
- **Skill Shortage:** Encouraging juniors to enter VR through initiatives like CTFs, university collaborations, and internships.
- **Exotic Targets:** A lighthearted discussion about challenging targets faced by the speaker.
