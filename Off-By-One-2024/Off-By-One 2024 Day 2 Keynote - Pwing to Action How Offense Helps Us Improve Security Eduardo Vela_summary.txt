**Introduction:**
- Eduardo works in the Information Security Engineering team at Google.
- His work involves making Google products safer, with a recent focus on CPU and Firefox.
- The discussion will center on how Google approaches security for their products and open-source hardware dependencies.

**Goal:**
- To explore how keeping exploit information secret makes **offense** cheaper and **defense** more expensive.
- Google aims to reverse this trend by engaging with the security community and sharing knowledge.

**Information Asymmetry Example:**
- **Scenario:** Four cars are for sale, one of which has hidden problems.
- **Price Variation:** The seller of the problematic car can ask for a higher price because buyers lack information about the car's issues.
- **Market Collapse:** As more sellers with faulty cars enter the market, the average price drops, discouraging honest sellers.

**Reacting to Security Problems:**
- Treating security issues as **emergencies** leads to higher costs and negative impacts on reputation and products.
- A better approach is to view security as a **medical problem**, focusing on prevention and long-term solutions.
- This involves adopting secure practices, languages, and verifiable legal systems, which can be challenging and time-consuming.

**Developer Considerations:**
- Developers must balance multiple factors: development time, feature maintenance, latency, bugs, performance, and capacity.
- Implementing additional security measures adds to these complexities and costs.

**Technical Example:**
- A simple bug in a code snippet is identified, involving a **use-after-free** vulnerability.
- A potential fix is suggested, but it would lead to memory issues if used repeatedly.
- The question arises: Is it worth fixing this type of bug?

**Calculating the Worth of Fixes:**
- One approach is to examine the costs of responding to incidents, such as lost sales or partnerships.
- By comparing the hypothetical maximum spend, actual spend, and potential spend with security obligations, organizations can assess the impact of different security measures.
- This data can inform decisions about investing in specific mitigations.

**Chrome Security Team Example:**
- The team compares the effectiveness of disabling JIT compilation and V8 sandbox escape mitigations.
- By analyzing data from V8's bug bounty program and Pwn2Own, they gain insights into the prevalence of different exploit types.
- This information guides their investment decisions and defense strategies.

**The Offensive Landscape:**
- Technology's pervasive influence has led to a diverse range of actors, including law enforcement, intelligence agencies, military, cybercriminals, and more.
- The demand for offensive capabilities has increased competition and driven up costs.

**The Defender's Challenge:**
- Defenders need as much information as offenders to mount an effective defense, but the supply of information is limited and expensive.
- Increasing transparency and sharing solutions can attract offenders to use specific techniques, allowing defenders to quantify their mitigations.

**The Role of Artificial Intelligence:**
- AI can be a tool for both offense and defense, but its impact depends on how it's used and the availability of data.
- Increasing transparency and attracting more researchers can help level the playing field.

**The KernelCTF Impact:**
- Google's KernelCTF has significantly increased the number of public kernel exploits, providing valuable data for defense strategies.
- The long-term goal is to make offense less profitable and defense more accessible and effective.

**Conclusion:**
- Transparency empowers buyers to demand better products and enables defenders to quantify their mitigations.
- By increasing the cost of offense and lowering the cost of defense, we can improve overall security.
- Google's efforts, like KernelCTF, aim to disrupt the offensive market and encourage collaboration.
