**Introduction:**
- Presented by **Zack Allen**, Senior Director of Security Detection Research at **Datadog**.
- Talk covers:
    - Buzzword bingo on **cloud service providers**
    - How Datadog models **cloud threats** for detection
    - Case studies on:
        - Using the cloud for external attacks
        - Cloud as the primary target

**Understanding Hyperscalers:**
- **Hyperscalers** include **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP**, according to **Wall Street**.
- These companies offer **hundreds of services** for developers, creating a **homogenous environment**.
- **Shared responsibility model**:
    - Cloud providers and users share responsibility for securing different aspects of the environment.
    - This model creates an **information asymmetry**, which cybercriminals exploit.

**Describing Cloud Service Attacks:**
- Datadog focuses on answering **where, what, who, and how** questions to precisely describe cloud service attacks.
- **Where**: Identifying the specific location of the attack within the **cloud, cluster, container, or code**.
- **What**: Analyzing **data on the wire**, including **control plane** and **data plane** information.
- **Who**: Determining if the actor is a **bot or human** by baselining identity and access management behavior.
- **How**: Utilizing **MITRE ATT&CK Cloud** to understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in cloud attacks.

**Case Studies:**
- **Resource Hijacking Attack**:
    - Threat actor used stolen **AWS keys** to access victim environments and send **SMS-based phishing** messages.
    - Detection opportunity: Spikes in data plane events and associated phishing websites.
    - Initial access: Scanning for **misconfigured code repos** and **environment files** containing access keys.
- **Developer Targeting**:
    - Compromising popular **Python** and **PHP** packages to shim in malware and steal **AWS access keys**.
    - Detection opportunity: Monitoring package registries (e.g., **PyPI**) for malicious code uploads.
    - Initial access: Phishing kits targeting developers, leveraging compromised packages to gain access.
- **Cloud as Primary Target**:
    - **Scattered Spider** and **Muddled Libra**: Groups targeting cloud environments for **intellectual property** and **secrets**.
    - **Exfiltration** is a key focus, moving away from double extortion.
    - **Sisense breach**: Exploiting a misconfigured **GitLab server** to access source code and AWS keys, potentially pivoting to customer environments.
    - **Team TNT**: Group targeting cloud-native technologies like **Kubernetes** and **Docker**.
    - Leaked **tooling** and **hands-on keyboard activity** suggest **Hildegard**, the main actor, is still active.

**Conclusion:**
- Cloud environments are complex and require a nuanced understanding of the various components for effective security.
- Threat actors are increasingly targeting the cloud, adapting their TTPs, and focusing on exfiltration.
- Detection and response strategies must evolve to address these evolving threats.
