**Introduction:**
- Selena Larson, a **senior threat intelligence analyst** at **Proofpoint**, presents at **SLEUTHCON 2024** in **Arlington, VA**.
- The talk centers on the rise of **e-crime** and its increasing sophistication, posing a significant threat to organizations and critical infrastructure.

**The Bias Towards APTs:**
- The **cybersecurity industry's** focus is often biased towards **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)** and **state-backed hackers**, while **e-crime** is relatively overlooked.
- This bias is influenced by the backgrounds of many industry professionals, who come from **government and national security** sectors, bringing their focus on **state-sponsored threats**.
- However, **e-crime** poses a greater threat to the average organization and can have more direct and severe impacts on people's lives and communities.

**A Brief History of Cyber Crime:**
- Early 2000s: Focus on **consumer-facing ransomware** and **malware**.
- Mid-2000s: Rise of **banking Trojans** (e.g., **Zeus**, **Gozi**), targeting personal and business financial data.
- 2009: Introduction of **Bitcoin**, facilitating **crypto-based ransomware** and reducing the need for money mules.
- 2014-2016: Emergence of notorious **botnets** like **Emotet** and **Tridex**, initially as bankers, then pivoting to **ransomware loaders**.
- 2017: **WannaCry** ransomware attack by a **DPRK Threat Actor**, demonstrating the potential for disruptive ransomware.
- 2018: Rise of **big game hunting** with **Reuke** as the gold standard.
- 2019-2020: Introduction of **double extortion**, stealing and leaking data in addition to encryption.
- 2021: **Colonial Pipeline** ransomware attack brings attention to the threat of ransomware on critical infrastructure.
- 2022: **Conti leaks** expose the inner workings and relationships within the cybercriminal ecosystem, leading to the creation of new threat actors and shifting alliances.
- Present: Increased **sophistication** across the landscape, with initial access brokers utilizing **zero-days**, expanding **TTPs**, and targeting **edge network devices**.

**The Sophistication of E-Crime:**
- **E-crime** actors, particularly initial access brokers, have resources to test **TTPs** on thousands of targets daily, forcing defenders to constantly adapt.
- They embrace a "move fast and break things" mentality, with dynamic development cycles, A/B testing, and iterating at scale.
- **E-crime** has the financial means to develop or acquire **novel exploits**, outpacing some **government or espionage groups**.
- They exhibit **persistence** by repeatedly targeting the same organizations, adapting their tactics, and leveraging their financial and technical resources to overcome disruptions.

**The Human Impact of E-Crime:**
- **Ransomware** attacks have led to hospitals closing, job losses, and disruptions in critical industries like manufacturing and logistics, with a significant economic impact.
- Schools and educational institutions have also been affected, disrupting children's education.
- Personal anecdote: The presenter's sister, a healthcare worker, has been impacted by ransomware multiple times, causing stress and frustration in her work and daily life.

**The Blurring Lines Between E-Crime and APTs:**
- **E-crime** actors are adopting sophisticated techniques, blurring the lines between criminal and intelligence agency operations.
- They are using similar **tools and techniques** as **APTs**, and their disruptions can have immediate and significant impacts on both organizations and individuals.
- By focusing primarily on **APTs**, the industry may have missed opportunities to disrupt **e-crime** and contributed to its strength.

**Why It Matters:**
- The **cool factor** associated with **APTs** influences decision-makers and researchers, leading to a bias in attention and resource allocation.
- Words matter: How we communicate threats shapes how organizations, law enforcement, and defenders prioritize and respond to them.
- Reframing **APTs** and shifting the focus to risk and impact can help bridge the gap between **e-crime** and **APTs**, ensuring a more balanced approach to cybersecurity threats.
