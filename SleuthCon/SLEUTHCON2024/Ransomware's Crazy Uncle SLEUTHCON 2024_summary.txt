**Introduction:**
- Presented by **Azim Khodjbaev**, a senior threat intelligence analyst from **Cisco Talos**.
- The talk centers on a notorious cybercriminal known as **"Dziadka/Dydka"** or **"Uncle"**, and their involvement in various ransomware groups and attacks.

**Background of "Uncle":**
- **Native Russian speaker** with strong coding skills, particularly in **Python, C++, and Java**.
- Started with video games, cheating, and forum discussions, eventually developing obfuscators and encrypting payloads.
- Self-taught, they refined their skills and ventured into creating info-stealers and then ransomware.
- Born in the **early 2000s** in **Russia**, with a typical upbringing during a stable political and economic period.
- Has a **lavish lifestyle** fueled by ransomware earnings, including frequent parties, expensive meals, and recreational drug use, with a preference for **ecstasy**.
- Claims to have **tricked "Baster Lord" into donating for healthcare** by pretending to have stage four cancer.
- Accused the presenter of being part of **Conti** and targeted them in a leak.
- May have been involved in **turning off a hospital's life support system during an attack**.
- A **tough negotiator** who takes things personally and has a **vindictive nature**.
- Relies on **psychic tarot readers** for decision-making, influenced by their mother's superstitions.

**Involvement in Ransomware Groups:**
- Confirmed involvement in multiple ransomware families: **Conti, Black Matter, Donut, LockBit, Avos, Goga, SunCrypt, and Hive**.
- Created and ran **Babuk and Monty ransomware**.
- Collaborated with **"Wazawaka"** and **"Khajiit"** to undermine **Black Matter**.
- Had a fall-out with **LockBit** over money and ego issues.
- **Monty was created in April 2023**, based on **Conti's source code**.

**Babuk and Monty Ransomware:**
- **Babuk**: Predominantly created by "Uncle," with modifications to encryption algorithms and enhanced obfuscation.
- Targeted the **DC Metropolitan Police Department**, causing significant disruptions and leading to the leak of Babuk's source code to muddy the waters and avoid attribution.
- **Monty**: Created after the Conti leaks, with a version modification.

**Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):**
- Loves targeting **ESXi hosts and Linux servers**.
- Focuses on **zero-days and proof-of-concepts for VPN providers and platforms**.
- Has dedicated usernames for significant attacks, including **Fortnit and SonicWall**.
- Targets **Cisco** due to its prevalence and known zero-days.
- Immediately encrypts data upon intrusion and applies pressure on victims through constant contact and social engineering.
- Targets **municipalities, governments, schools, and hospitals**, knowing the pressure to restore services is high and backups may be lacking.
- Emphasizes the value of **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**, especially regarding children and healthcare patients.

**Relationship with "Wazawaka":**
- A **hot-and-cold relationship** marked by emotional immaturity, manipulation, and backstabbing.
- Worked together on various projects, including the creation of a ransomware malware platform forum called **GRAMP**.
- **"Wazawaka" allegedly locked "Uncle" out of the forum**.
- **"Uncle" introduced "Wazawaka" to recreational drugs**, particularly ecstasy, to address their body image issues.
- Plotted to physically harm the presenter, demonstrating their vindictive nature.
- **"Uncle's" wallet contains approximately $1 million** in Bitcoin and Ethereum, with sophisticated crypto practices, including NFT transactions and swaps.

**Mitigation and Countermeasures:**
- Stay vigilant against **zero-day vulnerabilities** and **proof-of-concepts**.
- Understand their **targeting preferences**, including virtual environments, municipalities, and PII-rich organizations.
- Strengthen **backup strategies** and **data protection measures** to reduce the impact of potential attacks.
- **Publish information exposing their untrustworthiness** to sow distrust within the ransomware community.

**Conclusion:**
- "Uncle" and "Wazawaka" continue to cause disruption and panic in the ransomware ecosystem, with their actions leading to splintering and the rise of new ransomware groups.
- Law enforcement and private partnerships are expected to grow stronger, with increased budgets and improved interdiction capabilities.
- Infighting within ransomware groups is anticipated, providing opportunities for further disruption and intelligence gathering.
