**Introduction:**
- Presenter is a **threat analyst** on the **financial crime team** at **Mandiant**.
- Topic of discussion: **Cryptors**, a group of malware used by cybercriminals to keep their payloads **undetected**.

**What is a Crypter?:**
- A **builder** that takes a **malware payload** as input, modifies it with **obfuscation** and **encryption** mechanisms, and outputs a **cryptid payload**.
- Cryptid payloads consist of a **stub** and an **embedded payload**.
- Mandiant tracks these as **droppers**.
- Focus is on **publicly available cryptors**, not commercially available services.

**Where to Get a Crypter?:**
- Available on **underground forums**, with significant longevity compared to other tools/services.
- Ads for crypters have been found as far back as **2006**.
- One prominent example, **VIP Crypt**, has been active for **13 years**.

**Crypter Business Models:**
- Fall into two main categories: **self-service** and **managed**.
- In self-service, customers get access to the builder and can encrypt payloads themselves.
- In managed, the service provider encrypts the customer's malware and sends it back.

**Pricing Factors:**
- **Availability of the stub**: Private vs. Public.
- **Timeframe of subscription**.
- Inclusion of **premium offers**.

**Malware Encrypted by Crypters:**
- Analysis of four major public crypters revealed that over **40%** of encrypted malware samples were **information stealers**.
- Interestingly, **25%** of the payloads were **ransomware**, mostly from the **Stop ransomware** family (**Deja Vu**).
- The use of crypters ensures these payloads remain undetected when distributed via **SEO poisoning**.

**Using Crypters for Analysis:**
- Identifying whether a crypter is **publicly or privately available** is crucial for **attribution**.
- Public crypters are advertised on forums and used by various actors, making them less significant for attribution.
- Private crypters are used by specific threat clusters or groups, suggesting **relationships between actors** and aiding attribution.
- Mapping crypted payloads to specific advertisements can be challenging but is aided by **publicly available tools** and **research**.

**Example: Storm Shadow:**
- A recently discovered **Rust-based credential stealer**.
- Earliest versions appeared in **May 2023**, mostly using a **publicly available crypter** (**VIP Crypt**, or **Longfall**).
- In **July 2023**, a brief shift to another public crypter, **MassCrypt** (**Bad Mood**), was observed.
- In **March 2024**, a transition to a suspected **private crypter**, **DryRotv2**, was detected, along with more **sophisticated distribution techniques**.
- This suggested a potential partnership between the Storm Shadow actor and actors with access to DryRotv2 and advanced distribution methods.
- Analysis was facilitated by tracking and identifying the crypters used and understanding their availability.

**Conclusion:**
- Understanding crypters and their usage provides valuable insights into threat activity and can enhance attribution and analysis.
- Special thanks to a **teammate** whose technical expertise enabled granular tracking of crypters.
