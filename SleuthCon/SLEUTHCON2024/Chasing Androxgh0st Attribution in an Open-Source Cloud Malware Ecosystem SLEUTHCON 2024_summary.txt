**Androxgh0st: An Open-Source Malware**
- Androxgh0st is a **Python-based** **malware** discovered on **GitHub** in **2020**.
- It parses **web server environment files** for **secrets**, used by **cloud info stealers** like AlienFox, FBot, and Predator.
- Despite **cybercriminals'** attempts to hide their tools, the **source code** is distributed on **open-source platforms**.

**Introduction and Overview**
- Presented by **Alex Delamotte**, a **threat researcher** at **Sentinel Labs**.
- Delamotte discusses **attribution** in an **open-source malware ecosystem** and explores how **actors** trademark and distribute tools.
- She also delves into the **balance** between **marketing** and **anonymity** for **actors**.

**What is Androx Ghost?**
- Androx Ghost is **Python code** that **scrapes environment and config files** for **secrets**, using **regular expressions**.
- It targets **web servers** using the **Laravel PHP framework** and has a **comorbidity** with **WordPress**.
- The earliest reference is from **December 2020**, with **activity** in **2022** and beyond.

**How is it Used?**
- Androx Ghost is rolled into **Python tools** and **malware families**, targeting the **cloud**.
- It performs **credential harvesting** and is used for **spamming attacks** or **selling sensitive information**.
- It also **locks out** users from their web servers to **hinder incident response** and **establish persistence**.

**Targeted Technologies**
- Androx Ghost targets a range of **cloud service providers** and **email services**, with a focus on **spamming**.
- It also targets some **SMS services** and **content management frameworks** like Drupal and Prestashop.

**Origins of Androx Ghost**
- Variable names in the code are often in **Indonesian** or other **regional languages** like **Bahasa** or **Malay**.
- There is a **nexus** between **cloud tools** and **Indonesia**, with multiple reports of **crypto mining attacks** originating from Indonesian IP addresses.

**Attributing the Tools**
- Actors often include a **contact method** and their **handle** or **distribution channel** within the tool.
- These handles are often **recycled across platforms** and can be found on **Telegram**, **TikTok**, **Twitter**, and **YouTube**.

**Alien Fox Cloud Info Stealer**
- Alien Fox is a **multi-purpose cloud attack tool** with a focus on **spamming** and **cryptocurrency wallet takeover**.
- There are numerous **handles** associated with this tool, and **actors** frequently **cycle through** or **rebrand** them.
- Handles may be abandoned due to **increased attention** or used for an **exit scam**.
- The tool is maintained by an actor with the handle **Jaguar**, who advertises on **Telegram** and **Snapchat**.
- Indicators suggest the actor is based in **Western Africa**, likely **Nigeria**, based on **pop culture references** and **accent analysis**.

**FBOT: A Multi-Purpose Cloud Attack Tool**
- FBOT runs on **infrastructure hosted** by the developer, unlike other cloud attack tools that use API calls to identify vulnerable websites.
- It shares code with the **Legion Info Stealer** and uses a **Lithuanian fashion designer's website** to **validate PayPal accounts**.
- FBOT is Indonesia-centric, and the known samples contain references to **idevexploit.io**.

**Who Made FBOT?**
- The core code contains references to **idevexploit.io**, indicating a possible connection to older malware families.
- The current maintainer uses the handle **rep** or **callmerep**, with associations to the **Indonesian Darknet Telegram group**.
- Rep's website is down, but their **GitHub account** indicates they work at **Google**, are based in **Russia**, and identify as a **hacktivist**.

**Rep's GitHub Connections**
- A removed commit on GitHub included social handles, including a **Facebook account** created in **2018** but inactive until **December 2022**.
- The Facebook account is used to market tools, and GitHub references a handle called **Replicant**, linking to an **Indonesia-based high school CTF team**.

**Who Maintains FBOT?**
- The handle "call me rep" is associated with a **TikTok account** featuring a young woman with no speaking, only captions.
- Videos suggest a possible **breakup** or **difficult past**, with references to dark stories and mafia movies.
- The actor also has a **YouTube channel** used to distribute and advertise their tools, indicating they are likely based in **Indonesia**.

**Predator: A Cloud Info Stealer with AI and GUI**
- Predator has integrated **chat GPT-powered user help mode** and multiple unique handles, making attribution challenging.
- It is related to the **Gray Hat Hackers** Telegram group, adminned by **MR0X01**, who is also referenced in the tool.
- A **GitHub handle** (L4GTR4) leads to a **Twitter account** with posts about **bug bounty** and a location of **Meknes, Morocco**.

**Predator Developer**
- The developer's **profile** and **posts** are in **Arabic**, with a niche language choice of **Moroccan Arabic** in the tool.
- Their **Twitter account** contains political posts, condemning **Western countries** and supporting **Hamas**.
- The developer is likely based in **Morocco**, possibly Meknes, and their **sloppy OPSEC** may lead to further identification.

**Outlook and Conclusion**
- Cloud tools offer a unique window into the world of cybercriminals due to their open-source nature.
- Actors are incentivized to **sell their tools** and may have **lower OPSEC standards** compared to other cybercriminals.
- Most actors are based in **developing countries**, and local law enforcement involvement could impact their operations.
- Cloud attack tool developers often **burn and rotate channels/handles**, making attribution challenging.
- A reminder to **document research** and **develop solutions** as the services relied on by threat intelligence professionals are disappearing.
