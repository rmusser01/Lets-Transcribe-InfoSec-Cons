**Introduction**:
- Presentation by **Eric Loui**, a **Principal Intelligence Analyst** from **CrowdStrike**, at **Sleuthcon 2024** in **Arlington, VA**.
- Focuses on the **increase in threat actors** using **Remote Management and Monitoring (RMM)** tools while **evading security controls**.
- Discusses **case studies**, **popular RMM tools**, and provides **recommendations** for **detection and mitigation**.

**Background on RMM Tools**:
- **Legitimate remote administration software** offered by **commercial vendors**.
- Used by **IT teams, MSSPs** for **monitoring endpoints**, **deploying patches**, and **troubleshooting**.
- **Free versions** available from **multiple vendors**, including **common** and **obscure options**.
- **Key advantages**: remote administration, **free access**, and **evasion of security software** due to **legitimate enterprise use**.
- **Falcon Overwatch telemetry** shows a **near doubling of incidents** involving RMM tools in **2023** compared to **2022**, with a further **increase in 2024**.

**Case Studies**:
- **Scattered Spider**: Aggressive adversary known for **phishing campaigns** and **defeating MFA**.
  - Frequently drops a **variety of RMM tools**, including **uncommon options**.
  - Compromises **admin panels of legitimate EDR tools** to exploit native **remote shell capability**.
  - May also use **web browsers** to access vendor websites and download installers.
  - Deploys RMM tools using **Microsoft Azure run commands** and **Intune**.
- **Chef Spider**: Lower-volume adversary using a **targeted approach**.
  - Contacts companies via **public sales leads or contact forms**, pretending to be a **potential customer**.
  - Sends an **email with a link to a page hosting an installer** for **Screen Connect** (both **Windows** and **macOS** installers observed).
- **Callback Phishing Campaigns**:
  - Adversaries send **emails with imminent charges** for services and a **customer service phone number**.
  - When **contacted**, operators send a **second email** with a link to an **RMM tool** (**Zoho Assist** observed).
  - Used to **download additional RMM tools** (**Super Ops**) and **utilities** (**WinSCP**) for potential **data exfiltration**.

**Hunting Recommendations**:
- **Monitor for typical artifacts** of RMM tools, including **default installer or client names** and **file paths**.
  - Example: AnyDesk writes a file called **GCAPI.dll**, but **other binaries dropped** should be investigated.
- **Network perspective**: Some RMM tools send **DNS requests** to **vendor-associated domains**.
  - Example: **NetSupportManager** sends a request to **geo.netsupportsoftware.com**.
  - **ScreenConnect** connects to a **subdomain** of the **official ScreenConnect.com domain**.
- **Advanced level**: Adversaries may **rename binaries** or **change file paths**.
  - Monitor for **process behavior** and **artifacts on the command line**.
  - Example: **ConnectWise ScreenConnect** launches with a **verbose series of parameters** (**E, Y, H**, etc.).
  - **Manual shell commands** in ScreenConnect may manifest as **run.cmd** files.
  - **AnyDesk** is often installed with the **install** and **silent** flags to **suppress user notifications**.
  - **TeamViewer** may run with **configuration** or **DRE flags**, and its **helper binaries** may appear with **action** or **log parameters**.

**Conclusion**:
- **ECRM adversaries** will likely **continue to use legitimate RMM tools** due to their **remote administration capabilities**, **ease of availability**, and **evasion of detections**.
- To detect and mitigate, it is crucial to **baseline your network**, **know expected RMM tools**, and **write detections** for **hosts**, **network artifacts**, and **process behaviors**.
