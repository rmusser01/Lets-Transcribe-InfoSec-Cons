**Arguments Against Banning Ransom Payments:**
- It will **cause pain** to affected companies.
- It will **force companies** to make illegal payments.

**Rebuttal to Arguments:**
- **Ransomware attacks** already cause significant pain and disruption.
- Companies **already make illegal payments** to avoid reporting requirements.

**Precedent for Banning Ransom Payments:**
- **Italy banned ransom payments** for kidnappings in 1991, claiming success in reducing kidnapping cases.
- However, **kidnapping cases were already declining** before the ban, calling the impact into question.

**U.S. State-Level Bans:**
- **Florida and North Carolina** have banned public entities from paying ransoms.
- **Reported ransomware attacks** in these states have not shown a significant decrease, indicating limited effectiveness.
- The assumption that **ransomware actors target specific states** is misleading, as they primarily target weaknesses.
- **Lack of transparent data** on the effectiveness of these bans makes it difficult to assess their true impact.

**Why Ban Ransom Payments?**
- The number of **ransomware attacks** is increasing, and current disruptions may not be enough to curb this trend.
- Banning payments could **disincentivize threat actors** from entering the ransomware business by reducing profitability.
- Ransomware is unique in that **threat actors publicly brag about their attacks**, unlike other forms of cybercrime.
- **Mandatory reporting of ransomware attacks** is proposed as a potential solution, providing better data for analysis.
- The UK is considering **mandatory reporting** and a licensing regime for payments, a step in the right direction.
- **Chain Analysis data** suggests a recent decrease in ransom payments, indicating that current efforts are having some impact.
- An outright ban on ransom payments, while extreme, may be the **least bad option** to address the growing problem of ransomware.

**Conclusion:**
The speaker advocates for banning ransom payments, arguing that it could be an effective measure to combat the increasing ransomware threat. While recognizing the potential pain and challenges associated with such a ban, the speaker believes that the current approach is not working, and more drastic action is needed.
