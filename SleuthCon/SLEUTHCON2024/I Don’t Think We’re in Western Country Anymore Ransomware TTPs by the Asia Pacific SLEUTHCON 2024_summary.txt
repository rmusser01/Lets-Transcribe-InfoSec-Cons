**Introduction**:
- Presentation by **Jono Davis**, senior analyst from **PwC's Threat Intelligence Team** at **SleuthCon 2024** in Arlington, VA.
- Focuses on the unique **tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)** of **ransomware** groups in the **Asia-Pacific** region, with a comparison to Western groups.

**Asia-Pacific vs. Western Ransomware**:
- Key differences in ransomware operations between the two regions.
- Asia-Pacific region exhibits distinct TTPs that set it apart from Western ransomware groups.

**Case Study 1: White Vellus**:
- Eastern European threat actor successfully breached an Asian organization.
- Initial access gained through a **cracked software** called **PTC Creo**, which included malicious files with similarities to later ransomware extensions.
- Suggests a potential insider threat or a carefully placed trap by the threat actor.
- Emphasizes the importance of basic security measures like **network segmentation**, **allow/deny lists for websites**, and **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.

**Case Study 2: LockBit Builder's Misuse**:
- Asian-Pacific based actor misused the **LockBit ransomware builder** but did not follow the group's usual TTPs.
- Actor pretended to be LockBit, demanding payment and providing a leak site, but no data exfiltration occurred.
- Communication was in **English**, which is an unusual development.
- Basic security measures like **patching vulnerabilities** and **regular password changes** could have prevented this intrusion.

**Case Study 3: Black Turtle**:
- Actors targeted **Veeam servers** first, indicating a potential trend in the region to prioritize rebuilding over paying ransoms.
- Used a **FortiGate SSL VPN vulnerability** to gain initial access, despite the victim being notified about this vulnerability four years ago.
- Emphasizes the need for **network segmentation**, **MFA**, and **vulnerability scanning**.

**WhiteDev173**:
- An open directory containing a suite of tools, including the **LockBit builder**, was discovered, indicating a potential Asia-Pacific-based actor.
- Tools mapped to the **MITRE ATT&CK framework** for analysis:
   - **Recon and Initial Access**: Used tools like **web scan logic**, **volmap**, **Xeon**, **XeonDXP** targeting IPs in **Korea**, **Taiwan**, **Iran**, and **mainland China**.
   - **Cobalt Strike**: Actor left an open directory, revealing usernames and passwords, with successful connections from **Hong Kong**.
   - **Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion**: Custom scripts and tools, some written in **Chinese**, to bypass defenses and gain higher privileges.
   - **Command and Control**: Custom scripts and tools to communicate with C2 servers.

**Defenses**:
- Overlap in defenses across case studies:
   - **MFA** on accounts, both local and remote.
   - **User entity-based analytics** to detect abnormal user activities.
   - Extensive **Anti-Virus (AV)** solutions and regular **vulnerability scanning**.

**Conclusion**:
- Ransomware in the Asia-Pacific region exhibits unique TTPs and targeting compared to Western groups.
- Basic security measures and quick wins can prevent or mitigate many of these attacks.
- The presentation highlights the importance of understanding regional differences in ransomware operations and adapting defenses accordingly.
