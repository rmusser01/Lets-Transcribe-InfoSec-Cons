**Introduction**
- Presenter: **Jason Killam**, Senior Detection Engineer at Red Canary
- Topic: Revoking code-signing certificates to disrupt malicious activities

**Code-Signing Certificates**
- Purchased from **certificate signers** like SSL.com or Sectigo
- Prevents **smart screens** and **security warnings** from flagging untrusted software
- **EV certificates** cost $1,500 to $3,000, requiring significant investment from malicious actors

**Examples of Malicious Signers**
- **Vidar**: Stealer pretending to be an installer for home automation software "Notion"
- Left: Malicious binary with generic information and signer "AndresDS"
- Right: Legitimate binary (MSBuild) with specific metadata and signer "Microsoft"

**Code-Signing Certificate Anatomy**
- **Name**: Friendly name identifying the developer
- **Certificate Authority**: Entity that issued the certificate (e.g., Cictego)
- **Valid From/To**: Timeline of certificate's validity, useful for incident response
- **Thumbprint**: Unique identifier for the certificate
- **Serial Number**: Another identifier, harder to spoof than the thumbprint

**Inconsistencies in Malicious Binaries**
- Shorter timeline from creation to detection compared to legitimate software
- Generic or misleading information in the binary details
- Unnecessary network connections to platforms like Telegram, Steam, or random IP addresses

**Example: Yellow Cockatoo**
- Signed by "Heart Craft Brewery," inconsistent with expected software developers
- Short timeline from creation to detection, indicating potential malicious activity
- Twitter post from "Squiggly Doo" highlighting the suspicious signer

**Call to Action**
- Example: **Russian Panda**'s team revoked certificates for "Defact Loader," disrupting the malware's operation
- Certificate revocation can be requested through email or web forms provided by signers like SSL.com and Sectigo
- **Squiggly Doo**'s tool on **GitHub** automates the process by generating emails with relevant information

**Revocation Process**
- Include contact info, binary details, and certificate identifiers (thumbprint, serial number)
- Explain the reason for revocation, providing attack chain details if necessary
- Emphasize the impact of revocation, especially for MSIX files, where it completely disrupts the installer

**Conclusion**
- Revoking code-signing certificates incurs financial and operational costs for malicious actors
- By disrupting their activities and establishing trust, revocation helps improve security for everyone
