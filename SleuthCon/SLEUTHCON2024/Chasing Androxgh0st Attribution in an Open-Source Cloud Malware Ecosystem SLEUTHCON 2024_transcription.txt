 Hey, thanks for joining me to speak about chasing Androx Ghost attribution in an open  source cloud malware ecosystem in the spooky dark.  Woo!  All right.  Oh, that one.  Okay.  Woo!  Cool.  All right.  So today we're going to cover a little bit about what Androx Ghost is, where you can  find it in the wild, which there are two malware families that it's associated with.  There are actually more than that.  We had to cut a couple for time, but we're going to cover two of the cool ones.  Then a little bit of wrapping up without looking at the conclusion.  About me.  Hi.  I am Alex Delamotte.  I'm a threat researcher at Sentinel Labs, which is part of Sentinel One.  Woo!  Yes.  We love S1.  I live in Las Vegas.  I am not a sleuth by trade.  I do technical analysis, meaning I take apart tools and malware.  My fun fact is that I started off my career in an internet service provider's network  operation center, which means I got to see a lot of really wild stuff.  And lastly, this talk represents only my own views, not those of any employer or cloud  service provider or anything like that.  All right.  So first, what is Androx Ghost?  Let's talk about that.  Androx Ghost is Python code that scrapes environment files and config files for secrets, and it  uses regular expressions to parse the files when they're exposed on a web server for strings  that are related to API keys, which can be used to conduct spamming attacks.  The earliest reference that we've seen to it was in December 2020, but there was a lot  of activity in 2022, and it continues today.  It primarily targets web servers using the Laravel PHP framework, which is notorious  for being misconfigured.  You can talk to all of your favorite dev and DevOps friends about that.  There's also a lot of comorbidity with WordPress, and the example on the slide here just shows  the credential for a Nexmo key, which is used to conduct SMS spamming or SMS API interactions  is being scraped so that the actor can then use it for spamming.  And how is it used?  It's rolled into Python tools.  As I noted, there are a couple of those malware families that are using it, and they are targeting  the cloud.  It performs credential harvesting using the extracted values that we've discussed, and  it was referenced in this GitHub issue which shows that basically they were locked out  of their web server after getting a message that just says access denied and rocks ghost.  And these tools will often obtain sensitive API keys and secrets and use them for badness  like conducting email spamming or SMS spamming or sell them to those who will, and, again,  locking them out of the web server is to hinder incident response and also just kind of establish  persistence.  Here we have a list of technologies that are targeted.  You can see that there's a lot of cloud service providers, but really they're targeting email  services because, again, the motivation is spam.  There are a couple that do SMS, but overall we have a lot of technologies that are enabling  communications here as well as some content management frameworks like Drupal, Prestashop,  all that good stuff.  Now what do we know about the origins of this tool?  A lot of the variable names are often identified as being in the Indonesian language or one  of the other languages of the region like Bahasa or Malay.  And so many cloud tools do have ties to Indonesia.  This is something that we've seen time and time again.  Like recently Datadog documented crypto mining attacks against ECS containers that were originating  from Indonesian IP space.  Permiso outlined their GU evil attack that also found Indonesia as a source for crypto  mining attacks.  We also had Invictus' danger dev report that found Indonesian IPs as a source for these  crypto mining attacks.  Obviously open source software is adopted by people all over the world, but the Indonesian  nexus and sustained cloud attack presence are certainly worth consideration for those  who have the capability to build relationships and disrupt the ecosystem.  Now how do we attribute these tools?  I call it slop sack.  These actors, they have a contact method inside of the tool, which is generally open source  anyway.  It's just Python code.  It's often unprotected.  They will have their handle or the tool's distribution channel handle inside of the  tool.  Usually it's telegram.  So there's often two pieces of information we can use to attribute here.  We have a telegram channel and then a telegram actor profile, which are generally two separate  handles.  These handles are often recycled across platforms so that they can be found more consistently.  Again, it's not a high level of op sack.  We found them on TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, everywhere like that.  What do you do with all of this information?  Well, let me Google that for you.  That's how we pivot in the world of cloud.  Next we'll talk about where to find Androx Ghost.  One of my favorites here is the Alien Fox Cloud Info Stealer, which was one of my first  reports working for Sentinel Labs, very close to my heart.  It is a multi-purpose cloud attack tool that focuses primarily on spamming, and it recently  focused on cryptocurrency wallet takeover by some of the developers who are maintaining  it.  And again, communal development means that one actor will add some features, another  will add more features, and there's just generally a whole lot of gray area with regard to  who is actively maintaining the tool or who did what, and also they all take credit for  each other's work.  So it's almost collaborative.  It's like collaborative ripping off one another.  It's a very strange world.  As far as attribution goes here, there are so many handles associated with this tool,  this family in particular, and actors tend to cycle through these handles fairly frequently.  And why might that be?  Well, they often rebrand into a new channel and try to get a different customer base or  affiliates and partners.  They might also exit scam, where they quit the scene and take the money, and then often  come back under a new handle.  And sometimes it just gets too hot.  There's too much attention to the handle.  We have here that there was some research put out on xcatzee, which was a fairly prolific  person in the Alien Fox scene, and they ultimately ended up abandoning their handle, and they  actually recently made a new channel called xcatzee re-up, saying they're going to be  coming back with some new stuff soon, but that was in February and no movement yet.  So a lot of these people are full of talk.  On the right, we have a table from the report that I published on Alien Fox that has 13  unique handles, including two that were for xcatzee.  So they were pretty prolific.  They're not doing a whole lot at this point, though.  Now, what we can do to find active handles is, again, kind of banal.  You search for the tool name in Telegram and see what comes up.  In this case, there were a whole bunch of results unrelated to the handles in the previous  slide, but that were actively being maintained.  One channel, which was called Alien underscore Fox 4, is run by the handle Alien Fox 1, which  is also run by another handle called Jaguar.  As you can see on the screenshot on the left of the file system, or hopefully you can see,  Jaguar LLC made that tool.  So we probably have the same person who's responsible for this active one here.  They're posting screenshots about, you know, selling their tools to people.  And then on the right, we have their Snap handle, which they advertise their tools on  Snapchat, which is kind of an interesting choice.  I haven't seen that a whole lot otherwise, and it could maybe indicate a regional nexus  where people are using Snapchat more than other platforms.  Now, where in the world could Jaguar Boss be?  Um, their Snap channel has multiple videos in heavily accented English, and the accents  certainly sound African or maybe West Indian.  And there's another video that has an announcement voice in an automated, like, background  announcement that is very clearly British English.  There's also an interesting conflict between the timestamps of the video on Snapchat and  what I was seeing on my computer.  Inside the video, the actors' devices showed March 9th, or they showed March 10th, and  it was only March 9th for me in the Pacific time zone.  So that suggests to me that they were probably somewhere in the Eastern Hemisphere.  They also have music in their Snaps that are from artists I was not familiar with before  this.  We have Carter FA, Ruger, BNXN, and I wasn't familiar with them, but I looked them up,  and they're all Nigerian artists.  And lastly, they use a QWERTY keyboard.  On the right, we see that there is a keyboard here, and a consistent theme is they're always  using the same-looking MacBook with a QWERTY keyboard.  So based on this, I think it's pretty safe to infer that the actor is probably based  in Western Africa, likely Nigeria, based on the pop culture, although I don't know how  that diaspora works entirely.  All right.  Moving on to FBOT.  This is another family of Cloud Info Stealer.  It's a multi-purpose cloud attack tool, just like Alien Fox, really, but it's a little  bit different because it runs on infrastructure that's hosted by the developer or the person  currently maintaining it.  This is in contrast with other cloud attack tools because they usually integrate API calls  to things like Shodan, Leak9, Zumai, Security Trails.  We've seen them using all kinds of services that we security professionals use to identify  vulnerable websites to attack.  Instead, this actor runs their own infrastructure, which the people who use their tool can use  to identify vulnerable websites for targeting.  It shares code with the Legion Info Stealer, which was covered by Permiso and Cato Security  a while ago.  It's very similar to Alien Fox, maybe a little bit more professional and centralized, but  it shares the same checkout website, which is really interesting.  It uses a Lithuanian fashion designer's website to validate PayPal accounts.  There's this one URL that it will make a call to that doesn't seem to exist when you navigate  to that website, and it's using that to validate whether it's an active PayPal account or not.  Lastly, it is very Indonesia-centric.  We have a few data points that we'll dive into on this.  All right.  So who made FBOT?  It really depends on how far back you're looking.  All of the known samples contain references to idevexploit.io in a core part of the code,  which was also an Androx ghost indicator from some much older samples, too, that was used  as a hard-coded IM profile username, so it's reasonable to believe that they've been around  for a while.  They were probably responsible for some of these older malware families and then kind  of spun off FBOT into their own.  We have here on the slide a funny message that they put in there that translates to  we didn't fully use our senses and thoughts when making this BangSAD bot.  I think BangSAD didn't translate right, but anyway, there's a consistent theme of these  people saying that they are making a tool and they're not liable for how it's used.  You know, something that I'm sure we've all seen and heard a lot.  So as far as who's currently maintaining it, we see that it's currently maintained by someone  named rep.  So kind of missed that there.  The active handle that is maintaining it is at callmerep, and you can see that in the  very badass ASCII art on the right.  Very hacker stuff.  So we looked them up on Telegram, and it shows their personal account.  We have so many different handles.  Then their business account is the rep project account, which is used to market and kind  of use communications for FBOT and other tools that they're working on.  And then they're associated with the Indonesian Darknet Telegram group, which is a group that  has about 3,000 members and seems pretty active.  And then on the top right, there's an interesting post that I added here, because it's talking  about server maintenance, but uses a lips and heart emoji, which is just kind of an  interesting choice to use to talk to people about maintenance being complete.  I think that this is indicative of a consistent theme with this group, where the actors tend  to use different handles for different genders, and they kind of, like, swap between them.  They have a bit of an identity crisis, and it's just kind of interesting to watch from  afar.  So as far as who actively maintains FBOT, we still have this on rep.  I had to get the screenshot from a VM.  So their website is currently down, and I had a VM screenshot that was available, so  I was able to grab this, which was definitely a relief, because otherwise there was nothing.  I think you've all probably noticed that Google Cache stopped working recently.  So there's a lot of historical services that we're using for analysis that are no longer  available.  So it really underscores the importance of documenting your work as you go, and not expecting  anything to be there forever.  So about RepCyber, the screen cap states that the service is a project to make your cyber  security activities more easier and more efficient, with an option to scan an IP address or  domain.  Again, that infrastructure part that we were discussing.  So I can't scan it right now, because the website is down, so there's no output.  I don't know what it would have done.  But there was a lot of feedback in the Indonesian Darknet Telegram group about Rep service  becoming unreliable.  So it seems like it's kind of in question whether they're still active.  But again, having that infrastructure does give people another avenue to potentially  disrupt and investigate the nature of this tool.  And on the right, we have a screenshot of Rep's GitHub account, which shows that they  work at Google, are based in Russia, identify as a hacktivist, and again, references the  RepCyber website.  Okay.  So a little bit about Rep's GitHub.  There are a lot of fun connections on that GitHub, and I have to give thanks to my friend  who couldn't make it here, Lacey Kasten, aka Coran Kovey.  She gave me a lot of help with just kind of pivoting from Rep's GitHub and finding a lot  of really interesting connections that we're going to dive into here.  There was a removed commit on the top left where it had their ASCII art Rep project and  some of their social handles, including a Facebook handle, which we put the screenshot  on the bottom left of the Facebook account.  And then in the updated version from that commit, it says, trying not to be a skid.  So they removed the ASCII art in an effort to not be a skid.  Heartwarming.  The Facebook account was created in 2018, but there were no posts until December of  2022, which is an interesting and relevant timeline.  Pay attention to the timeline here, because we're going to be diving into that a bit more.  They advertise tools.  This Facebook is used to, like, market their tools.  So an interesting choice for Facebook.  On GitHub, there are also references to a handle that is called Replicant, which is  a computer host name that was used to push code to the GitHub.  And we found that Replicant actually links back to a player on several Indonesia-based  high school CTF teams.  So not only is this a skid, but it's possibly a high school skid.  Oof.  All right.  Now, as far as who maintains fbot, we still have this rep handle.  Repcyber was used on TikTok, and we have a first initial and a last name there.  But the attribution is really shaky and unclear.  The TikTok is very unusual.  It's many videos of a young woman, and usually there are no words.  It's just kind of original audio, which I guess is used to bypass the copyright filter  if you are using non-original audio.  I don't know that it actually was.  But there are lots of videos of this woman just kind of looking serenely at the camera,  and often she'll show up with family members.  There are captions that I've translated, but there's almost never any speaking.  There are also some videos of a man with hair that looks suspiciously like the GitHub profile  avatar that we covered earlier.  So that's a little cryptic.  There are also videos where she talks very uncertainly about a dark past.  And a questionable future.  Several of the TikToks reference movies about dark stories, including one where a man in  the mafia is killed to save his partner and their child.  And then the account just completely stopped posting abruptly in June 2022,  after like daily multiple posts.  Just nothing.  No obvious farewell message.  Highly unusual.  It's really unclear what happened here.  But again, we have the December 2022 timeline where suddenly they open up a YouTube channel  under the call me rep handle.  And this YouTube channel is very much associated with the actor.  It's used to distribute or to advertise the tools and just show how to use them.  So instructional.  But then there is the piece de resistance.  This video is called a POC for CVE 2022-I miss her.  Oh, buddy.  The actor shows a demo of a tool called multi detector, which is a Golang-based tool for  processing data at scale.  Sounds like buzzwords.  But again, to summarize, we know that FBOT is maintained by the handle call me rep, who  is going through some things.  They're likely living in Indonesia, based on the videos from TikTok and also the multiple  linguistic indicators that we discussed.  They might be a high school student based on the CTF teams linked to their GitHub.  Call me rep started being active in September 2022.  That was the earliest that we saw that handle.  Three months after the rep cyber TikTok stalked activity.  The video here shows that the actor wishes they were with her.  And TLDR, this actor's illicit activity is being portrayed as a result of someone coping  with a difficult breakup.  Feelings, am I right?  Oh, wait.  We have Predator here.  I don't know.  How are we on time?  I'm good?  All right.  Let's do Predator.  I didn't think we were going to do Predator.  All right.  Awesome.  Okay.  Yeah, we can do that.  All right.  So Predator is another cloud info stealer.  This one has a lot of buzzwords.  We've got both AI and a GUI.  Woo.  It's got integrated chat GPT powered user help mode.  With conditional exceptions that do not call out to the chat GPT API.  It will handle some things locally, which is certainly cost effective.  But also bad for OPSEC, as we'll see.  Okay.  There we go.  So there are a whole lot of handles in this tool in Predator.  How do you really figure it out when you have, like, six unique handles there?  Who is responsible for this tool?  We have OB Hacking, which is a group related to Gray Hat Hackers, another telegram hacking  group that's adminned by a guy named MR0X01, which seems fairly promising there at the top.  And if you use the chat GPT interface that I really hacked together here and ask, who made  you, it actually has MR0X01 there.  So it also references a GitHub handle that is it's basically gibberish.  L4GTR4.  So I apologize in advance for saying this over and over again.  But yeah, let's take a look at that GitHub profile.  So what about it?  It's dead.  It 404s now.  But luckily, they do have some other social media presence where they're recycling that handle.  And it was used on a Twitter account with only a few posts about bug bounty.  And it was also used for a HackerOne bug bounty with a location as Meknes, Morocco,  an imperial city in Morocco with historical significance.  Not sure how their internet is or whether they're likely to have tech people there,  but it's kind of an interesting indicator.  Now, again, what about that GitHub profile?  Good thing that I took screenshots before it was taken down.  So we still have here that it was one in the same, the L4GTR.  So again, it just kind of reiterates the need to document your research and not believe that  anything will be there in two months.  So who is this person?  Their profile and their posts on social media are consistently in Arabic.  There's a Python class within Predator that does translation.  And you'll see that the first listed language is AR-MA, which is for Moroccan Arabic.  A pretty niche choice.  So I think it's pretty reasonable to assume that we at least have somebody in Morocco here.  Their Twitter is, again, also in Arabic.  Most of the posts, as far as I can tell, are kind of like crypto spam posts.  It's really weird.  They were actually quite political a few months ago, but they seem to have slowed down on that  front for whatever reason.  They were posting a lot about the conflict that's happening in Palestine and Israel.  So, okay.  What's their deal?  Again, they're all in Arabic.  What's their deal?  Again, they're often heavily condemning Western countries and pro-Hamas.  I found this picture on their telegram, and it has like F the US, Israel and France, and  it's got this guy with a gun there.  And I looked it up, and apparently it's a Hamas guy from 2014.  So I don't know why we're still posting this.  I didn't like the way that was.  So let's make it look better.  Okay.  That's better.  I can work with this.  Cool.  Oh, also, they love the US, Israel and France.  Okay.  Much better.  So to summarize, we know that this person is the main Predator developer.  They live in Morocco, possibly Meknes.  They have some political views, and they might be feeling the burn that they're feeling.  They're not sure what they're talking about.  They have some political views, and they might be feeling the burn that comes with having  sloppy OPSEC based on some information I've received.  So to summarize, what does it all mean?  Cloud tools are special.  It's often not this easy to find so much about other types of cyber criminals.  I would say that because it's all open source, we have a special window into their world.  To reiterate, I'm a simple malware researcher, not a criminal investigator or an OSINT specialist,  but I'm confident that people with those special skills and connections could certainly fully  dox these actors because of their sloppiness.  Actors are also incentivized to sell their tools, not to maintain high OPSEC.  So they market the tools with disclaimers saying that they take no responsibility for  how the tool is used, but is that a valid take?  I don't know.  Most of these actors are in developing countries, as we've discussed.  You know, we had Morocco, Nigeria, and Indonesia.  They're all certainly not part of the West.  I think that the minimal amount of money you probably get from spamming is a lot more valuable  there.  So does local law enforcement care about that kind of activity?  Should they care?  If they do, the OPSEC will certainly improve, and we're going to lose insight into the tool  development, but it is certainly an avenue for disruption.  And just to wrap up, cloud attack tool devs have a lower bar for OPSEC.  We've been over that.  The consistent theme is that they only make the tools, that they are not responsible for  how they're used.  We see this a lot with C2 frameworks, too, with red teaming stuff.  Is it accurate, like you're only making a tool?  Are you complicit with the abuse?  Again, they often frequently burn and rotate channels and handles, which makes cloud tool  attribution hard.  Let's go shopping.  It would be fun.  And lastly, just a friendly reminder to other threat intelligence professionals that the  services that we rely on are being burned and destroyed at an alarming rate.  Things like Google cache, passive total, I rely on day to day, and they're going to be  dead, if not already dead.  So, we need to document everything as we go, and also to develop robust solutions to replace  the things that disappear.  So, yeah, here's some related research.  Woo.  Okay.  I'll let you take a screenshot.  Cool.  Booze.  Cool.  All right, Aaron, yes?  Like 2018 to 2020, there was like an IoT botnet called EpiBot.  Is that related to the infrastructure you guys bought at all?  Unrelated.  It was a poor naming choice on my part.  I found out about that after I had named it.  But, you know, I couldn't just walk around calling it what it was called.  So, yeah.  Yes?  Yes.  That's a great question, and I've been wondering the same thing.  I actually took a detour to Morocco when I was near Malaga a few months ago, just to  kind of check it out, and it was really harrowing as an experience for me.  It's certainly a very, very low cost of living.  So, I think they're incentivized by that money making opportunity.  But there is also an influx of Western money going there because, you know, there are places  like Casablanca and Marrakesh that are beautiful cities.  So, I think that maybe there is more of an influx of information and technology infrastructure  to host people visiting.  So, maybe even like a tourism push is somehow enabling more cyber activity.  Again, it might be far-fetched, but just a thought.  Yes?  That's a great question.  It definitely depends on the individual tool.  For FBOT, we see that they're selling almost exclusively to the Indonesian devs.  But they post in the Indonesian languages often.  And then for things like Alien Fox, it's usually posted in English, which, again,  Western African cybercrime.  So, it really just depends on the tools.  They seem to serve their local region, though.  Presumably, where we've seen the developer kind of building their brand is also where  their customer base lies.  Am I missing any?  Any more questions?  Oh, no, I can't see your hand.  OK, yeah, please.  So, it's actually just using the chat GPT API.  So, it is built into their tool, and they make API calls through it.  But they have a couple of exceptions that'll handle things locally.  Like, if they're asking about a specific data set that was collected from the tool,  it'll handle that locally instead of going out to chat GPT and wasting money.  And they put their handle into one of those models, I guess?  Yeah, they put a handle into one of those exception cases that says,  if they say, who made you, to the AI assistant, it'll say, I was made by MR0X01.  Yep.  Anyone else?  All right.  Thank you.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!
