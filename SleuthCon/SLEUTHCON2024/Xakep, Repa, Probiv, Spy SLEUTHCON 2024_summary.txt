**Russia's Cybercrime Ecosystem:**
- Russia has one of the **oldest and largest cybercrime undergrounds** globally, fueled by a **technically skilled population** and a **failing economy**.
- **System language checks** in malware indicate an **unspoken agreement** between cybercriminals and the Russian government, where certain countries are exempt from attacks.
- Russia's **permissive stance** on cybercrime and its **refusal to collaborate** with international law enforcement enable cybercriminals to operate with impunity.
- The **Budapest Convention**, which Russia did not sign, is an example of Russia prioritizing its **national sovereignty** over addressing cybercrime.
- A **cybercrime index** by the University of Oxford ranks Russia as the top country for cybercrime, followed by Ukraine.
- The **FBI's Cyber Most Wanted list** further highlights the prevalence of Russian cybercriminals.

**Russian Intelligence Services' Involvement:**
- The **GRU**, **FSB**, and **SVR** interact differently with the cybercrime underground:
  - **GRU**: Utilizes crimeware and buys malware/services from cybercriminals, taking advantage of **plausible deniability**.
  - **FSB**: Recruits cybercriminals for joint operations and leverages their capabilities/infrastructure. The **Yahoo hack** is an example of this collaboration.
  - **SVR**: Observes the cyber underground, leveraging opportunities (e.g., **buying access** from credential marketplaces) without direct engagement.

**Case Studies:**
- **TURLA**: A GRU-affiliated group that exploited USB malware infections to regain access to targeted organizations.
- **The Da Vinci Group**: A company offering **information access services**, likely connected to the FSB, as indicated by Ukrainian advisories.
- **SVR's Infostealer Cookie Attack**: SVR used a stolen cookie from an infostealer malware to gain access to a **Microsoft 365 environment**.
- **SVR's Use of Commercial Offensive Security Tools**: SVR leverages cracked tools shared on Russian-speaking telegram channels and forums.
- **GRU's Co-optation of a Cybercriminal Botnet**: GRU monitored and repurposed a cybercriminal botnet for its own campaigns.

**Cybercriminals and Russia's Agenda:**
- Cybercriminals are often **on-call** to support the Russian government, as seen in the case of **defacement attacks** and **data leaks** against Ukraine before the war.
- The **current ransom war** targets Western countries, with Russia making selective arrests to signal and distract, maintaining its image.
- Cybercriminals from Ukraine have shifted their focus to exclusively target their own country, indicating their alignment with Russia's interests.

**Conclusions and Further Reading:**
- Cybercrime is **intertwined** with Russian intelligence services, and analysts should consider this when investigating intrusions, especially for **high-value targets**.
- The relationship between cybercrime and espionage blurs, and the financial incentives for cybercriminals ensure the cycle continues.
- Recommended readings include the **Recorded Futures dark covenant paper** and articles by the **Atlantic Council**.
